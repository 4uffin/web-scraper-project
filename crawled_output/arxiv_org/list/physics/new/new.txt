Title:
An objective criterion for evaluating new physical theories
Yefim Bakman

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
Currently, the value of a new physical theory is determined by whether it has been published in a prestigious journal. Yet, to publish an article in a prestigious journal, one must undergo a rigorous process of independent subjective peer review, with the success of the theory depending on the subjective opinion of reviewers who have proven themselves in developing old theories of physics. As a result, a closed system (gatekeeping) has been created that does not allow the penetration of new theories, especially those that call into question the established paradigm. A subjective approach is not uniquely possible. Here, we propose an objective criterion for evaluating new physical theories and illustrate this criterion through an example.

The potential for reactive metal fuels to enhance the energetic output of high explosives has generated an enduring interest in the study of composite explosives. It has typically been demonstrated that added metal fuels can have little or even deleterious impact on the accelerating ability of composite military explosives relative to baseline performance. Often this has led to the assumption of limited reaction of the metal fuel over microsecond timescales. The widespread availability of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry has enabled time resolved measurement of accelerated confinement, ultimately demonstrating prompt reaction of metal fuels. Motivated by this observation, hydrocode modelling studies, and prior author's modifications of Taylor's tubular bomb model, we developed a differential equation form of Taylor's model in a manner where it is straightforward to add sources or phases. An afterburning version of the JWL equation of state was used to add energy to the gaseous products at a linear, time-dependent rate. The metal particles are assumed to remain in velocity equilibrium with the gaseous products and do not transfer heat or influence chemical composition. We focus exclusively on added aluminum as it remains the most ubiquitous choice of metal fuel. The model is initialized with a CJ state calculated from Cheetah 2.0 assuming the Al particles are inert in the detonation. JWL coefficients for the baseline explosive are also used. Qualitative agreement is observed between the model and previously published experiments.

Non-Equatorial Uniform-Stress Space Elevators

Comments:
This paper was first published in Proc. of the 3rd International Space Elevator Conference, June 2004, reprinted on arXiv by permission of Bradley Edwards former director at ISR
Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Non-equatorial space elevators are interesting as they give more freedom for anchor location, avoid the highly occupied geosynchronous orbit and the areas of highest radiation in the Van Allen belts. We review the static equation for a uniform-stress tether, and use it to study the tapering of a uniform-stress tether in a general potential field. We then focus on a rotating coulomb potential and study the range of latitudes that are allowed for a uniform-stress space elevator. Finally, we look at a few practical issues that are raised by non-equatorial space elevators.

Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)
The dynamics of a test particle in the field of a model galaxy proposed by Serge Aubry is studied by a combination of theory and numerical computation. Regimes of near-integrable behaviour and almost perfect chaos are found. A proposed explanation for the latter is sketched. Thoughts are presented on the implications of the analysis for galaxies.

The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is a light shining through a wall experiment probing the existence of axions and axion-like particles using a 1064 nm laser source. While ALPS II is already taking data using a heterodyne based detection scheme, cryogenic transition edge sensor (TES) based single-photon detectors are planned to expand the detection system for cross-checking the potential signals, for which a sensitivity on the order of $10^{-24}$ W is required. In order to reach this goal, we have investigated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) as binary classifiers to distinguish the experimentally measured 1064 nm photon triggered (light) pulses from background (dark) pulses. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimization, the CNN based binary classifier did not outperform our previously optimized cut-based analysis in terms of detection significance. This suggests that the used approach is not generally suitable for background suppression and improving the energy resolution of the TES. We partly attribute this to the training confusion induced by near-1064 nm black-body photon triggers in the background, which we identified as the limiting background source as concluded in our previous works. However, we argue that the problem ultimately lies in the binary classification based approach and believe that regression models would be better suitable for addressing the energy resolution. Unsupervised machine learning models, in particular neural network based autoencoders, should also be considered potential candidates for the suppression of noise in time traces. While the presented results and associated conclusions are obtained for TES designed to be used in the ALPS II experiment, they should hold equivalently well for any device whose output signal can be considered as a univariate time trace.

Motional representation; the ability to predict odor characters using molecular vibrations
Yuki Harada, Shuichi Maeda, Junwei Shen, Taku Misonou, Hirokazu Hori, Shinichiro Nakamura
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The prediction of odor characters is still impossible based on the odorant molecular structure. We designed a CNN-based regressor for computed parameters in molecular vibrations (CNN\_vib), in order to investigate the ability to predict odor characters of molecular vibrations. In this study, we explored following three approaches for the predictability; (i) CNN with molecular vibrational parameters, (ii) logistic regression based on vibrational spectra, and (iii) logistic regression with molecular fingerprint(FP). Our investigation demonstrates that both (i) and (ii) provide predictablity, and also that the vibrations as an explanatory variable (i and ii) and logistic regression with fingerprints (iii) show nearly identical tendencies. The predictabilities of (i) and (ii), depending on odor descriptors, are comparable to those of (iii). Our research shows that odor is predictable by odorant molecular vibration as well as their shapes alone. Our findings provide insight into the representation of molecular motional features beyond molecular structures.

Low-energy proton impact dynamics on hydrocarbons: Dependence on kinetic energy and incident site

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
The dynamics of low-energy proton collisions with hydrocarbon with hydrocarbon molecules are investigated using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. Through systematic variation of proton kinetic energy and impact site on the molecular surface, the resulting scattering, proton capture, and bond dissociation pathways are analyzed. The simulations reveal a strong dependence of reaction outcomes on both incident energy and collision geometry, with the interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom highlighted as governing molecular fragmentation and reaction mechanisms.

The Quantum Method of Planes - Local Pressure Definitions for Machine Learning Potentials
E. R. Smith
Comments:

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
Stress or Pressure is a central quantity in engineering, and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is not valid away from thermodynamic equilibrium, a common state required in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area but derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing quantum mechanical (QM) physics in classical simulation. We present the derivation of the MoP stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving & Kirkwood (1950). For the testcase of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate the MoP is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP are provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.

Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.

This book is devoted to an informal discussion of patterns constructed for treating physical problems. Such patterns, when sufficiently formalized, are usually referred as "models", and tents to be applied not only in physics, but conquer the fields traditionally occupied by other disciplines generally considered to be different from physics. The author calls this unification of seemingly disjoint results a "physmatical effect" - pointing to the fact that multitudes of fine - grained physics-based mathematical models become inextricably linked and networked. Mathematics serves as a key code gluing together isolated physical models viewed as nodes of this network.

Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)
A novel method and experimental configuration are proposed that allow the collection of high-quality X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data in transmission mode on a standard laboratory diffractometer. This configuration makes use of components that have been developed for application in modern laboratory diffractometers, such as X-ray tubes with enhanced stability, accurate goniometers and position-sensitive photon-counting detectors with improved energy resolution. Such approach may extend the application of XAS in materials research, particularly for users of diffraction methods.

The LZ experiment is a liquid xenon time-projection chamber (TPC) searching for evidence of particle dark matter interactions. In the simplest assumption of elastic scattering, many dark matter models predict an energy spectrum which rises quasi-exponentially with decreasing energy transfer to a target atom. LZ expects to detect coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering of $^{8}$B solar neutrinos, the signal from which is very similar to a dark matter particle with mass of about 5.5 GeV/$c^{2}$, which result in typical nuclear recoil energies of $<$5 keV$_{\text{nr}}$. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to calibrate the response of recoiling xenon nuclei to keV-energy recoils. This analysis details the first in situ photoneutron calibration of the LZ detector and probes its response in this energy regime.

We present a study of the emission of Cherenkov radiation in thick media, explore the limitations of the simulation tools currently in use in particle and nuclear physics, and propose a method for overcoming these limitations. We start with a derivation of the Cherenkov power spectrum and its angular profile, accounting for interference of the radiation emitted, in contrast with commonly used tools that assume perfect coherence. We then study the impact that the path of electrons through a medium has on the angular profile of Cherenkov light. Finally, we devise a model that can introduce these effects in Geant4 and tune it to explain calibration data from the water-phase of SNO+. We find that the tuned model significantly improves the agreement between data and simulation, so we provide it for its wider use.

Detector and event visualization are crucial components of high-energy physics~(HEP) experimental software. Virtual Reality~(VR) technologies and multimedia development platforms such as Unity offer enhanced display effects and flexible extensibility for visualization in HEP experiments. In this study, we present a VR-based method for detector and event displays in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory~(JUNO) experiment. This method shares the same detector geometry descriptions and event data model as those in offline software and provides necessary data conversion interfaces. The VR methodology facilitates an immersive exploration of the virtual environment in JUNO, enabling users to investigate detector geometry, visualize event data, and tune the detector simulation and event reconstruction algorithms. Additionally, this approach supports applications in data monitoring, physics data analysis, and public outreach initiatives.

Exponential Spectral Scaling: Robust and Efficient Stellarator Boundary Optimization via Mode-Dependent Scaling
Byoungchan Jang, Rory Conlin, Matt Landreman
Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Stellarator boundary optimization faces a fundamental numerical challenge: the extreme disparity between low- and high-mode amplitudes creates an optimization landscape in which direct full-spectrum approaches typically converge to poor local minima. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed through a computationally expensive, multi-step Fourier continuation, in which low Fourier modes are optimized first, followed by the gradual incorporation of higher modes. We present Exponential Spectral Scaling (ESS), a technique that applies a mode-dependent exponential scaling factor to each Fourier mode. Our primary implementation uses the $L_{\infty}$ norm to determine the scaling pattern, creating a square spectral decay profile that effectively reduces the dynamic range of optimization variables from $10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ to $10^{2}$--$10^{3}$. This scaling aligns with the natural spectral decay of physically meaningful configurations and enables direct single-step optimization using the full spectrum of boundary Fourier modes. ESS eliminates arbitrary staging decisions and reduces computation time by a factor of $2$ to $5$ in benchmark cases. In addition to accelerating optimization, ESS improves robustness, reducing sensitivity to initial conditions and increasing confidence in avoiding local optima. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESS across both quasi-axisymmetric (QA) and quasi-helically symmetric (QH) configurations, using two distinct optimization toolkits: SIMSOPT and DESC.

In Praise of Slowness

Subjects:
Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)
While speed is an ubiquitous concept in physics, its inverse - known as slowness - sometimes proves more relevant. We discuss some case studies within classical physics where such a notion is fruitful, before exploring how it can be realized within the relativistic and thermodynamical frameworks. This leads us to a generalized slowness, not specifically defined in relation with speed but as characterizing the evolution of any physical parameter. We advocate the pedagogical relevance of slowness, by analogy with other couples of quantities, inverse of each other, commonly used in physics.

Optics (physics.optics)
Monolayers of transition metal dichacogenides show strong second-order nonlinearity and symmetry-driven selection rules from their three-fold lattice symmetry. This process resembles the valley-contrasting selection rules for photoluminescence in these materials. However, the underlying physical mechanisms fundamentally differ since second harmonic generation is a coherent process, whereas photoluminescence is incoherent, leading to distinct interactions with photonic nanoresonators. In this study, we investigate the far- field circular polarization properties of second harmonic generation from MoS$_2$ monolayers resonantly interacting with spherical gold nanoparticles. Our results indicate that the coherence of the second harmonic allows its polarization to be mostly preserved, unlike in an incoherent process, where the polarization is scrambled. These findings provide important insights for future applications in valleytronics and quantum nanooptics, where both coherent and incoherent processes can be probed in such hybrid systems without altering sample geometry or operational wavelength.

Optics (physics.optics)
Miniaturized microscopes (miniscopes) have opened a new frontier in animal behavior studies, enabling real-time imaging of neuron activity while leaving animals largely unconstrained. Canonical designs typically use Gradient-Index (GRIN) lenses or refractive lenses as the objective module for excitation and fluorescence collection, but GRIN lenses suffer from aberrations and refractive lenses are bulky and complex. Meta-optics, composed of subwavelength diffractive elements, offer a promising alternative by combining multiple functionalities with significantly reduced footprint and weight. Here, we present meta-optical miniscopes that integrate functionalities including large field of view (FOV), extended depth of focus (EDOF), and depth sensitivity. These meta-optics replace the traditional refractive lens assembly, reducing the total track length of the objective module from 6.7 mm to 2.5 mm while enhancing imaging performance. Our results demonstrate that meta-optical miniscopes can expand the miniscope toolbox and facilitate the development of more compact and multifunctional imaging systems.

Phase matching in Vector Beam Driven High Harmonic Generation with 3D-printed Gas Cells

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
We present experimental results of high harmonic generation(HHG) driven by a 1300 nm beam in three different polarization states: linear, radial, and azimuthal. We found that the optimal pressure for phasematching was roughly twice as high for the vector beam drivers than the linear driver. We attribute this difference in pressure primarily to the Gouy phase, which differs by a factor of two between the linear and vector polarization states. We demonstrate a target for HHG that produces a uniform pressure profile in the interaction region that is nearly identical to the backing pressure, and preserves the mode of the driving beam. We provide characterization and validation of this technique through flow simulations and experimental measurements.

On the application of refractive index matching to study the buoyancy-driven motion of spheres

Comments:
17 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Refractive index matching (RIM) is a powerful tool for multiphase flow studies as it eliminates optical distortions and enables high-fidelity tomographic measurements near solid-fluid interfaces of freely moving solids in the flow. However, by improving the RIM and optical quality, the solids become effectively invisible, preventing direct identification of their location. To address this limitation, we develop a physics-informed detection framework that locates transparent spheres within time-resolved tomographic Particle Tracking Velocimetry by combining tracer voids, vertical velocity signatures, and vortex structures into a unified optimization problem. Integrated with volumetric reconstructions, the method provides simultaneous analysis of velocity, pressure, and force on the sphere. Applied to an example case of an 11.11 mm acrylic sphere rising in a RIM sodium iodide solution, the technique reveals a clear phase-locked relation between double-thread wake structures, surface-pressure distributions, and unsteady hydrodynamic forces over half a cycle of the sphere motion in the 4R vortex shedding regime. For the first time, this enables direct calculation of drag and lift histories on a freely moving sphere. The framework can be extended to dynamic masking for improved tomographic reconstruction and pressure-field calculations, to non-spherical bodies with more complex motions, and to multi-body interactions, advancing RIM from a flow-only diagnostic to a tool for fully coupled body-wake measurements.

In previous study [1], we proposed a new physical law applicable to both particle and thermodynamical systems. Additionally, we introduced a physical definition of chaos and self-organization. In the present work, we extend this novel interaction scheme to various thermodynamical systems in order to test the universality of the proposed law. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of these systems also exhibit chaotic behavior under different conditions. We discussed the relationship between chaotic dynamics and the least action, and for the first time, we proposed the "Chaotic Action Principle" (CAP). Furthermore, we examined the validity of the physical and philosophical foundations of this new law and the associated definition of chaos. Finally, based on CAP, we proposed a new conceptual definition of complexity.

Non-Newtonian viscous fluid models with learned rheology accurately reproduce Lagrangian sea ice simulations
Gonzalo G. de Diego, Georg Stalder
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Polar sea ice is crucial to Earth's climate system. Its dynamics also affect coastal communities, wildlife, and global shipping. Sea ice is typically modeled as a continuum fluid using a model proposed almost 50 years, which is moderately accurate for packed ice, but loses its predictive accuracy outside of the central ice pack. Discrete element methods (DEMs) offer an alternative by resolving the behavior of individual ice floes, including collisions, frictional contact, fracture, and ridging. However, DEMs are generally too costly for large-scale simulations. To address this, we present a framework for inferring rheological behavior from DEM velocity data. We characterize isotropic constitutive laws as scalar functions of the principal invariants of the strain-rate tensor. These functions are parameterized by neural networks trained on DEM data. By combining machine learning and finite element methods, we incorporate the governing partial differential equation (PDE) into the training, requiring to solve a PDE-constrained optimization problem for the network parameters. We find that, over a wide range of ice concentrations, the velocity fields observed in a complex sea ice DEM can be captured by a nonlinear rheology. Depending on the ice concentration, a shear-thinning or a shear-thickening behavior is observed. Moreover, the effective shear viscosity is found to increase by several orders of magnitude with changes as small as 5% in the sea ice concentration. We show that the learned rheology generalizes to different forcing scenarios, time-dependent problems, and settings in which compressibility is not a dominant factor. For these reasons, our framework represents a major step towards developing non-Newtonian models that accurately reproduce observed sea ice dynamics.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) delivers a wide variety of rare isotopes as fast, stopped, or reaccelerated beams to enable forefront research in nuclear structure, astrophysics, and fundamental interactions. To expand the scientific potential of FRIB's stopped and reaccelerated beam programs, we are designing a Multi-Reflection Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer and separator (MR-ToF MS). It will enable high-precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes, improve beam diagnostics, and deliver isobarically and isomerically purified beams to downstream experimental stations. It is designed to store ions at a kinetic energy of 30 keV, significantly enhancing ion throughput while maintaining high mass resolving power. We present the scientific motivation, technical design, and simulations demonstrating the expected performance of the system, which has the potential to significantly enhance FRIB's mass measurement, diagnostic, and mass separation capabilities.

Certain flow structures trap active microorganisms over extended periods, impacting mortality and growth by inhibiting foraging, exploration, and predator evasion. We show that transport barriers and trapping of a microswimmer in unsteady vortex flow can be understood in terms of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) in phase space, taking into account both flow and swimming dynamics. These phase-space LCS constrain when and how artificial microswimmers can be trained by reinforcement learning to escape traps. Our results suggest that phase-space LCS can explain training failure and success in a broad class of navigation problems.

The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities made of Niobium is tied to the quality of their inner surfaces exposed to the radio frequency (RF) waves. Future superconducting particle accelerators, because of their dimensions or the unprecedented stringent technical requirements, require the development of innovative surface processing techniques to improve processing reliability and if possible ecological footprint and cost, compared to conventional chemical processes. Metallographic polishing (MP) has emerged as a promising polishing technology to address these challenges. Previous studies focused on the characterization of the processed material surface at room temperature in the absence of RF waves. However, the evaluation of material properties, such as surface resistance under RF, at cryogenic temperature has failed, primarily due to the unavailability of devices capable of achieving the necessary resolution in the nanohm range. To overcome this limitation, a quadrupole resonator (QPR) has been utilized. The RF results demonstrate that the MP polishing, developed to preserve a high-quality niobium surface with very low surface resistance, is highly effective compared to conventional polishing. This conclusion is further supported by topography and microstructural analysis of the QPR top-hat samples, which revealed the clear superiority of the metallographic approach.

The growing demand for low-latency, energy-efficient inference in large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed interest in heterogeneous architectures. While GPUs remain dominant, they are poorly suited for integration with emerging domain-specific accelerators like the Photonic Tensor Units (PTUs), which offer low-power, high-throughput linear computation. This motivates hybrid compilation strategies that combine photonic and electronic resources. We present LightCode, a compiler framework and simulator for mapping LLM inference workloads across hybrid photonic-electronic systems. LightCode introduces the Stacked Graph, an intermediate representation that encodes multiple hardware-specific realizations of each tensor operation. Hardware assignment is formulated as a constrained subgraph selection problem optimized for latency or energy under parametric cost models. We evaluate LightCode on the prefill stage of GPT-2 and Llama-7B showing that under our workload and hardware assumptions, (i) Photonic hardware reduced energy by up to 50% in our simulated workloads at maximum sequence length; (ii) multiplexing and assignment strategy yielded latency improvements exceeding 10x; and (iii) Optimizing for latency or energy resulted in distinct hardware mappings in our simulations. LightCode offers a module, foundational framework and simulator for compiling LLMs to emerging photonic accelerators.

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
We present an efficient algorithm for the all-electron periodic Coulomb matrix based on the Ewald summation combined with the Fourier-transformed Coulomb method. The short-range contributions involving compact densities are evaluated in real space using the standard Gaussian density fitting method. For the long-range contributions, we introduce an integral-direct planewave density fitting, applicable to both compact and diffuse densities. The resulting method achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups for prototypical solid-state systems compared to a closely related approach, the range-separated density fitting method. Using dispersion-corrected PBE functional and all-electron Dunning and Karlsruhe basis sets, we apply our method to compute the cohesive energy of the benzene crystal and the adsorption energy of CO on the MgO(001) surface. These results are in good agreement with existing literature. Our approach enables efficient Gaussian-based semi-local density functional calculations using dense $\mathbf {k}$-point meshes and traditional molecular Gaussian basis sets.

X-ray interferometry is an emerging imaging modality with a wide range of potential clinical applications, including lung and breast imaging, as well as non destructive testing in fields such as additive manufacturing and porosimetry. A grating interferometer uses a diffraction grating to produce a periodic interference pattern and measures how a patient or sample perturbs the pattern, producing three unique images that highlight X-ray absorption, refraction, and small angle scattering, known as the attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images. Image artifacts unique to X-ray interferometry are introduced when assuming the fringe pattern is perfectly sinusoidal and the phase steps are evenly spaced. Inaccuracies in grating position, coupled with multi-harmonic fringes, lead to Moire artifacts. We have developed an image recovery algorithm that estimates the true phase stepping positions using multiple harmonics and total variation regularization, removing the Moire artifacts present in the attenuation, differential phase, and dark-field images. We demonstrate the algorithm's utility for the Talbot-Lau and Modulated Phase Grating interferometers by imaging multiple samples, including PMMA microspheres and a euthanized mouse.

The growing energy demands of information and communication technologies, driven by data-intensive computing and the von Neumann bottleneck, underscore the need for energy-efficient alternatives. Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have emerged as promising candidates for beyond von Neumann computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic computing, offering voltage-history-dependent switching that mimics synaptic and neural behaviors. Atomic-scale mechanisms, such as defect-driven filament formation and ionic transport, govern these switching processes. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of Tantalum Oxide based RRAM devices featuring both oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient switching layers. We analyze the dominant conduction mechanisms underpinning resistive switching and systematically evaluate how oxygen stoichiometry influences device behavior. Leveraging a bottom-up design methodology, we link material composition to electrical performance metrics-such as endurance, cycle-to-cycle variability, and multilevel resistance states-providing actionable guidelines for optimizing RRAM architectures for energy-efficient memory and computing applications.

Data-Driven Reduced-Order Modeling of Phase Mixing Dynamics from Particle Kinetic Simulation

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Phase mixing is a fundamental kinetic process that governs dissipation and stability in collisionless plasmas, but its inherent filamentation in velocity space creates major challenges for both high-fidelity simulations and reduced-order modeling. This work presents the first exploratory evaluation of a joint Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (POD-SINDy) framework applied to particle-in-cell simulations of phase mixing. Simulation datasets were generated under progressively complex conditions, starting from a passive kinetic case without self-consistent electric fields, extending to self-consistent simulations with nonlinear electric field feedback, and finally to a noisy dataset with reduced particle resolution. In the passive kinetic regime, POD-SINDy achieved near-optimal reconstructions with only five modes, reproducing filamentation with errors below four percent. In self-consistent electrostatic cases, variance spread across more modes due to nonlinear interactions and noise, slowing singular value decay and making strict low-rank embeddings more demanding. Nevertheless, retaining ten modes was sufficient to recover the dominant structures, yielding reconstruction errors of about seven percent for the low-noise case and thirteen percent for the noisy dataset. Across all scenarios, SINDy provided sparse and interpretable equations for modal amplitudes that remained predominantly linear despite the underlying nonlinear data, while POD truncation effectively filtered particle noise and preserved coherent dynamics. These findings demonstrate that POD-SINDy constitutes a compact and interpretable approach to reduced-order modeling of phase mixing, capable of retaining essential physics across regimes of increasing complexity while achieving data compression from three to five orders of magnitude depending on dataset complexity.

Escalating urban heat, driven by the convergence of global warming and rapid urbanization, is a profound threat to billions of city dwellers. The science directing urban heat adaptation is strongly influenced by studies that use satellite-based land surface temperature (LST), which is readily available globally and address data gaps in cities, particularly in the Global South. LST, however, is a poor surrogate for near-surface air temperature, physiologically relevant human thermal comfort, or direct human heat exposure. This flawed practice leads to issues for several downstream use cases by inflating adaptation benefits, distorting the magnitude and variability of urban heat signals across scales, and thus misguiding urban adaptation policy. We argue that satellite-based LST must be treated as a distinct indicator of surface climate, which, though relevant to the urban surface energy budget, can be frequently decoupled from human-relevant thermal impacts especially during daytime. Only by a disciplined application of this variable, combined with complementary datasets, process-based and data-driven models, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration, can urban adaptation design and policy be effectively advanced.

We show that it is possible to locate the few places on the body of an airplane, while it is flying through high clouds, from which broad-band, pulsed, radiation is emitted at Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequencies. This serendipitous discovery was made whilst imaging a lightning flash using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). This observation provides insights into the way the airplane sheds the electrical charge it acquires when flying through clouds. Furthermore, this observation allowed us to test and improve the precision and accuracy for our lightning observation techniques.
Our new results indicate that with the improved procedure the location precision for strong pulses is better than 50~cm, with the orientation of linear polarization being accurate to within 25$^\circ$. For the present case of a Boeing 777-300ER, VHF emissions were observed exclusively associated with the two engines, as well as a specific spot on the tail. Despite the aircraft flying through clouds at an altitude of 8~km, we did not detect any emissions from electrostatic wicks.

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Atomistic Learning for "Clusters-to-Bulk" Generalization

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)
Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential, single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically, validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs.

Topology optimization of cathode gas channel layout in advanced proton exchange membrane fuel cells
Zahra Kazemi, Kamran Behdinan
Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) output relies on the transport behavior within the cathode gas channels. Current designs remain inadequate as they often rely on heuristic modifications of existing layouts or designer intuition with suboptimal performance. In this study, topology optimization is proposed to redesign the PEMFC cathode gas channel layout without a priori assumptions. The optimization aims to maximize the reactant concentration and minimize power dissipation along the flow path. The problem is solved within a three-dimensional half-cell model. For computational tractability, a reduced-order, depth-averaged two-dimensional model is also implemented. The optimized topology yields an enhanced current density with lower energy dissipation over the conventional benchmarks. At an inlet velocity of 0.15 m/s, the pressure drop is reduced by 46.7% compared to the serpentine layout, though is 28.2% higher than that of the parallel case. Within the optimized channels, oxygen flows at higher local velocities, which allows a more homogeneous reactant delivery across the domain. Relative to the serpentine layout, the improvement in mean current density reaches 20.9% with 4.9% lower standard deviation. Placing more emphasis on dissipation minimization during optimization produces more intricate, tortuous channel topologies. Such design flexibility enables the discovery of unconventional yet efficient layouts.

Optics (physics.optics)
The development of miniaturized spectrometers for cost-effective mobile applications remains challenging, as small footprints fundamentally degrade bandwidth and resolution. Typically, achieving high resolution necessitates extended and sophisticated optical paths for spectral decorrelation. These restrict bandwidth both physically (through resonant wavelength periodicity constraints) and mathematically (due to resulting ill-conditioned large matrix factorizations). Here, we report a spectrometer using a computational dispersion-engineered silicon photonic Vernier caliper. This deterministic design enables periodicity-suppressed orthogonal measurements by nature, thus overcoming the bandwidth-resolution-footprint limit of current chip-scale spectrometers. Leveraging the dispersion-engineered Vernier subwavelength grating microrings and factorization-free matrix computation, a spectral resolution of 1.4 pm is achieved throughout a bandwidth of >160 nm with a footprint of <55*35 {\mu}m2 in a single detection channel,establishing the highest bandwidth-to-resolution-to-footprint ratio (>57 {\mu}m-2) demonstrated to date. Furthermore, broadband densely overlapped molecular absorption spectra of hydrogen cyanide are precisely measured, resolving 49 R- and P-branch lines with linewidths ranging from 15 to 86 pm which is fundamentally challenging for compressive sensing approaches. Our chip-scale spectrometer provides a new path toward precise and real-time multi-species spectral analysis and facilitates their commercialization.

SPP-MIM hybridization meta-film: a biosensing structure uniting the merits of SPR and LSPR

11 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Having a flat device-solution interface is crucial for nanophotonic biosensors to achieve stable and reproducible performance, by mitigating solid-liquid-gas interfacial processes at the nanometer scale. In this aspect, the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) film presents a capable solution, by hybridizing surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and MIM gap plasmons, which is enabled by the latter's unique dispersion characteristic and wide tunability. In this meta-film, the SPPs propagate along a flat interface, and seal the gap plasmons which can be integrated with nanostructures, e.g., a coupling grating. In addition, by tuning the gap plasmons, the SPP-MIM hybridization meta-film can be designed to achieve a significantly reduced SPP evanescent depth and a significantly improved surface sensitivity. Using gold as the plasmonic material, such improvements are theoretically predicted across a broad spectral range, from visible to near infrared. Particularly, at 1550 nm, we show that a grating-coupled meta-film device is designed to have its evanescent depth shortened from 1.4 micrometers to 0.16 micrometers, with an enhancement factor of 5.6 in its surface sensitivity, as compared with traditional grating-coupled SPR. This unique characteristic of the SPP-MIM meta-film makes it an efficient combination of propagating SPR and LSPR, by simultaneously having a flat and simple biosensing interface, a short evanescent depth and a high surface sensitivity. It provides an inspiring approach for transforming various LSPR designs into stable biosensors.

A Deep-Learning-Driven Optimization-Based Inverse Solver for Accelerating the Marchenko Method
Ning Wang, Tariq Alkhalifah
Comments:
15 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
The Marchenko method is a powerful tool for reconstructing full-wavefield Green's functions using surface-recorded seismic data. These Green's functions can then be utilized to produce subsurface images that are not affected by artifacts caused by internal multiples. Despite its advantages, the method is computationally demanding, primarily due to the iterative nature of estimating the focusing functions, which links the Green's functions to the surface reflection response. To address this limitation, an optimization-based solver is proposed to estimate focusing functions in an efficient way. This is achieved by training a network to approximate the forward modeling problem on a small subset of pre-computed focusing function pairs, mapping final up-going focusing functions obtained via the conventional iterative scheme to their initial estimates. Once trained, the network is fixed and used as the forward operator within the Marchenko framework. For a given target location, an input is initialized and iteratively updated through backpropagation to minimize the mismatch between the output of the fixed network and the known initial up-going focusing function. The resulting estimate is then used to compute the corresponding down-going focusing function and the full Green's functions based on the Marchenko equations. This strategy significantly reduces the computational cost compared to the traditional Marchenko method based on conventional iterative scheme. Tests on a synthetic model, using only 0.8% of the total imaging points for training, show that the proposed approach accelerates the imaging process while maintaining relatively good imaging results, which is better than reverse time migration. Application to the Volve field data further demonstrates the method's robustness and practicality, highlighting its potential for efficient, large scale seismic imaging.

Photonic crystal cavities confine light to subwavelength volumes, enabling strong light-matter interactions for applications in low-power photonics, opto-electronics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information. These applications demand cavities that combine high quality factors, low mode volumes, and high coupling efficiencies. However, optimizing across these metrics requires exploring a large design space, motivating the use of inverse design strategies. Previous inverse design efforts targeted high quality factors and low mode volumes, sacrificing the coupling efficiency or lacking the ability to precisely control the far-field radiation pattern. In this work, we present an inverse design framework that simultaneously optimizes cavity quality factor and far-field numerical aperture, both specified as design targets. Using this method, we design L3 photonic crystal cavities, with different far-field numerical apertures, in the visible wavelength and fabricate them in silicon nitride. Photoluminescence measurements confirm experimental control of the far-field numerical aperture and reveal a 28-fold and 3.9-fold improvement in the coupling efficiency and quality factor respectively when compared to the standard L3 cavity. Disorder analysis further shows that the designs retain significant performance despite nanofabrication imperfections. Our work demonstrates a versatile inverse design framework for multi-objective optimization of photonic crystal cavities to attain high quality factors and coupling efficiency.

Tolerance of Phase Noise in Single-Carrier M-Ary QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications

Optics (physics.optics); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt 3{\sigma} error criterion that maps residual distortions onto the constellation, offering a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasizes the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators.

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
We combine modeling and experiments to investigate second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) in metal-indium tin oxide (ITO) metasurfaces. Linear optics at normal incidence show moderate field enhancement near the ITO epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) wavelength, steering the focus toward intrinsic, material driven nonlinear response rather than simple linear field boosting. Wavelength resolved SHG requires a Lorentz dispersive \chi^{2} for ITO to match spectra; a static \chi^{2} fails. Angle resolved SHG/THG cannot be reproduced with purely real coefficients; grouped contributions to \chi^{3} (and effective \chi^{2}) must be complex. Using a hydrodynamic model for the metal and ITO with linear dispersion plus dispersive \chi^{2} and \chi^{3}, we show that these complex phases arise from coherent interference of nonlinear sources in the metal, ITO, and interfaces, each weighted by distinct, complex local field and radiation factors. Experimentally, we fabricated split ring resonator metasurfaces on ITO films atop a metallic ground plate and measured linear reflectance and angle resolved SHG/THG in reflection geometry. The measurements quantitatively confirm the modeling: dispersive \chi^{2} is necessary to capture SHG spectra, and complex, interference induced effective coefficients are essential to reproduce angular SHG/THG patterns. Together, these results provide a unified, physically grounded interpretation of nonlinear emission from metal-oxide metasurfaces without relying on ENZ field enhancement.

Subjects:
Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Seismic wave generation creates labeled waveform datasets for source parameter inversion, subsurface analysis, and, notably, training artificial intelligence seismology models. Traditionally, seismic wave generation has been time-consuming, and artificial intelligence methods using Generative Adversarial Networks often struggle with authenticity and stability. This study presents the Seismic Wave Generator, a multi-conditional diffusion model with transformers. Diffusion models generate high-quality, diverse, and stable outputs with robust denoising capabilities. They offer superior theoretical foundations and greater control over the generation process compared to other models. Transformers excel in seismic wave processing by capturing long-range dependencies and spatial-temporal patterns, improving feature extraction and prediction accuracy compared to traditional models. To evaluate the realism of the generated waveforms, we trained downstream models on generated data and compared their performance with models trained on real seismic waveforms. The seismic phase-picking model trained on generative data achieved 99% recall and precision on real seismic waveforms. Furthermore, the magnitude estimation model reduced prediction bias from uneven training data. These findings suggest that diffusion-based generation models can address the challenge of limited regional labeled data and hold promise for bridging gaps in observational data in the future.

Underground lifelines, such as pipelines and tunnels, are susceptible to ground vibrations from seismic events, traffic, and other dynamic sources. Accurate prediction of their response is essential for ensuring structural safety and operability. This study introduces a semi-analytical model for transverse vibration analysis of buried lifelines, formulated using the Timoshenko beam theory on elastic foundation. The closed-form analytical solutions revealed that the vibration spectrum comprises four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. At each transition, the oscillatory characteristics of the modes change as a function of the system properties, leading to marked variations in dynamic amplification. The model's validity is confirmed through case studies of buried steel pipelines of varying lengths and operating conditions, showing excellent agreement with finite element simulations. A subsequent parametric study quantifies the influence of key factors - including soil stiffness and system length - on dynamic performance. The proposed method provides a computationally efficient and physically transparent framework for capturing complex vibration phenomena beyond simplified travelling-wave approaches, offering valuable guidance for the design and resilience assessment of underground lifeline systems subjected to various dynamic loads.

Machine learning meets Singular Optics II: Single-pixel Detection of Structured Light

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Structured light beams, including Laguerre-Gaussian (LG), Hermite-Gaussian (HG), and perfect vortex (PV) spatial modes, have been at the forefront of modern optics due to their potential in communications, metrology, and sensing. Traditional recognition methods often demand complex alignments and high-resolution imaging. Speckle-learned recognition (SLR) has emerged as a powerful alternative, exploiting the spatio-temporal speckle fields generated by light-diffuser interactions. This paper builds upon the earlier report: Machine Learning Meets Singular Optics (Proc. SPIE 12938, 2024), which demonstrated structured light recognition using 2D speckle images in both on-axis and off-axis channels captured in the spatial domain. In the present work, the recognition framework is advanced by employing 1D speckle information captured in the spatial and temporal domains. This paper reviews how the 2D spatial information of the structured light is mapped on 1D speckle arrays captured in space and 1D temporal speckle fluctuations recorded in time. The 1D speckle arrays captured in the spatial domain have successfully recognised the parent structured light beams with accuracy exceeding 94%, even by employing 1/nth of the 2D speckle data. More recently, 2D spatial information of structured light beams has been mapped onto temporal speckle sequences recorded by a single-pixel detector in the temporal domain. This study highlights the accuracy exceeding 96% across various structured light families, with resilience to turbulence and modal degeneracy. These advances establish scalable, alignment-free, and low-latency recognition architectures suitable for optical communication, sensing, and quantum technologies.

Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
High-fidelity ocean forecasting at high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-scale dynamical features, with profound implications for hazard prediction, maritime navigation, and sustainable ocean management. While conventional numerical models can generate sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they demand substantial computational resources and often struggle to maintain predictive skill at such fine scales. Data-driven models offer a promising alternative with significantly higher computational efficiency; however, most are constrained to daily outputs and show a rapid decay in accuracy when extended to sub-daily timescales. Here, we introduce TianHai, the first-of-its-kind global data-driven 6-hour forecasting model, which delivers predictions at 1/12° eddy-resolving resolution with a vertical extent down to 1,500 m. A key feature of TianHai is the integration of atmospheric forcings through FuXi-Atmosphere, a data-driven atmospheric forecasting system, which enables the explicit representation of air-sea coupling effects. Unlike conventional approaches, TianHai does not rely on numerical atmospheric models or external meteorological forecasts, making it a fully data-driven framework for coupled prediction. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that TianHai delivers state-of-the-art performance in forecasting temperature and salinity profiles, zonal and meridional currents, sea surface temperature, and sea level anomalies for lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days.

DeepEOSNet: Capturing the dependency on thermodynamic state in property prediction tasks

We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the dependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical) thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron, whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al. (2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies, with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure. Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally similar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be transferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a viable option for property prediction.

The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales.

Subsurface lithological heterogeneity presents challenges for traditional geophysical methods, particularly in resolving nonlinear electrical resistivity and induced polarization (IP) relationships. This study introduces a data-driven machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) framework for predicting 2D IP chargeability models from resistivity, depth, and station distance, reducing reliance on field IP surveys. The framework integrates ensemble regressors with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) enhanced by global average pooling. Among the tested models, CatBoost achieved the highest prediction accuracy (R^2 = 0.942 training, 0.945 testing), closely followed by random forest, while the stacked ML/DL ensemble further improved performance, particularly for complex resistivity-IP behaviors. Overall accuracy ranged from R^2 = 0.882 to 0.947 with RMSE < 0.04. Integration with k-means clustering enhanced lithological discrimination, effectively delineating sandy silt, silty sand, and weathered granite influenced by saturation, clay content, and fracturing. This scalable approach provides a rapid solution for subsurface modeling in exploration, geotechnical, and environmental applications.

We studied the reconstruction of turbulent flow fields from trajectory data recorded by actively migrating Lagrangian agents. We propose a deep learning model, Track-to-Flow (T2F), which employs a Vision Transformer as an encoder to capture the spatiotemporal features of a single agent trajectory, and a convolutional neural network as the decoder to reconstruct the flow field. To enhance the physical consistency of the T2F model, we further incorporate a physics-informed loss function inspired by the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), yielding a variant model referred to as T2F+PINN. We first evaluate both models in a laminar cylinder wake flow at a Reynolds number of $Re = 800$ as a proof-of-concept. The results show that the T2F model achieves velocity reconstruction accuracy comparable to existing flow reconstruction methods, while the T2F+PINN model reduces the normalized error in vorticity reconstruction relative to the T2F model. We then apply the models in a turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection at a Rayleigh number of $Ra = 10^{8}$ and a Prandtl number of $Pr = 0.71$. The results show that the T2F model accurately reconstructs both the velocity and temperature fields, whereas the T2F+PINN model further improves the reconstruction accuracy of gradient-related physical quantities, such as temperature gradients, vorticity, and the $Q$ value, with a maximum improvement of approximately 60\% compared to the T2F model. Overall, the T2F model is better suited for reconstructing primitive flow variables, while the T2F+PINN model provides advantages in reconstructing gradient-related quantities. Our models open a promising avenue for accurate flow reconstruction from a single Lagrangian trajectory.

Criticality of a stochastic modern Hopfield network model with exponential interaction function

The Hopfield network (HN) is a classical model of associative memory whose dynamics are closely related to the Ising spin system with 2-body interactions. Stored patterns are encoded as minima of an energy function shaped by a Hebbian learning rule, and retrieval corresponds to convergence towards these minima. Modern Hopfield Networks (MHNs) introduce p-body interactions among neurons with p greater than 2 and, more recently, also exponential interaction functions, which significantly improve network's storing and retrieval capacity. While the criticality of HNs and p-body MHNs were extensively studied since the 1980s, the investigation of critical behavior in exponential MHNs is still in its early stages. Here, we study a stochastic exponential MHN (SMHN) with a multiplicative salt-and-pepper noise. While taking the noise probability p as control parameter, the average overlap parameter Q and a diffusion scaling H are taken as order parameters. In particular, H is related to the time correlation features of the network, with H greater than 0.5 signaling the emergence of persistent time memory. We found the emergence of a critical transition in both Q and H, with the critical noise level weakly decreasing as the load N increases. Notably, for each load N, the diffusion scaling H highlights a transition between a sub- and a super-critical regime, both with short-range correlated dynamics. Conversely, the critical regime, which is found in the range of p around 0.23-0.3, displays a long-range correlated dynamics with highly persistent temporal memory marked by the high value H around 1.3.

Bilayer Cuprate Antiferromagnets Enable Programmable Cavity Optomagnonics
Tahereh Sadat Parvini
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Hybrid platforms that couple microwave photons to collective spin excitations offer promising routes for coherent information processing, yet conventional magnets face inherent trade-offs among coupling strength, coherence, and tunability. We demonstrate that bilayer cuprate antiferromagnets, exemplified by YBa2Cu3O6+x, provide an alternative approach enabled by their unique magnon spectrum. Using a neutron-constrained bilayer spin model, we obtain the complete Gamma-point spectrum and identify an in-plane acoustic alpha mode that remains gapless and Zeeman-linear, alongside an in-plane optical beta mode stabilized by weak anisotropy whose frequency can be tuned from the gigahertz to terahertz range. When coupled to a single-mode microwave cavity, these modes create two distinct channels with a magnetically tunable alpha-photon interaction and a nearly field-independent beta-photon interaction. This asymmetric behavior enables continuous, single-parameter control spanning from dispersive to strong coupling regimes. In the dispersive limit, our analysis reveals cavity-mediated magnon-magnon coupling, while near triple resonance the normal modes reorganize into bright and dark superpositions governed by a single collective energy scale. The calculated transmission exhibits vacuum-Rabi splittings, dispersive shifts, and Fano-like lineshapes that provide concrete experimental benchmarks and suggest potential for programmable filtering and coherent state transfer across the gigahertz-terahertz frequency range if realized experimentally with suitable interfaces.

Optics (physics.optics)
The combination of metasurfaces with chalcogenide phase-change materials is a highly promising route towards the development of multifunctional and reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. However, their transition into real-world devices is hindered by several technological challenges. This includes, amongst others, the lack of large area photonic architectures produced via scalable nanofabrication methods, as required for free-space photonic applications, along with the ability to withstand the high temperatures required for the phase-change process. In this work, we present a scalable nanofabrication strategy for the production of reconfigurable metasurfaces based on high-throughput, large-area nanoimprint lithography that is fully compatible with chalcogenide phase-change materials processing. Our approach involves the direct imprinting of high melting point, thermally stable TiO2 nanoparticle pastes, followed by the deposition of an Sb2Se3 thin film as the phase-change material active layer. The patterned titania film enables the creation of thermally robust metasurfaces, overcoming the limitations of conventional polymer-based nanoimprint approaches. The versatility of our approach is showcased by producing phase-change devices with two distinct functionalities: (i) metasurfaces with tunable spectral band switching and amplitude modulation capabilities across the near- to mid-infrared, and (ii) reconfigurable chiral metasurfaces, whose chiroptical activity can be switched between the visible and the near-infrared. Experimental results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations and reveal high uniformity across large areas.

Towards a unified turbulence model through multi-objective learning

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Turbulence is a central challenge in classical physics and a critical barrier to accurate flow prediction in climate, aerospace, and energy systems. Despite the widespread reliance on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers in industrial simulations, existing turbulence models lack the generalizability to handle diverse regimes, such as separation, secondary flows, and free-shear flows, without manual tuning or switching. We propose a unified data-driven turbulence modeling framework based on multi-objective learning. The goal is to achieve Pareto-optimal performance across heterogeneous flow datasets, each representing distinct mechanisms and quantities of interest. The resulting unified foundation model employs a parallel tensor basis neural network with automatic balancing and internal branching to adapt across flow regimes without explicit switching. The parallel architecture enables explicit regularization to promote model parsimony, while the tensor-basis formulation preserves physical symmetries. Trained on five representative flows, the model is evaluated on 27 test cases spanning attached, separated, and secondary flows, as well as two realistic three-dimensional flows of industrial relevance. It improves or matches the performance of the baseline $k$-$\omega$ model in all cases. For specific applications, we show that specialist models trained on tailored datasets can further improve accuracy in challenging configurations, such as three-dimensional diffuser flows common in gas turbine aerodynamics, which exhibit simultaneous separation and secondary flows. These results demonstrate that a generalized, deployable turbulence model unifying multiple flow mechanisms within a single architecture is achievable. This work marks significant progress toward unified turbulence modeling for scientific and industrial applications.

Models of growing networks are a central topic in network science. In these models, vertices are usually labeled by their arrival time, distinguishing even those node pairs whose structural roles are identical. In contrast, unlabeled networks encode only structure, so unlabeled growth rules must be defined in terms of structurally distinguishable outcomes; network symmetries therefore play a key role in unlabeled growth dynamics. Here, we introduce and study models of growing unlabeled trees, defined in analogy to widely-studied labeled growth models such as uniform and preferential attachment. We develop a theoretical formalism to analyze these trees via tracking their leaf-based statistics. We find that while many characteristics of labeled network growth are retained, numerous critical differences arise, caused primarily by symmetries among leaves in common neighborhoods. In particular, degree heterogeneity is enhanced, with the strength of this enhancement depending on details of growth dynamics: mild enhancement for uniform attachment, and extreme enhancement for preferential attachment. These results and the developed analytical formalism may be of interest beyond the setting of growing unlabeled trees.

Uranus and Neptune are the least explored planets in the Solar System. A key question regarding the two planets is the similarity of their observed flows despite the great differences in their obliquity and internal heating. To answer this fundamental question and understand the ice giants atmospheric circulation, we developed a new general circulation model (GCM). This tool will also be key to facilitating the success of future missions to the ice giants, for which atmospheric flows will be a measurable quantity. Past GCMs for the ice giants have struggled to reproduce the observed winds on Uranus and Neptune. Using our idealized GCM, we systematically explored how the zonal wind and meridional circulation respond to different model and physical parameters; our main focus was on the depth of the domain. We show that in cases where the bottom layer of the model is deep enough, the simulated flow is independent of the meridional structure of the forcing temperature, indicating that dynamical processes, and not the imposed thermal forcing, are the dominant drivers of the circulation and the thermal structure. A momentum balance analysis further shows that meridional and vertical eddy momentum flux convergence are both central to maintaining the circulation. These results provide a physical explanation for the similarity of the flow on Uranus and Neptune although their solar and internal forcing are significantly different. The modeling framework developed in this study can serve as a foundation for the development of more comprehensive GCMs of the ice giants and help guide the interpretation of future mission data.

A new jet gas target system has been developed for the Felsenkeller 5 MV underground ion accelerator for nuclear astrophysics. It provides either a 1.5$\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick cylindrical jet or a 7$\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ thick wall of nitrogen gas, with a surface of 10$\times$10 mm$^2$ to be seen by the ion beam. The system includes a de Laval type nozzle and altogether five pumping stages: In addition to the jet catcher and the jet chamber surrounding it, there are three stages connecting the jet to the ion accelerator. Behind the jet chamber, as seen from the ion beam, a windowless static-type gas target and, subsequently, a beam calorimeter have been installed.
This work describes the offline tests of the gas target system prior to its installation on the beam line of the Felsenkeller accelerator. The thickness of the jet has been determined using three different methods: By computational fluid dynamics simulations, with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and by $\alpha$-energy loss using a mixed $\alpha$ source. The three methods were shown to be in agreement. For 0-6 bar inlet gas pressure, a linear relationship between inlet pressure and jet thickness has been found. Different shapes of de Laval type inlet nozzles, both circular and slit-type, have been manufactured from fused silica glass or stainless steel and tested using measurements and simulations. The power and stability of the beam calorimeter have been tested. The interferometry has been shown to work reliably and to give two-dimensional projections of the gas jet with sub-mm resolution.

Strong light-matter coupling in Fabry-Perot cavities can modify ground-state molecular reactivity, charge and energy transport, while modifications to single-molecule properties have not been observed experimentally. The mechanisms and reproducibility of such effects remain contested, with conflicting theoretical predictions driven by differences in Hamiltonian choice and quantum state representation. Here, we resolve these ambiguities with numerically exact quantum simulations of cavity-coupled molecular ensembles based on the ab initio light-matter Hamiltonian, treating electrons, nuclei, and cavity photons on equal footing. We investigate ensembles of the rotational-vibrational-electronic Shin-Metiu model using variational tree-tensor-network quantum dynamics, capturing rovibronic couplings and anharmonicity. Embedding ensembles in a cavity induces local modifications of rotational, nuclear, and --more weakly-- electronic observables in individual molecules. The extent of these modifications depends only on the per-molecule coupling strength up until each molecule reaches the ultrastrong coupling regime, which remains unattainable in practical Fabry-Perot setups. Increasing ensemble size toward the thermodynamic limit causes these local modifications to vanish regardless of dipole self-energy inclusion. Nonetheless, global ground-state observables, such as light-matter coupling energy contributions (affecting overall polarizability) and cavity field displacement fluctuations, depend crucially on proper treatment of intermolecular and light-matter correlations, whereas intramolecular observables remain largely insensitive. These insights are crucial for guiding future investigations using approximate quantum treatments, and for the interpretation of experimental results in polaritonic chemistry.

Understanding the role of human behavior in shaping environmental outcomes is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change. Environmental systems are influenced not only by natural factors like temperature, but also by human decisions regarding mitigation efforts, which are often based on forecasts or predictions about future environmental conditions. Over time, different outcomes can emerge, including scenarios where the environment deteriorates despite efforts to mitigate, or where successful mitigation leads to environmental resilience. Additionally, fluctuations in the level of human participation in mitigation can occur, reflecting shifts in collective behavior. In this study, we consider a variety of human mitigation decisions, in addition to the feedback loop that is created by changes in human behavior because of environmental changes. While these outcomes are based on simplified models, they offer important insights into the dynamics of human decision-making and the factors that influence effective action in the context of environmental sustainability. This study aims to examine key social dynamics influencing society's response to a worsening climate. While others conclude that homophily prompts greater warming unconditionally, this model finds that homophily can prevent catastrophic effects given a poor initial environmental state. Assuming that poor countries have the resources to do so, a consensus in that class group to defect from the strategy of the rich group (who are generally incentivized to continue ``business as usual'') can frequently prevent the vegetation proportion from converging to 0.

Analysis of the Rarefied Flow at Micro-Step using a DeepONet Surrogate Model with a Physics-Guided Zonal Loss Function
Ehsan Roohi, Amirmehran Mahdavi
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method remains the gold standard for simulating rarefied gas flows but is prohibitively expensive for parametric and many-query applications. To address this limitation, we introduce a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) surrogate framework featuring an innovative, physics-guided zonal loss function. The zonal loss prioritizes physical fidelity in critical flow regions over global error metrics, leading to predictions with greater engineering relevance. It explicitly emphasizes accuracy in the recirculation zone, ensuring faithful reconstruction of separated flow features that are often under-resolved by conventional, globally averaged error metrics. Two operator-learning tasks are demonstrated: mapping the Knudsen number to the velocity field and mapping the step-height ratio to the flow solution. The results show excellent agreement with high-fidelity DSMC data. An ablation study highlights that, while global error metrics may suggest only marginal improvements, localized error analysis reveals the superior fidelity of the zonal loss in capturing vortex dynamics -- an aspect central to engineering relevance. The proposed surrogate reproduces detailed velocity fields with high physical fidelity and achieves predictions for unseen parameters in milliseconds, representing speedups of several orders of magnitude relative to DSMC. This capability enables the quantification of uncertainty, optimization, and design-space exploration that would otherwise be computationally intractable.

We present the first language-model-driven agentic artificial intelligence (AI) system to autonomously execute multi-stage physics experiments on a production synchrotron light source. Implemented at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator, the system translates natural language user prompts into structured execution plans that combine archive data retrieval, control-system channel resolution, automated script generation, controlled machine interaction, and analysis. In a representative machine physics task, we show that preparation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude relative to manual scripting even for a system expert, while operator-standard safety constraints were strictly upheld. Core architectural features, plan-first orchestration, bounded tool access, and dynamic capability selection, enable transparent, auditable execution with fully reproducible artifacts. These results establish a blueprint for the safe integration of agentic AI into accelerator experiments and demanding machine physics studies, as well as routine operations, with direct portability across accelerators worldwide and, more broadly, to other large-scale scientific infrastructures.

Magnetic equilibrium reconstruction is a crucial simulation capability for interpreting diagnostic measurements of experimental plasmas. Equilibrium reconstruction has mostly been applied to systems with isotropic pressure and relatively low plasma $\beta = 2\mu_0p/B^2$. This work extends nonlinear equilibrium reconstruction to high-$\beta$ plasmas with anisotropic pressure and applies it to the Wisconsin High Temperature Superconducting Axisymmetric Magnetic Mirror experiments to infer the presence of sloshing ions. A novel basis set for the plasma profiles and machine learning algorithm using scalable constrained Bayesian optimization allow accurate nonlinear reconstructions to be made more quickly with fewer experimental diagnostics and improves the robustness of reconstructions at high $\beta$. In addition to WHAM and other mirrors, such reconstruction techniques are potentially attractive in high-performance devices with constrained diagnostic capabilities such as fusion power plants.

Polarization control is of fundamental importance for modern optical systems, and optical polarizers serve as critical components for enabling this functionality. Here, we experimentally demonstrate optical polarizers by integrating 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films onto silicon photonic waveguides. High-quality monolayer MoS2 films with highly anisotropic light absorption are synthesized via a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) method and subsequently transferred onto silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowire waveguides to fabricate integrated optical polarizers. Detailed measurements are carried out for the fabricated devices with various MoS2 film coating lengths and silicon waveguide geometry. The results show that a maximum polarization-dependent loss of ~21 dB is achieved, together with a high figure of merit of ~4.2. In addition, the hybrid waveguide polarizers exhibit broad operation bandwidth exceeding ~100 nm and excellent power durability. These results highlight the strong potential for on-chip integration of 2D MoS2 films to implement high-performance polarization selective devices.

JPResUnet: A Joint Probability Density Function Translation Model in Partially Premixed Flames

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Machine learning (ML) models are often constrained by their limitations in extrapolation, which restricts their applicability in engineering contexts. Conversely, while exhibiting broad generality, many established scientific models seem to lack the necessary accuracy. This study addresses these challenges by introducing JPResUnet (Joint PDF Residual U-net), a novel model that integrates the strengths of both ML and traditional scientific approaches to predict sub-grid joint probability density functions (PDFs) in partially premixed flames. JPResUnet employs a residual U-Net architecture to translate classic $\beta$-PDFs to sub-grid PDFs. The model is trained using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data from methane-air moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion and is initially tested through a priori assessments on out-of-sample data. Comparative analyses against an artificial neural network (ANN) and the $\beta$-PDF approach demonstrate that JPResUnet consistently outperforms these methods in capturing complex sub-grid features with greater accuracy and robustness for both box and Gaussian kernels of varying widths, and for more extrapolated cases. Subsequent a posteriori assessment involves two versions of JPResUnet with different output PDF resolutions, which are deployed for large eddy simulation (LES) of a multi-regime burner through the look-up table (LUT) approach. The higher resolution model yields improvements in temperature estimates compared to the conventional LUT method. This highlights the potential of the JPResUnet model for robust and accurate LES of reacting flows with ML.

Transonic buffet presents time-dependent aerodynamic characteristics associated with shock, turbulent boundary layer, and their interactions. Despite strong nonlinearities and a large degree of freedom, there exists a dominant dynamic pattern of a buffet cycle, suggesting the low dimensionality of transonic buffet phenomena. This study seeks a low-dimensional representation of transonic airfoil buffet at a high Reynolds number with machine learning. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of flow over the OAT15A supercritical airfoil at two Mach numbers, $M_\infty = 0.715$ and 0.730, respectively producing non-buffet and buffet conditions, at a chord-based Reynolds number of $Re = 3\times 10^6$ are performed to generate the present datasets. We find that the low-dimensional nature of transonic airfoil buffet can be extracted as a sole three-dimensional latent representation through lift-augmented autoencoder compression. The current low-order representation not only describes the shock movement but also captures the moment when the separation occurs near the trailing edge in a low-order manner. We further show that it is possible to perform sensor-based reconstruction through the present low-dimensional expression while identifying the sensitivity with respect to aerodynamic responses. The present model trained at $Re = 3\times 10^6$ is lastly evaluated at the level of a real aircraft operation of $Re = 3\times 10^7$, exhibiting that the phase dynamics of lift is reasonably estimated from sparse sensors. The current study may provide a foundation toward data-driven real-time analysis of transonic buffet conditions under aircraft operation.

In this work, a theoretical scheme on quantum molecular dynamics in curved Schwarzschild spacetime is developed. To this end, the gravitational field is introduced by revising the kinetics energy operator (KEO) rather than by adding Newtonian gravitational interaction in the potential energy surface (PES) due to the important role of the metric tensor in deriving the KEO. To test the present Schr{ö}dinger-type framework, spherically symmetric Schwarzschild spacetime is chosen to explore (1) the H + H$_2$ reaction dynamics, (2) the H$_2$ + H$_2$ scattering dynamics, (3) dynamics of dissociative chemsorption of H$_2$O on Cu(111), and (4) the spectrum band of anthracene cation. Extensive numerical calculations in curved space predict that reaction or scattering probability and spectrum band decrease abruptly to zero as the gravitational strength increases, indicating the remarkable role of gravitational field in chemical dynamics and naturally leading to effects of gravitational time dilation of the molecular systems. However, it is noteworthy that moderate gravitational field can significantly enhance dynamical resonance in the low-energy region, if such resonance exists in flat space. Finally, based on the present numerical results discussions on the quantum molecular dynamics in curved space are given.

Beyond Fresnel Wave Surfaces: Off-Shell Photonic Density of States and Near-Fields in Isotropy-Broken Materials with Loss or Gain

Fresnel wave surfaces, or isofrequency light shells, provide a powerful framework for describing electromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic media, yet their applicability is restricted to reciprocal, lossless materials and far-field radiation. This paper extends the concept by incorporating near-field effects and non-Hermitian responses arising in media with loss, gain, or non-reciprocity. Using the Om-potential approach to macroscopic electromagnetism, we reinterpret near fields as off-shell electromagnetic modes, in analogy with off-shell states in quantum field theory. We show that photonic density of states (PDOS) distributions near Fresnel surfaces acquire Lorentzian broadening in non-reciprocal media, directly linking this effect to the Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law of exponential attenuation or amplification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how Abraham and Minkowski momenta, locked to light shells in the far field, naturally shift to characterize source structures in the near-field regime. This unified treatment bridges the gap between sources and radiation, on-shell and off-shell modes, and reciprocal and non-reciprocal responses. The framework provides both fundamental insight into structured light and practical tools for the design of emitters and metamaterial platforms relevant to emerging technologies such as 6G communications, photonic density-of-states engineering, and non-Hermitian photonics.

Design of Ultrathin Faraday Rotators based on All-dielectric Magneto-optical Metasurfaces at the Telecommunication Band

Optics (physics.optics)
Magneto-optical (MO) interactions offer a direct route to nonreciprocal optical devices but are intrinsically weak in the optical domain, posing a major challenge in downsizing MO functional devices. In this study, we present a design strategy for ultra-thin MO Faraday rotators based on all-dielectric metasurfaces supporting high-quality factor quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBIC) modes. Light trapping in QBIC modes induced by band folding significantly enhances MO interactions in a controllable manner, enabling a technologically relevant 45$^\circ$ Faraday rotation with a MO metasurface that is only a few hundred nanometers thick. The design also incorporates electromagnetically induced transparency via spectrally overlapping resonant modes to achieve high light transmittance reaching 80%. This approach not only enables compact yet practical MO Faraday rotator but also holds promises for advancing free-space magnetic sensors and MO modulators.

Frank Porter has recently posted a review of "Confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution" (arXiv:2509.02852). The long, diverse history of such intervals is closely related to that of confidence intervals for the parameter of the binomial distribution. While much of Porter's paper is enlightening and food for thought, I believe that his discussion of the intervals advocated by Gary Feldman and myself (FC) based on the likelihood ratio test (arXiv:physics/9711021) is flawed. The fundamental point of disagreement is whether or not the likelihood function exists in a part of parameter space where the statistical model does not exist. (The new paper says yes; FC say no.) Here, I focus mainly on that issue and the consequences, along with a few other remarks.

Modeling Interfacial Electron Transfer using Path Integral Molecular Dynamics

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Outer sphere electron transfer rates can be calculated from simulation data by sampling the equilibrium statistics of the canonical reaction coordinate -- the vertical energy gap. For these calculations, electron transfer is typically represented by an instantaneous change in the atomic partial charges. In this manuscript, we present an implementation of this procedure that utilizes an explicit path-integral representation of the transferring electron. We demonstrate our methodology by combining path integral molecular dynamics and Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory to calculate the rate of electron transfer from a Ferrocyanide complex to a gold electrode. We consider the dependence of this rate on electron transfer distance and applied potential. We find that when the electron is represented explicitly via path integral molecular dynamics, as opposed to implicitly via fixed atomic partial charges, the rates and thermodynamics are more consistent with experimental findings. We then apply our methodology to explore the role of bridging spectator cations in modifying electron transfer rates. We find, once again, that the path integral approach produces specific cation effects that are more consistent with experiment than those in which the transferring electron is represented implicitly.

Configuring clinical linear accelerators (linacs) for ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) electron experiments typically requires invasive hardware manipulation and/or irreversible manufacturer modifications, limiting broader implementation. We present an independently developed UHDR electron configuration of a clinical TrueBeam linac that allows reversible switching between preclinical UHDR and conventional (CONV) modes using only non-invasive software settings. UHDR mode was achieved via service mode software with RF and beam current settings typical of a photon beam, the photon target and monitor chamber retracted, and a clinically unused low-energy scattering foil inserted. An external AC current transformer (ACCT) for beam monitoring, anatomy-specific collimator, and sample holder were mounted on the accessory tray, with external ion chamber in solid water for exit dose monitoring. Percent depth dose (PDD) was measured for UHDR and CONV beams. Dose-per-pulse (DPP) was varied by adjusting gun voltage and quantified with radiochromic film at different source-to-surface distances (SSD). Beam profiles assessed dose uniformity and usable field size. Dose calibration was established between film, ACCT, and ion chamber, and day-to-day reproducibility was tested. PDD confirmed similar energies for UHDR (12.8MeV) and CONV (11.9MeV) beams with matching profiles through mouse thickness. Maximum DPP exceeded 0.5Gy, reaching ~1.5Gy for collimated in vivo setups and ~0.7Gy at extended SSD for tissue culture. Field flatness and symmetry were maintained, supporting organ-specific irradiations and up to 5cm fields for culture. Calibration showed strong linearity across detectors, and output variation was <4%. We demonstrated accurate, reproducible UHDR delivery on a widely available clinical linac with no invasive hardware manipulation, enabling preclinical FLASH research on a clinical treatment machine.

The silicon strip sensors of the Belle II silicon vertex detector were irradiated with 90 MeV electron beams up to an equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $3.0\times 10^{13}~{\rm n}_{\rm eq}/{\rm cm^2}$. We measure changes in sensor properties induced by radiation damage in the semiconductor bulk. Electrons around this energy are a major source of beam-induced background during Belle II operation. We discuss observed changes in full depletion voltage, sensor leakage current, noise, and charge collection. The sensor bulk type inverts at an equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $6.0\times 10^{12}~{\rm n}_{\rm eq}/{\rm cm^2}$. The leakage current increases proportionally to the radiation dose. We determine a damage constant of $3.9 \times 10^{-17}$ A/cm at 17 C$^\circ$ immediately after irradiation, which drops significantly to approximately 40% of the initial value in 200 hours, then stabilizes to approximately 30% of the initial value in 1000 hours. We measure sensor noise and signal charge for a sensor irradiated with the equivalent 1-MeV-neutron fluence of $3.0\times 10^{13}~{\rm n}_{\rm eq}/{\rm cm^2}$. Noise increases by approximately 44% after irradiation, while signal charge does not change significantly when a sufficiently high bias voltage is applied.

Charged liquid microdroplets have generated significant interest recently due to the observation of chemical reaction rate enhancement by orders of magnitude. Droplet charging by plasma irradiation has been observed along with significantly enhanced reactions in liquid. In this paper we measure the charge on fixed size (47 $\mu$m) individual droplets, exposed for approximately 4 ms to a low temperature RF-driven plasma operated at atmospheric pressure. The measured charge values (0.8--2.0 $\times 10^{7}$ electrons) approached the Rayleigh limit for the given droplet diameter. Results were compared with finite element simulations of plasma charging which provided estimates of surface electric fields and charge fluxes to the droplet surface and helps advance the development of a theoretical framework for plasma-charged microreactors.

To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.

Purpose: Pencil beam scanning proton therapy is sensitive to respiratory motion, leading to potential dose inhomogeneities due to interplay effects. We developed and validated a predictive framework to assess interplay and motion robustness in lung and esophageal cancer patients treated under free-breathing conditions. Methods: A synthetic-breathing-based predictive model was implemented in the RayStation treatment planning system (TPS) and validated against an in vivo approach using patient-specific respiratory traces and machine log files. Both were benchmarked against the Monte Carlo engine FRED. To demonstrate the methodology, the framework was applied to two clinical cases treated on the Mevion S250i system without rescanning. Dose accumulation incorporated respiratory phase, range ($\pm$3 %), and setup ($\pm$5 mm) uncertainties. Results: Excellent agreement was observed between TPS and FRED ($<$1 % mean dose difference) and between predictive and in vivo models ($<$2 % across DVH metrics). Cumulative dose distributions for the primary CTV converged after five fractions, confirming robust delivery. Conclusions: This automated, clinically integrated framework enables pre-treatment prediction and in vivo validation of interplay and motion robustness in PBS plans. Preliminary results support its clinical utility, especially for hypofractionation and targets with large motion ($>$2 cm). A larger cohort study is ongoing and will be reported separately.

Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Background: Accurate and fast dose calculation is essential for optimizing carbon ion therapy. Existing machine learning (ML) models have been developed for other radiotherapy modalities. They use patient data with uniform CT imaging properties. Purpose: This study investigates the application of several ML models for physical dose calculation in carbon ion therapy and compares their ability to generalize to CT data with varying resolutions. Among the models examined is a Diffusion Model, which is tested for the first time for the calculation of physical dose distributions. Methods: A dataset was generated using publicly available CT images of the head and neck region. Monoenergetic carbon ion beams were simulated at various initial energies using Geant4 simulation software. A U-Net architecture was developed for dose prediction based on distributions of material density in patients and of absorbed dose in water. It was trained as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generator, a Diffusion Model noise estimator, and as a standalone network. Their performances were compared with two models from literature. Results: All models produced dose distributions deviating by less than 2% from that obtained by a full Monte Carlo simulation, even for a patient not seen during training. Dose calculation time on a GPU was in the range of 3 ms to 15 s. The resource-efficient U-Net appears to perform comparably to the more computationally intensive GAN and Diffusion Model. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ML models can effectively balance accuracy and speed for physical dose calculation in carbon ion therapy. Using the computationally efficient U-Net can help conserve resources. The generalizability of the models to different CT image resolutions enables the use for different patients without extensive retraining.

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
We present a study of the ion stopping power due to free and bound electrons in a warm dense plasma. Our main goal is to propose a method of stopping-power calculation expected to be valid for any ionization degree. The free-electron contribution is described by the Maynard-Deutsch-Zimmerman formula and the bound-electron one relies on the Bethe formula with corrections, in particular taking into account density and shell effects. The impact of the bound-state computation by three different parametric potentials is investigated within the Garbet formalism for the mean excitation energy. The first parametric potential is due to Green, Sellin and Zachor, the second one was proposed by Yunta, and the third one was introduced by Klapisch in the framework of atomic-structure computations. The results are compared to the ones of self-consistent average-atom calculations. This approach correctly bridges the limits of neutral and fully-ionized matter.

In Nigeria, electoral behavior is often interpreted through ethno-religious views and regional allegiances, without empirically assessing the influence of socioeconomic indicators such as health, income, education, and other deprivations on voter behavior. This study investigates the voting pattern in the 2023 Nigerian presidential election and previous cycles using spatio-temporal and multivariate analysis. It examines whether support for some candidates was more substantial in states with higher Human Development Index (HDI) and whether this alignment impacts governance quality and macroeconomic performance post-election. Socioeconomic data were obtained from the Global Data Lab and the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the year preceding each election, while presidential vote results were sourced from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The results show that the Labour Party (LP) dominated states with high socioeconomic indices, accounting for about 30-53% of the variance in voting patterns of LP and People's Democratic Party (PDP), while the All Progressive Congress (APC) variance is less explained by these factors. Multinomial logits based on HDI is used to predict party win probabilities; the model predicted about 60% wins accurately. Comparative analysis of four presidential cycles revealed that in 2011, the winner had an HDI-vote correlation of 0.44, with improved macroeconomic indices post-election. In contrast, 2015, 2019, and 2023 saw negative correlations of -0.38, -0.43, and -0.34, respectively, alongside macroeconomic decline. The findings suggest that socioeconomic development shapes political preferences, promotes issue-based politics, and supports quality leadership; therefore, strengthening education, healthcare, and poverty reduction should be prioritized to enhance citizens' well-being and build an informed electorate.

High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.

Metalens, as the most promising and applicable emerging optical device, has long been constrained by the limited field of view (FOV). Recent studies employing phase engineering or multi-layer strategies have made some progress, but they all rely on upright meta-atoms. This leads us to consider whether tilted meta-atoms could represent a promising yet underexplored approach for enhancing the field of view? In this work, we introduce the control of the tilt angle of meta-atoms as a new degree of freedom into the design of metalenses and propose a wide-field-of-view (WFOV) metalens design framework utilizing radially gradient-tilted meta-atoms. Based on the proposed method, we designed two WFOV metalenses with distinct tilt configurations to meet specific application requirements of efficiency or precision. Simulation results demonstrate that both designs, exhibiting distinct performance characteristics, achieve diffraction-limited focusing within a 120 degree FOV. Additionally, the FOV can be expanded with this method by tuning the tilt angle configurations of meta-atoms and the metalens diameter. These findings will establish a promising pathway towards compact optical systems capable of combining ultra-wide angular coverage with high-resolution imaging.

Humid heat stress and heatwaves pose significant risks for living organisms, from humans and wildlife to insects, with wide-ranging health, ecological, and socio-economic impacts that are expected to worsen with climate change. How large-scale climate modes drive the week-to-month variability of humid heat remains poorly understood at the global scale, hindering accurate forecasts necessary for risk-management measures, notably in the heavily populated and ecologically fragile regions of the tropics and subtropics. With forecast lead times up to several weeks, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a global-scale intraseasonal tropical atmospheric wave circumnavigating Earth in around 30-60 days, provides considerable predictability for weather conditions, and meteorological and oceanic extremes. Here we show that the MJO, and the associated boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO), have a significant influence on humid heatwaves over much of the tropics and subtropics across all seasons, both over terrestrial and marine regions. Humid heatwave likelihood can double or halve, depending on the MJO phase, in large areas of the Earth. The MJO/BSISO's influence on wet-bulb temperature is primarily via specific humidity rather than dry-bulb temperature anomalies. We find that specific humidity anomalies are influenced by horizontal advection of moisture in the planetary boundary layer, particularly in the subtropics where advection of the climatological moisture gradient by MJO-related anomalous winds is the dominant term.

A cryogenic detector system based on two 3.3 kg high-purity CsI crystals was developed and characterized at approximately 95 K. Each wedge-shaped crystal was coupled to dual-ended 3-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for scintillation readout. The measured light yields were $28.7 \pm 0.9$ and $29.3 \pm 1.0$ photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (PE/keV$_{ee}$) for the two crystals, with corresponding energy resolutions of 7.2 \% and 7.7 \% (FWHM) at 59.6 keV. The detector demonstrated excellent spatial uniformity, low intrinsic radioactivity, and stable operation over a continuous one-month period. Optical photon simulations using Geant4 reproduced the observed light collection trends, providing guidance for detector optimization. These results establish cryogenic pure CsI as a scalable technology for low-threshold rare-event searches.

Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)
In wire-laser additive manufacturing (WLAM), producing parts with multiple entities requires optimizing both additive and subtractive processes. This involves adjusting positions and integrating machining operations. Geometric defects that occur during the components' deposition can affect subsequent entity production, making real-time measurement crucial. A contactless measuring system is essential to assess geometric deviations without complex post-processing. A comprehensive image stereocorrelation approach addresses this challenge. The produced geometry often has unaccounted features, such as rounded edges and corners. Superellipsoids serve as a versatile modeling tool for representing common geometries in WLAM and assessing dimensional and shape defects. Defined by three scale and two shape parameters, superellipsoids are introduced generally. This modeling tool is then combined with a global image correlation problem. The parameters defining this geometry are identified by minimizing the gray level difference between two images of a part. This approach is demonstrated in a case study, highlighting deviations in WLAM with a parameterized surface and paving the way for geometry updates in computer-aided manufacturing.

Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) is a promising technology for long-term orbit maintenance in very-low-Earth orbit. The intake device plays a crucial role in capturing and supplying propellant, and its capture efficiency is a key indicator of drag-compensation feasibility. For experimental evaluation, an electric-propulsion (EP) plasma plume can be used as a particle-flow generator to simulate the VLEO atmosphere in ground facilities. This study numerically investigates the interaction of an EP plasma plume with an intake device to establish guidelines for measuring capture efficiency in conventional vacuum facilities. A hybrid PIC-DSMC method with ion-surface interaction models is employed to simulate the plasma plume incident on the intake. The composition of the captured flow is governed by beam-ion energy and species mass: lowering the energy and using lighter atmospheric constituents increase plume divergence and promote neutralization, yielding a neutral-dominated outlet flow. Sputtering of the intake surface becomes non-negligible at high energies but can be mitigated by operating at appropriately low beam energies. The results show that simultaneous ion and neutral diagnostics are required for reliable capture-efficiency evaluation when using EP plasma plumes in ground facilities.

Machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models have demonstrated remarkable potential in delivering accurate forecasts at significantly reduced computational cost compared to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. However, challenges remain in ensuring the physical consistency of MLWP outputs, particularly in deterministic settings. This study presents FastNet, a graph neural network (GNN)-based global prediction model, and investigates the impact of alternative loss function designs on improving the physical realism of its forecasts. We explore three key modifications to the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss: (1) a modified spherical harmonic (MSH) loss that penalises spectral amplitude errors to reduce blurring and enhance small-scale structure retention; (2) inclusion of horizontal gradient terms in the loss to suppress non-physical artefacts; and (3) an alternative wind representation that decouples speed and direction to better capture extreme wind events. Results show that while the MSH and gradient-based losses \textit{alone} may slightly degrade RMSE scores, when trained in combination the model exhibits very similar MSE performance to an MSE-trained model while at the same time significantly improving spectral fidelity and physical consistency. The alternative wind representation further improves wind speed accuracy and reduces directional bias. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of loss function design as a mechanism for embedding domain knowledge into MLWP models and advancing their operational readiness.

Conventional femtosecond coherent laser spectroscopy predominantly focuses on the temporal phase coherence through time- or frequency-resolved methods. In this work, we suggest an alternative experimental framework based on spatial phase coherence. The intrinsic spectral dispersion of wavevectors in femtosecond pulses and sample dimensions exceeding the laser wavelength create a compelling basis to establish spatial phase coherence as a novel and robust foundation for femtosecond laser spectroscopy. Using rotational Raman coherence in gas molecules as a case study, we analyze the transverse spatial distribution of the third-order signal generated by a rotational wave-packet. Our findings reveal apparent temporal shifts and distortions in time-resolved signals that arise in conventional measurements lacking sensitivity to spatial phase coherence. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial phase coherence can serve as a useful tool for thermometric applications, showcasing its sensitivity to temperature variations. These discoveries open new avenues in femtosecond laser spectroscopy, including an alternative single-shot detection scheme, a new form of Raman coherence imaging and molecular species quantification during overlapping fractional revivals.

To reduce computation times of simulations involving gas fueled internal combustion engines (ICEs), a model is developed that determines non-ideal nozzle exit conditions to spare expensive simulations of internal injector flows. The model, to which we will refer as the Global Conservation Model (GCM), computes nozzle exit values based on reservoir conditions, and a discharge and momentum coefficient. These coefficients can be obtained via common flow bench experiments or a validated numerical simulation setup. Furthermore, it allows to use real gas thermodynamics which is often needed for ICE applications. The model is validated for three commonly used injector types, injection pressures up to 300 bar, subsonic and choked injections, and at flow bench and engine conditions using numerical simulations. If real gas thermodynamics is applied, differences with the simulated nozzle conditions are typically within 1.5% uncertainty, which is within the typical range of experimental momentum flow measurements found in literature. Differences in mass and momentum flow obtained by the numerical simulations between flow bench and engine conditions are negligible, indicating that flow bench measurements can be applied to engine conditions. Once an injector is characterized for mass and momentum flow, applying the GCM can reduce computation times by more than a factor 8, while accurately simulating the spatial and temporal jet development. With the reduction in computation time, the GCM reduces costs associated with numerical simulations and accelerates research and design of efficient and low-emission gas fueled ICEs.

A dedicated experiment FEDORA (Fusion Experiment for Divertor Optimization Research Applications) has been constructed to visualize flow boiling at scaled fusion divertor conditions. Its main purpose is to obtain the information on local boiling parameters, needed for the development of mechanistic boiling models in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. Current boiling models, although grounded on realistic physical principles, still rely heavily on empirical correlations, particularly for boiling parameters such as nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter, and bubble departure frequency. Due to the harsh operating conditions in the water-cooled divertor plasma-facing components (high heat fluxes over 10 MW/m 2 , mean flow velocity of about 9 m/s), visualization of boiling in realistic cooling channels is not feasible. The proposed experiment addresses this challenge by employing a surrogate coolant, characterized by lower latent heat and saturation temperature. By analyzing key dimensionless numbers, the aim is to replicate boiling conditions to be similar to those in coolant channels of upcoming divertor designs. Distinctive features of the proposed experimental setup include visually transparent boiling channel, infra-red transparent window and a thin electrically heated foil. This setup allows simultaneous high-speed and high-resolution recording of boiling phenomena in the flow and measurement of temperature distribution on the heated surface. In this work, the design, similarity analysis and the first measurement results are presented, proving the concept of the visualization approach to understand the boiling heat transfer in divertor cooling channels.

The ability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to predict flow boiling at high heat flux and high flow velocity conditions has been investigated. High heat fluxes of about 10 MW/m 2 and high flow velocities of about 10 m/s typically appear in water cooling channels of divertor target elements in fusion reactors. In particular, the heat flux partitioning model used in the two-fluid CFD formulation was studied. CFD simulations of flow boiling in realistic divertor target cooling channels were performed and compared with conservative single-phase simulations. The predictive capability of CFD models for boiling was evaluated using experimental data, covering a wide range of flow velocities and heat fluxes. Existing CFD models correctly predicted void fraction and wall temperature at low flow velocities, but showed physically irrelevant results at higher velocities (above 3 m/s) leading to wall temperature overestimation. The study identified the wall heat flux partitioning model as the main contributor to the mispredictions and thoroughly discussed the main modelling shortcomings. By analysing the impact of operating conditions, some key boiling parameters, and state-of-the-art heat flux partitioning models, improvements of the model parameters are proposed. The simulations and model analyses are performed within the framework of the ANSYS CFX code and the results are compared with flow boiling experiments in uniformly and top-heated flow channels.

Real-time data processing of the next generation of experiments at FAIR requires reliable event reconstruction and thus depends heavily on in-situ calibration procedures. Previously, we developed a neural-network-based approach that predicts calibration parameters from continuously available environmental and operational data and validated it on the HADES Multiwire Drift Chambers (MDCs), achieving fast predictions as accurate as offline calibrations. In this work, we introduce several methodological improvements that enhance both accuracy and the ability to adapt to new data. These include changes to the input features, better offline calibration and trainable normalizations. Furthermore, by combining beam-time and cosmic-ray datasets, we demonstrate that the learned dependencies can be transferred between very different data-taking scenarios. This enables the network not only to provide real-time calibration predictions, but also to infer optimal high-voltage settings, thus establishing a practical framework for a real-time detector control during data acquisition process.

We present FastNet version 1.0, a data-driven medium range numerical weather prediction (NWP) model based on a Graph Neural Network architecture, developed jointly between the Alan Turing Institute and the Met Office. FastNet uses an encode-process-decode structure to produce deterministic global weather predictions out to 10 days. The architecture is independent of spatial resolution and we have trained models at 1$^{\circ}$ and 0.25$^{\circ}$ resolution, with a six hour time step. FastNet uses a multi-level mesh in the processor, which is able to capture both short-range and long-range patterns in the spatial structure of the atmosphere. The model is pre-trained on ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis data and then fine-tuned on additional autoregressive rollout steps, which improves accuracy over longer time horizons. We evaluate the model performance at 1.5$^{\circ}$ resolution using 2022 as a hold-out year and compare with the Met Office Global Model, finding that FastNet surpasses the skill of the current Met Office Global Model NWP system using a variety of evaluation metrics on a number of atmospheric variables. Our results show that both our 1$^{\circ}$ and 0.25$^{\circ}$ FastNet models outperform the current Global Model and produce results with predictive skill approaching those of other data-driven models trained on 0.25$^{\circ}$ ERA5.

One of the current trends of laser applications in material science is using high-intensity lasers to provide fast and efficient surface or volume modifications for achieving controllable material properties, synthesis of novel materials with desired functionalities, and upscaling laser technologies with industry-demanded throughputs. Depending on the parameters, lasers can offer versatile solutions for scientific and industrial applications, starting from exploring the fundamental physics of warm dense matter and molecular chemistry at ultrashort timescales to large-scale fabrication of surfaces with anti-bacterial, tribological, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic properties. The objectives of this Chapter are to provide a review of recent advancements in several laser application fields, which involve high-intensity lasers, both ultrashort (femto- and picosecond) and short (nanosecond). After summarizing general trends in high-intensity laser processing of materials, we will first focus on the new opportunities offered by high-intensity lasers for the controlled synthesis of multielement nanoparticles for catalytic and theranostic applications. Then, the blister-based laser-induced forward transfer (BB-LIFT) technique will be presented, allowing a one-step, high-precision printing of nanomaterials on any substrates. The next section will discuss the selective crystallization of amorphous (as prepared) semiconductor nanoscale materials. The processes enabling high selectivity of crystallization into the desired phase using ultrashort powerful lasers will be analyzed. After that, opportunities for using high-power lasers will be discussed for upscaling surface nanostructuring with high throughput for bio-medical and industrial applications. Finally, an introduction to the Open Access program of the HiLASE Centre, which is targeted at offering users high-intensity beam time, will be given.

Optics (physics.optics)
The ranges of existence and stability of dark cavity-soliton stationary states in a Fabry-Perot resonator with a Kerr nonlinear medium, vectorial polarization components and normal dispersion are determined. The Fabry-Perot configuration introduces nonlocal coupling that shifts the cavity detuning by the round trip average power of the intracavity field. When compared with ring resonators, nonlocal coupling leads to strongly detuned dark cavity solitons that exist over a wide range of detunings. We study symmetry breaking between fields of opposite circular polarization characterized by a codimension-2 bifurcation point unique to the regime of normal group velocity dispersion. We show the spontaneous formation of regular dark soliton crystals separated by Turing patterns of alternating polarization via "self crystallization" due to long range interactions. Frequency combs of dark soliton crystals of two orthogonal polarizations in Fabry-Perot resonators display three separate components corresponding to the cavity repetition rate, the wavelength of the periodic pattern and the soliton lattice spacing. The system also displays the formation of stationary and dynamical vectorial dark-bright solitons. These solutions are different from previous realizations with bichromatic driving in ring resonators, are composed of locked switching fronts and can undergo Hopf bifurcations when scanning the detuning. Interacting oscillating dark-bright solitons display anti-phase dynamics that changes first into quasi-periodic oscillations and then into in-phase dynamics when increasing the cavity length.

Phase singularities are universal features found across diverse wave systems. Their ensembles exhibit distance correlations governing exotic material phases. However, the full correlations in phase-space have remained unexplored and experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly measure the ultrafast dynamics of optical singularity ensembles, capturing their phase-space correlations. Our observations reveal that phase singularities exhibit acceleration to unbounded velocities before annihilation, indicated by measurements of velocities exceeding the speed of light. These superluminal velocities are paradoxically amplified by the slow group velocity of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in our material platform, hexagonal boron nitride membranes. We demonstrate these phenomena using combined hardware and algorithmic advances in ultrafast electron microscopy, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions each an order of magnitude below the polaritonic wavelength and cycle period. Our findings enable probing topological defect dynamics at previously unattainable timescales, deepening our understanding of phase-singularity universality and suggesting phenomena of ultrafast information flow in polaritonic media.

Validation of the Following Streamer mechanism for SF6 breakdown induced by floating linear metal particles

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
A recently proposed Following Streamer mechanism (Feng et al. 2025 Phys. Rev. Applied 23 064039) seeks to explain how floating metal particles induce SF6 streamer breakdown in the combined gap. This mechanism is derived from a 2D axisymmetric fluid model, which has limitations in describing multiple streamer events in real-world 3D scenarios. To validate the Following Streamer mechanism, we experimentally investigate the discharge morphology of SF6 streamers induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative pulsed voltage. The results are then compared with those from 2D axisymmetric fluid simulations. The comparison reveals both consistencies and discrepancies. Regarding consistencies, experimentally observed features-such as streamer inception at both ends of the metal particle and the formation of subsequent following streamers-support the general idea of the Following Streamer mechanism. Regarding discrepancies, the experiments show a larger number of following streamers and off-axis propagation paths, which cannot be described in the 2D simulation. For scientific rigor, an extended physical model was proposed to improve the description of the Following Streamer mechanism.

The exchange of protons and deuterons is a very fast process, even on macroscopic length scales. Here we directly measure quantitatively the formation of HDO within the first 100 microseconds of the reaction at the liquid-liquid interface between D$_2$O and H$_2$O using a fast-flowing liquid flat jet and infrared spectroscopic imaging. During early stages of the reaction, the rate of HDO formation is limited by the availability of hydroxide and hydronium ions mediating the reaction, rather than simply by diffusion. This reveals a non-equilibrium state of the interface, being fully mixed diffusely yet with HDO concentrations well below equilibrium. We extract the reaction rate constant for the HDO formation in good agreement with picosecond timescales of the elementary proton-deuteron exchange reaction. Quantitative analysis of educt and product concentrations by infrared imaging at well-defined liquid-liquid interfaces as introduced here will enable studying fast kinetics for a wide range of chemical reactions.

The present work compares results for different numerical methods in search of alternatives to improve the quality of large-eddy simulations for the problem of supersonic turbulent jet flows. Previous work has analyzed supersonic jet flows using a second-order, finite difference solver based on structured meshes, and the results indicated a shorter potential core of the jet and different levels of velocity fluctuations. In the present work, the results of previous simulations are compared to new results using a high-order, discontinuous Galerkin solver for unstructured meshes. All simulations are performed keeping the total number of degrees of freedom constant. The results of the current simulations present very similar mean velocity distributions and slightly smaller velocity fluctuations, and they seem to correlate better with the experimental data. The present results indicate that additional studies should focus on the jet inlet boundary conditions in order to improve the physical representation of the early stages of the jet development.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The present work evaluates the effects of three inflow boundary conditions on large-eddy simulations of supersonic jet flows. The three inlet flow configurations considered are an inviscid profile, a stationary turbulent profile extracted from a RANS calculation, and a time-dependent tripped turbulent profile. The study applies the nodal discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization to perform the supersonic jet flow simulations. Initially, a mesh and polynomial resolution study is performed to identify the requisites for simulating the supersonic jet flow. The velocity profiles resulting from the three numerical simulations with the different inflow conditions are compared with experimental data. The velocity profiles extracted from the calculation results indicate a major role of the steady turbulent inlet profile on the jet flow behavior, even for the tripped inlet condition. The imposition of a steady turbulent inlet profile could approximate the velocity distributions in the region close to the jet inlet section with the experimental reference. Negligible changes were observed to the velocity profiles far from the inlet section, where a good agreement with the experimental reference was already obtained from the simulations even with the inviscid profile.

The effects of adiabatic and isothermal boundary conditions are investigated on the shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) in a supersonic turbine cascade. Special attention is given to the characterization of the incoming boundary layers over the convex and concave walls of the blade and their impact in the SBLIs. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed for an inlet Mach number of $\mathbf{M_\infty = 2.0}$ and Reynolds number based on the axial chord $\mathbf{Re = 200\,000}$. For the isothermal condition, the wall to inlet temperature ratio is $\mathbf{T_w/T_{\infty}=0.75}$, representing a cooled wall. Different incident shock wave topologies occur on the suction and pressure sides of the airfoil. For the former, an oblique shock impinges on the boundary layer leading to a larger separation bubble. On the other hand, a normal shock from a Mach reflection induces a small separation region near the wall for the pressure side. Results are presented in terms of mean velocity and temperature contours, and the incoming boundary layers are characterized by looking at the Clauser parameter, shape factor, dilatation and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles. Inspection of the shape factors show that the adiabatic wall boundary layers are more prone to separate than the isothermal ones. This is indeed observed in the airfoil suction side, but not on the pressure side, where the flow separates in the same chord position regardless of the thermal boundary condition. This is a topic for investigation in the final version of the paper. An assessment of the dilatation and TKE profiles explains the disparities of the bubble sizes on the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil.

Bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) is an intense quantum state of light with zero mean electric field and huge photon number fluctuations, sufficiently intense to drive extreme nonlinear processes and imprint nonclassical statistics. However, the temporal structure of single BSV shots has not been fully characterized. Here, we retrieve the spectral and temporal pulse characteristics of a set of single-peak BSV shots. It is obtained by realizing a femtosecond BSV source at 1040 nm with a single spatial mode and perform single-shot spectral interferometry with a fully characterized coherent-state reference pulse. Our approach reveals that the group delay is consistent between the various shots, resulting in an average pulse duration of 27.2 fs, much shorter than the pump pulse, and a variation of 5.5 fs (standard deviation). We also observe a characteristic nodal structure in the spectral interferograms, demonstrating the BSV's random phase ambiguity of $\pi$ rad. Our approach demonstrates that BSV is a viable source of femtosecond light pulses for attosecond sub-cycle metrology of ultrafast electron dynamics.

Subjects:

Objective: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides a low-dose imaging alternative to conventional CT, but suffers from noise, scatter, and artifacts that degrade image quality. Synthetic CT (sCT) aims to translate CBCT to high-quality CT-like images for improved anatomical accuracy and dosimetric precision. Although deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often face limitations in generalizability and detail preservation. Conditional diffusion models (CDMs), with their iterative refinement process, offers a novel solution. This review systematically examines the use of CDMs for CBCT-to-sCT synthesis.
Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Inclusion criteria targeted works employing conditional diffusion models specifically for sCT generation. Eleven relevant studies were identified and analyzed to address three questions: (1) What conditional diffusion methods are used? (2) How do they compare to conventional deep learning in accuracy? (3) What are their clinical implications?
Results: CDMs incorporating anatomical priors and spatial-frequency features demonstrated improved structural preservation and noise robustness. Energy-guided and hybrid latent models enabled enhanced dosimetric accuracy and personalized image synthesis. Across studies, CDMs consistently outperformed traditional deep learning models in noise suppression and artefact reduction, especially in challenging cases like lung imaging and dual-energy CT.
Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models show strong potential for generalized, accurate sCT generation from CBCT. However, clinical adoption remains limited. Future work should focus on scalability, real-time inference, and integration with multi-modal imaging to enhance clinical relevance.

Single image sensorless adaptive optics for microscopy

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Images obtained by microscopes are generally degraded by aberrations. Adaptive optics (AO) has been widely used in to compensate for aberrations and improve reduced image quality. Requiring no separate wavefront sensor, sensorless AO methods deduce the aberrations from a sequence of images acquired with different phase modulations. Despite that these methods are versatile and flexible, they involve sequential acquisition of multiple images thus time-consuming to implement. Here, we propose a new sensorless AO method based on only a single image. Experimental results on a two-photon fluorescence microscope showed that our method achieved distinct correction while imaging different types of structures under various noise levels with each correction loop taking less than 1 second. This work has significantly accelerated sensorless AO, which will assist its application in many challenging imaging scenarios of microscopy.

First-principles simulations of DNA damage, repair, and multicellular responses are crucial for understanding therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. The integration of these models into personalized, digital twin frameworks promises transformative clinical applications, but progress depends on deep mechanistic insights, experimental validation, and balancing model complexity with practicality for clinical use.

We report on a Nb$_3$Sn-coated low-beta superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity intended for accelerating ions. We aim to apply the cavity in ATLAS, our Argonne National Laboratory user facility for nuclear physics studies with ion beams in the energy range of 5-20 MeV/u. The Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, a 145 MHz quarter-wave optimized for ions moving with velocity $\beta$=v/c=0.08 exhibits an order-of-magnitude reduction in radiofrequency (RF) losses into helium at $4.4\,\mathrm{K}$ compared to a superconducting niobium (Nb) cavity at the same frequency and temperature. Experimentally measured fields are among the highest to date for any Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, reaching to the peak surface magnetic field of 105 mT. We also present a practical solution to the problem of cavity frequency tuning. Tuning by mechanical deformation has been a challenge with Nb$_3$Sn due to its brittle nature, however, using a set of techniques tailored to the properties of thin-film Nb$_3$Sn on Nb, we can repeatably tune the cavity to the ATLAS master clock frequency after it is cooled, while maintaining the excellent performance characteristics. The same Nb$_3$Sn cavity technology offers broad benefits for future ion accelerators.

Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior

Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Excited-state methods within the nuclear--electronic orbital (NEO) framework have the potential to capture vibrational, electronic, and vibronic transitions in a single calculation. In the NEO approach, specified nuclei, typically protons, are treated quantum mechanically at the same level of theory as the electrons. Affordable excited-state NEO methods such as time-dependent density functional theory are limited to capturing the subset of excitations with single-excitation character, whereas existing methods that capture the full spectrum are limited in applicability due to their high computational cost. Herein, we introduce the excited-state variant of NEO coupled cluster with approximate second-order doubles (NEO-CC2) and its scaled-opposite-spin variant with electron-proton correlation scaling (NEO-SOS'-CC2). We benchmark this method for positronium hydride, where the electrons and positron are treated quantum mechanically, and find that NEO-CC2 deviates from exact results, but NEO-SOS'-CC2 can achieve near-quantitative accuracy by increasing the electron-positron correlation. Benchmarking NEO-CC2 and NEO-SOS'-CC2 on four different triatomic molecules with a quantum proton, we find that NEO-CC2 captures the correct vibrational features such as overtones and combination bands, as well as mixed electron-proton double excitations. Electron-proton correlation scaling that increases the excited-state correlation relative to the ground-state correlation improves the accuracy across all the molecular systems tested. NEO-SOS'-CC2 can describe single and mixed protonic and electronic excitations with accuracy approaching that of much more computationally intensive methods.

A self-consistent saturation model for the prediction of aeroacoustic limit cycles emerging in turbulent low-Mach cavity flows (Re=O(10^5), M\simeq 0.2) is proposed. It predicts the nonlinear interactions between the acoustic modes of a deep rectangular cavity and the hydrodynamic instabilities of the turbulent shear-layer that forms over its opening due to the presence of a grazing flow. The model is based on the triple decomposition of the flow variables and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. At each step of the iterative process, the nonlinear eigenvalue problem associated to perturbations around the mean flow is updated with the steady component of the forcing from the unstable eigenmode's Reynolds stress. The iterations are performed until the dominant eigenmode becomes marginally stable, i.e. its growth rate vanishes. The evolution of the coherent velocity fluctuations as function of the oscillation amplitude is in good qualitative agreement with previously published compressible Large Eddy Simulations. Furthermore, the predictions of the frequency and amplitude of the aeroacoustic limit cycle oscillations are validated against the ones obtained from a low order model, whose parameters were adjusted to reproduce the experimental measurements of the deep cavity whistling.

Originally envisioned as a solution for the capacity crunch in telecommunications networks, multicore fibers (MCF) are contributing to scientific fields beyond telecom, such as sensing and metrology. Confined within the same cladding, the cores of MCF have a high degree of noise correlation which can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Here, we investigate MCF as a solution to the challenging problem of quantum and classical light co-existence in quantum networks by operating the quantum and stabilization light in separate but highly correlated cores of a 7-core MCF. Over 40 km of spooled fiber, we achieved 100 attosecond integrated jitter on one core by using phase information derived from another core. This allows for 100% duty cycle on a quantum channel while maintaining a low spurious photon rate from crosstalk between stabilization and quantum channels. With cycle-slip-free stabilization over 6 hours, frequency detuning between designated stabilization and quantum channels, and an additional 40 dB rejection of noise photons provided by the low optical crosstalk between cores, we achieved a Raman scattering-induced spurious photon rate of only 0.01 photons/s in 100 GHz bandwidth. Our results with MCF are a promising approach to ultra-stable quantum networks with 100% duty cycle on the quantum channel.

This study constructs a hybrid module with a multi-material collaborative detection architecture by integrating silicon pixel layers into the longitudinally segmented scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter module and optimizes the placement of the silicon layers. The module utilizes the pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56\% for position resolution and 26\% for time resolution, respectively. These advancements also lead to significant increase of physics sensitivity, especially for physics channels with low-energy photons, for instance, a 16\% boost in signal significance for $D^{*0}$ from the $B^-\rightarrow D^{*0}(\rightarrow D^0 \gamma)\pi^-$ decay

A Novel Chiroptical Spectroscopy Technique

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Chiral objects typically exhibit a different extinction for the two circular polarizations of light. Researchers often detect the chirality of objects by measuring this extinction difference employing Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In this Letter, we present a new spectroscopy technique for detecting the chirality of spherical objects based on measuring the Stokes parameters at any non-forward angle. The chirality measure we introduce effectively eliminates achiral background noise and is independent of both the object's concentration and the optical path length. Notably, when a solution contains both enantiomers of a chiral object, our method can discern which enantiomer predominates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the technique is robust and verifiable in-situ by measuring the Stokes vector at two different non-forward angles of choice.

Future space-ground communication networks require a seamless fusion of technologies that combine the all-weather reliability of microwave links with the ultra-high data capacity of near-infrared optical systems. Achieving this vision demands compact, robust, and multifunctional hardware, yet monolithic integration of these fundamentally distinct domains has remained elusive. Here, we present the first monolithically integrated silicon photonic chip that bridges microwave and optical domains for dual-band free-space communications and dynamic beamforming. The chip integrates a microwave true time delay (TTD) beamforming network, an optical phased array (OPA) beamforming network, and an optical coherent transceiver, all on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. By uniting the strengths of microwave resilience, optical bandwidth, and coherent detection sensitivity, this photonic integrated circuit represents a critical step toward reconfigurable, interference-resistant, high-throughput links for satellites, UAVs, and ground stations. Experimental demonstrations confirm two-dimensional dynamic beam steering in both bands 24.9 deg x 18.5 deg at microwave frequencies and 10 deg x 4.7 deg in the optical domain. In a 5-meter free-space link, the chip achieves error-free transmission at 10 Gbps for microwave and 80 Gbps per wavelength in the near infrared band. These results establish integrated microwave photonics as a promising platform for bridging Earth and orbit through compact, dual-band, beamforming-enabled transceivers.

Scientific mobility shapes individual research careers and national innovation by enabling knowledge exchange, fostering collaborations, and providing access to leading research environments. Studying international mobility patterns of researchers from developing countries offers insights into strengthening domestic scientific ecosystems and addressing talent migration. We analyze the international mobility of India-affiliated researchers using longitudinal affiliation trajectories from the OpenAlex database, covering 157,471 researchers categorized as immobile, returnees, or settled abroad after moving to the US, EU, or other high-income countries. Our analysis shows that 28% experience at least one international move, yet over 73% never return, highlighting persistent brain drain. Internationally mobile researchers predominantly originate from premier Indian institutions. Matched pair analyses demonstrate that mobility yields lasting benefits: citation impact increases, publication rates align with immobile peers, and international collaboration rises-foreign co-author share grows from 52% to 83-87% at transition abroad and remains elevated among returnees (32-40 percentage points across disciplines). Returnees maintain global networks, bridging Indian science with global research. These patterns are consistent across major research disciplines, emphasizing that scientific mobility drives excellence and engagement while posing challenges for developing nations seeking to reintegrate talent.

Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for the automatic segmentation of spinal nerve rootlets on various MRI scans. Material and Methods: This retrospective study included MRI scans from two open-access and one private dataset, consisting of 3D isotropic 3T TSE T2-weighted (T2w) and 7T MP2RAGE (T1-weighted [T1w] INV1 and INV2, and UNIT1) MRI scans. A deep learning model, RootletSeg, was developed to segment C2-T1 dorsal and ventral spinal rootlets. Training was performed on 76 scans and testing on 17 scans. The Dice score was used to compare the model performance with an existing open-source method. Spinal levels derived from RootletSeg segmentations were compared with vertebral levels defined by intervertebral discs using Bland-Altman analysis. Results: The RootletSeg model developed on 93 MRI scans from 50 healthy adults (mean age, 28.70 years $\pm$ 6.53 [SD]; 28 [56%] males, 22 [44%] females) achieved a mean $\pm$ SD Dice score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.09 for T1w-INV2, 0.65 $\pm$ 0.11 for UNIT1, 0.64 $\pm$ 0.08 for T2w, and 0.62 $\pm$ 0.10 for T1w-INV1 contrasts. Spinal-vertebral level correspondence showed a progressively increasing rostrocaudal shift, with Bland-Altman bias ranging from 0.00 to 8.15 mm (median difference between level midpoints). Conclusion: RootletSeg accurately segmented C2-T1 spinal rootlets across MRI contrasts, enabling the determination of spinal levels directly from MRI scans. The method is open-source and can be used for a variety of downstream analyses, including lesion classification, neuromodulation therapy, and functional MRI group analysis.

Towards a Robust Machine-Learning Pipeline for 21-cm Cosmology Data Analysis I: A Roadmap for Development and Demonstration of Robustness Against PSF Modeling Errors

The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.

Fast momentum-selective transport of Bose-Einstein condensates via controlled non-adiabatic dynamics in optical lattices

We present a detailed numerical study of a protocol for momentum-selective transport of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional optical lattice, achieving narrow momentum distributions through controlled non-adiabatic dynamics. The protocol consists of non-adiabatic loading into the lattice, coherent acceleration using a symmetric trapezoidal acceleration profile, and non-adiabatic release into free space. Using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we simulate the full sequence and analyze the role of non-adiabatic excitations on the final momentum distribution. We identify the intra-site breathing dynamics as the dominant mechanism governing spectral purity under fast loading conditions. By tracking the condensate's spatial width during the evolution, we demonstrate a direct correlation with the final momentum spread. A variational model based on a Gaussian ansatz quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics and provides physical insight into the breathing mechanism. Our results reveal the existence of magic times, i.e. specific loading or acceleration durations synchronized with the breathing oscillation period, where quasi-monochromatic momentum distributions can be achieved even with loading times as short as 100 $\mu$s, offering a route to coherent transport that is faster than adiabatic protocols. This approach is particularly relevant for quantum sensors operating under stringent timing constraints.

Subtleties in the pseudomodes formalism

The pseudomode method for open quantum systems, also known as the mesoscopic leads approach, consists in replacing a structured environment by a set of auxiliary "pseudomodes" subject to local damping that approximate the environment's spectral density. Determining what parameters and geometry to use for the auxiliary modes, however, is non-trivial and involves many subtleties. In this paper we revisit this problem of pseudomode design and investigate some of these subtleties. In particular, we examine the scenario in which pseudomodes couple to each other, resulting in an effective spectral density that is no longer a sum of Lorentzians. We show that non-diagonalizability of the pseudomodes' effective single-particle non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can lead to terms in the effective spectral density which cannot be obtained by diagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also present a method for constructing the pseudomode parameters to exactly match a fit to a spectral density, and in doing so illuminate the enormous freedom in this process. The case of many uncoupled pseudomodes is explored, and we show how, contrary to conventional assumption, the effective spectral density does not necessarily converge in the limit of an infinite number of pseudomodes; we attribute this to the non-completeness of Lorentzians as basis functions. Finally, we discuss how the notion of effective spectral densities can also emerge in the context of scattering theory for non-interacting systems.

The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located >=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of <10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts

Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.

Active fluids can develop spontaneous flow instabilities and complex patterns. However, spatio-temporal control of active particles has remained challenging, despite its relevance in biological and applied contexts. Here, we harnessed phototaxis to steer millions of swimming ``puller" Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae to create active jets and control both pearling and buckling instabilities through the preferential orientation of the cells. Our experiments, supported by a full analytical model and simulations, confirm long-standing predictions that self-generated flows can lead to jet destabilization. Our results further indicate that pullers can behave analogously to pushers when their orientation is properly tuned, and demonstrate how light enables efficient control of active fluids.

Using a combination of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations, we investigate the stability of coherent structures in a suspension of strongly aligned active swimmers. We show that a dilute jet of pullers undergoes a pearling instability, while a jet of pushers exhibits a helical (or, in two dimensions, zigzag) instability. We further characterise the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities, deriving exact and approximate solutions for the spreading and mutual attraction of puller clusters, as well as the wavelength coarsening of the helical instability. Our theoretical predictions closely match the experimentally observed wavelengths, timescales, and flow fields in suspensions of photophobic algae, as well as results from direct numerical simulations. These findings reveal the intrinsic instability mechanisms of aligned active suspensions and demonstrate that coherent structures can be destabilised by the flows they generate.

CSP is gaining clinical significance owing to its ability to restore a physiological activation sequence in the ventricles. While His bundle pacing (HBP) producing the most physiological activation is preferable, due to implant complications the selective activation of the LBB by left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is considered an alternative, offering both a simpler implant and a physiological activation sequence. However, the physical mechanisms facilitating selective activation of the LBB remain poorly understood. We developed a structurally and biophysically detailed computer model of the IVS and LBB to quantitatively elucidate the role of lead position, orientation and polarity in achieving optimal s-LBBP thresholds, using a geometrically detailed model of a clinically widely used CSP lead. A deep implant within the LV sub-endocardium ensuring a direct contact between electrode and LBB is key for effective s-LBBP. For low strength s-LBBP is feasible, but capturing the LBB in its entirety could only be achieved using higher strengths that led to non-selective left bundle branch pacing (ns-LBBP). Switching the tip polarity to anodal was not beneficial, requiring higher strengths to activate the LBB. Lead orientation relative to the LBB bundles was found to influence the s-LBBP capture threshold and the number of synchronously activating bundles. The model explains the impedance trends that are clinically observed when advancing the tip through the IVS into the LBB region, as well as sudden impedance drops associated with implant complications such as septal perforation or lead dislodgement. Quantitative consistence with clinically observed trends support model credibility, and indicate that simulation may offer an effective approach for guiding the design of improved CSP leads, facilitating a selective and synchronous activation of the entire LBB.

Quantum computing enables the efficient resolution of complex problems, often outperforming classical methods across various applications. In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.

Colloidal microgel particles such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) undergo a reversible volume phase transition at a volume phase transition temperature, VPTT, in aqueous media. Although the particles shrink in size as the temperature is raised beyond the VPTT, Romeo et al. [Adv. Mater. 2010, 22, 3441-3445] had previously shown that dense aqueous PNIPAM suspensions transform from one viscoelastic solid-like phase to another, with an intermediate viscoelastic liquid-like phase near the VPTT, due to a change in the inter-particle interaction from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Here, we show using a combination of experimental techniques that particle hydrophobicity can be significant even below the VPTT and can result in the emergence of attractive gel-like phases. We achieve this by incorporating polar salts such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride, or non-polar additives such as sucrose, to the aqueous medium. Above the VPTT, we observe that suspension rigidity is the highest in the presence of polar salts because of the combined effects of ionic and hydrophobic attractions. In the presence of non-dissociating sucrose, in contrast, the inter-microgel interaction remains hydrophobic across the VPTT. Such easy tunability of interactions by incorporating commonly available chemicals into the suspension medium opens up new avenues for the synthesis of novel metamaterials.

With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.

Microstructurally arrested matter, from molecular glasses to soft glassy materials, can retain a memory of their thermal or mechanical (shear) histories. Their history-dependent and nonlinear microstructural recoveries have been studied within the Kovacs framework. Here, we applied the temperature ramps of varying magnitudes to dense colloidal suspensions of thermoresponsive, deformable and compressible microgel particles should serve as an effective strategy to probe the nonlinear path-dependent structural recovery of these systems. We synthesised Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles using the free radical precipitation polymerisation method. Using oscillatory rheology, we studied the relaxations of the viscoelastic moduli of dense PNIPAM suspensions that were heated and cooled at various temperature ramp rates. Path-dependent structural recovery was quantified by studying the asymmetric approach of the suspension elastic modulus toward the final temperature during the heating and cooling temperature ramps. The loss modulus peaks, observed at the times of initiation and termination of the temperature ramps, were understood to arise from energy dissipation due to microgel rearrangement events and found to be inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the elastic response. Our work highlights the important role of energy dissipation through microgel rearrangements in eliminating path-dependent asymmetries in the storage moduli of dense PNIPAM glasses subjected to thermal shocks. By tuning the applied temperature ramp rate and particle packing density, therefore, asymmetric storage modulus relaxations in dense systems can be modulated via adjustments of the accessible free volume.

$Δ_T$ Noise as a Robust Diagnostic for Chiral, Helical and Trivial Edge Modes

In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive, practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature, finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.

We analyze the inner debris disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani using simulated observations with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C). Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we generate synthetic scattered-light images and spectral energy distributions for three disk models that differ in inclination and radial extent, and compare these results with the anticipated performance of CPI-C. CPI-C can resolve disk structures down to $\sim$3 au, offering substantially finer spatial resolution than existing HST/STIS and Spitzer/IRS observations. Recovered inclinations and radial extents closely match the input models, constraining the disk geometry and informing potential planet-disk interactions in the $\epsilon$ Eri system. Although the cold Jupiter-like planet $\epsilon$ Eri b is not detected in our simulations, polarimetric methods may enable detection of its reflected light. These results highlight the capability of next-generation coronagraphs to probe cold dust in nearby planetary systems.

We introduce the concept of quantum printing -- the imprinting of quantum states from photons and phonons onto quantum matter. The discussion is focusing on charged fluids (metals, superconductors, Hall fluids) and neutral systems (magnets, excitons). We demonstrate how structured light can generate topological excitations, including vortices in superconductors and skyrmions in magnets. We also discuss how quantum printing induces magnetization in quantum paraelectrics and strain-mediated magnetization in Dirac materials. Finally, we propose future applications, such as printing entangled photon states, creating entangled topological excitations, and discuss applications of quantum printing to light induced quantum turbulence in a charged fluid. This review represents the expanded version of the shorter review submitted to Nature Physics.

Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are <20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by <10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.

We investigate the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of a bilayer system made of $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where $X=d,g,i$ corresponds to altermagnets. A universal analytic formula is derived for the TMR ratio. It is proportional to $\left\vert J\right\vert /\left( N_{X}\Gamma \right) $ for small $\Gamma $, where $N_{X}$ is the number of the nodes of the $X$% -wave magnet, $J$ is the strength of the $X$-wave magnet, and $\Gamma $ is the self-energy. It is contrasted with the TMR ratio made of ferromagnets, where it is proportional to $J^{2}/\Gamma ^{2}$ for small $\Gamma $. Therefore, the TMR ratio is larger in ferromagnets for $\left\vert J\right\vert >\Gamma $. However, the $X$-wave magnets are expected to achieve high-speed and ultra-dense memory owing to the zero net magnetization.

Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target for CO2 reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock this http URL acetic acid can be produced by prhotocatalytic CO2 redcution. Among other multicarbon products, it is typically a low-yieleded product due to competing reaction pathways and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic acid yield of 962 umolg-1h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3%. The yield is ten times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining state-of-the-art selectivity. The remarkable The remarkable productivity arises from synergistic cooperation between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S sites on (102) crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction that could enable the synthesis and scalable production of various multicarbon products.

Nonadiabatic H-Atom Scattering Channels on Ge(111) Elucidated by the Hierarchical Equations of Motion

Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.

The W state, as a robust multipartite entangled state, plays an important role in quantum information processing, quantum network construction and quantum computing. In this paper, we encode quantum information on the effective energy levels of Rydberg superatoms and propose a fast scheme for preparing the Rydberg superatom W state based on the superadiabatic iterative technique, this scheme can be achieved in only one step by controlling the laser pulses. In the current scheme, the superatoms are trapped in spatially separated cavities connected by optical fibers, which significantly enhances the feasibility of experimental manipulation. A remarkable feature is that it does not require precise control of experimental parameters and interaction time. Meanwhile, the form of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian is the same as that of the effective Hamiltonian. Through numerical simulations, the fidelity of this scheme can reach 99.94%. Even considering decoherence effects, including atomic spontaneous emission and photon leakage, the fidelity can still exceed 97.5%, further demonstrating the strong robustness of the solution. In addition, the Rabi frequency can be characterized as a linear superposition of Gaussian functions, this representation significantly alleviates the complexity encountered in practical experiments. Futhermore, we also analyzed the impact of parameter fluctuations on the fidelity, the results show that this scheme is robust against parameter fluctuations. At last, the present scheme is extended to the cases of N Rydberg superatoms, which shows the scalability of our scheme.

Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.

Universal two-excitation scattering in two-dimensional subwavelength atomic arrays

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering strong light-matter interactions, presenting exciting opportunities for quantum science. However, a full understanding of their multi-excitation dynamics remains a significant challenge. In this work, we uncover a remarkable universal phenomenon that emerges in these arrays. Using scattering theory to analyze two-excitation interactions, we reveal a profound simplification near critical points of the collective atomic excitation band structure, determined solely from single-excitation properties. At these critical points, scattering becomes universal and the full two-excitation scattering matrix decomposes into a block-diagonal form. Remarkably, all scattering processes involving the photon field are completely suppressed, resulting in the perfect isolation of a unitary, nonlinear interaction channel between collective dark spin waves. Our findings provide exact analytical insights into few-body nonlinearities and establish a universal framework for analyzing complex scattering phenomena in ordered atomic systems.

Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\textit{Diacamma}$ $\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.

Subwavelength atomic arrays are a leading platform for engineering light-matter interactions, enabling near-perfect single-photon mirrors and robust quantum memories based on long-lived dark spin waves. However, a comprehensive theory of their nonlinear, multi-excitation dynamics has remained a significant challenge. We present a unified quantum scattering theory that treats both photons and collective atomic spin waves as distinct propagating excitations interacting across different spatial dimensions. Our central result is a powerful analytical reduction: we demonstrate that the complete multi-channel S-matrix and the associated scattering cross sections are exactly determined by the effective scattering dynamics solely within the atomic spin wave subspace. This maps the complex physical problem of photon-atom interactions to a conceptually simpler one involving only atomic modes. We apply this formalism to the two-excitation case, deriving the complete analytical S-matrix and scattering cross sections for systems with two-level nonlinearities. Our work provides a versatile analytic tool for analyzing and engineering complex quantum nonlinear phenomena, including multi-excitation subradiance, in large-scale atomic systems.

The geometry of a star's Alfvén surface determines stellar angular momentum loss, separates a causally distinct 'corona' and stellar wind, and potentially affects exoplanetary habitability. The solar Alfvén surface is the only such structure that is directly measurable and since 2021, has been routinely measured in situ by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker). We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfvén surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfvén speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfvén surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfvén surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfvénic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.

Machine learned coarse grained (CG) potentials are fast, but degrade over time when simulations reach undersampled biomolecular conformations, and generating widespread all atom (AA) data to combat this is computationally infeasible. We propose a novel active learning framework for CG neural network potentials in molecular dynamics (MD). Building on the CGSchNet model, our method employs root mean squared deviation (RMSD) based frame selection from MD simulations in order to generate data on the fly by querying an oracle during the training of a neural network potential. This framework preserves CG level efficiency while correcting the model at precise, RMSD identified coverage gaps. By training CGSchNet, a coarse grained neural network potential, we empirically show that our framework explores previously unseen configurations and trains the model on unexplored regions of conformational space. Our active learning framework enables a CGSchNet model trained on the Chignolin protein to achieve a 33.05% improvement in the Wasserstein 1 (W1) metric in Time lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) space on an in house benchmark suite.

Advances in deep learning have opened an era of abundant and accurate predicted protein structures; however, similar progress in protein ensembles has remained elusive. This review highlights several recent research directions towards AI-based predictions of protein ensembles, including coarse-grained force fields, generative models, multiple sequence alignment perturbation methods, and modeling of ensemble descriptors. An emphasis is placed on realistic assessments of the technological maturity of current methods, the strengths and weaknesses of broad families of techniques, and promising machine learning frameworks at an early stage of development. We advocate for "closing the loop" between model training, simulation, and inference to overcome challenges in training data availability and to enable the next generation of models.

Relativistically-strong electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Using a two-fluid approach, we consider the properties of relativistically nonlinear (arbitrary $a_0$), circularly polarized electromagnetic waves propagating along magnetic field in electron-ion and pair plasmas. Dispersion relations depend on how wave intensity scales with frequency, $a_0 (\omega)$. For superluminal branches, the nonlinear effects reduce the cut-off frequency, while the general form of the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ remains similar to the linear case. For subluminal waves, whistlers and Alfven, a new effect appears: dispersion curves effectively terminate at finite $\omega^\ast - k^\ast$ due to current starvation. Qualitatively, subluminal modes with fluctuating electric field larger than the guide field, $E_w (\omega) \geq B_0$, cannot propagate.

Clinically, palpation is one of the important diagnostic methods to assess tumor malignancy. In laboratory research, it is well accepted that the bulk stiffness of the tumor and the surrounding tissue is closely correlated with the malignant state of the tumor. Here, we postulate that, in addition to tumor stiffness, tumor viscoelasticity - the fact that tumor tissue takes time to bounce back after compression, can also be used to evaluate the tumor malignancy state. In this work, we characterized the viscoelastic properties of breast tumor spheroids using a recently developed microfluidic compression device and a theoretical power law model. Breast tumor cells at varying malignant levels; a non-tumorigenic epithelial (MCF10A), moderately malignant tumor (MCF7) and triple negative metastatic tumor (MDA-MB-231) cells were used. Spheroids embedded within a 3D extracellular matrix were periodically compressed, and their strain responses were recorded using microscopic imaging. Our results revealed that the measured strain relaxation curves can be successfully described by a modified power law model, demonstrated that non-tumorigenic tumor spheroids were more elastic, exhibited shorter relaxation time and less plasticity than those of tumorigenic spheroids. Together, these results highlight that viscoelastic properties in addition to bulk stiffness of the tumor spheroids can serve as a complementary mechanical biomarker of tumor malignancy and demonstrate the validity of a modified power law model for the mechanical characterization of a living tissue.

Automating radiology report generation poses a dual challenge: building clinically reliable systems and designing rigorous evaluation protocols. We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy) and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets, where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report generation.

Enabling a hydrogen economy requires the development of materials resistant to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). More than 100 years of research have led to several mechanisms and models describing how hydrogen interacts with lattice defects and leads to mechanical property degradation. However, solutions to protect materials from hydrogen are still scarce. Here, we investigate the role of interstitial solutes in protecting critical crystalline defects sensitive to hydrogen. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon in solid solutions at grain boundaries can efficiently prevent hydrogen segregation. We then realized this interface protection concept on martensitic steel, a material strongly prone to HE, by doping the most sensitive interfaces with different concentrations of boron and carbon. This segregation, in addition to stress relaxations, critically reduced the hydrogen ingress by half, leading to an unprecedented resistance against HE. This tailored interstitial segregation strategy can be extended to other metallic materials susceptible to hydrogen-induced interfacial failure

The usual cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is proved to sustain one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) broad (flat-top) solitons. In this work, we demonstrate that 1D and 2D soliton families can be supported, in the semi-infinite bandgap (SIBG), by the interplay of a lattice potential and the nonlinearity including self-defocusing cubic and self-focusing quintic terms, with the sign combination inverted with respect to the usual CQ nonlinearity. The families include fundamental and dipole solitons in 1D, and fundamental, quadrupole, and vortex solitons in 2D. The power, shapes, and stability of the solitons are reported. The results are strongly affected by the positions of the solitons in SIBG, the families being unstable very close to or very far from the SIBG's edge. The inverted CQ nonlinearity, considered in this work, sustains sharp 1D and 2D stable solitons, which can be naturally used as bit pixels in photonic data-processing applications.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common neuropathic disorder; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. A prevailing theory suggests that nitric oxide (NO) may induce nerve compression and irritation via vascular dilation, thereby being responsible for the condition, making real-time detection of generated NO critical. However, traditional evaluations of NO rely on indirect colorimetric or chemiluminescence techniques, which offer limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for its real-time assessment in biological environments. Herein, we reported the development of a highly sensitive NO electrochemical biosensor based cerium single-atom nanozyme (Ce1-CN) with ultrawide linear range from 1.08 nM to 143.9 {\mu}M, and ultralow detection limit of 0.36 nM, which enables efficient and real-time evaluation of NO in TN rats. In-situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed the high-performance biosensing mechanism, whereby the Ce centers in Ce1-CN nanoenzymes adsorb NO and subsequently react with OH- to form *HNO2. Results demonstrated that NO concentration was associated with TN onset. Following carbamazepine treatment, NO production from nerves decreased, accompanied by an alleviation of pain. These findings indicate that the biosensor serves as a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of TN and guiding subsequent therapeutic strategies.

Although the homotopy-knot theory has been utilized to implement effective topological classification for non-Hermitian systems, the physical implications underlying distinct knot topologies remain ambiguous and are rarely addressed. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional non-Hermitian four-band lattice model and map out its phase diagram according to the distinct knot structures residing in the moment space. The topological phase diagram is ascertained through a spectral winding number. Furthermore, we derive the exact analytic formula for the phase boundaries that delineate different knot topologies. To explore the concrete physical implications of distinct knot topologies, we investigate the many-body ground state entanglement entropy for free fermions loaded on such non-Hermitian lattice in real space. It turns out that different knot topologies imply different magnitudes of entanglement. Moreover, we show that the central charge c extracted from systematic finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy provides effective description of the phase diagram of the knot topology. Finally, we further confirm the phase boundaries for the topological phase transitions alternatively by numerical calculations of the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility. Our results showcase the connection between knot topology and entanglement of non-Hermitian systems and may facilitate further exploration of the profound and practical physical implications of knot topology.

Free expansion of a charged nanoparticle via electrostatic compensation

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Coherent wavepacket expansion is a key component of recent proposals aiming to create non-classical states of a levitated dielectric nanoparticle. Free evolution, i.e., releasing the particle from its harmonic trapping potential and allowing its position variance to grow, is a simple but effective expansion scheme, but requires accurate force compensation to avoid significant mean displacements of the wavepacket during the free evolution. Here, using an optical trap-release-recapture sequence, we demonstrate an electrostatic compensation technique that enables free evolution without significant mean displacement in 3D, successfully compensating both gravity and stray electric fields. To achieve 100 microsecond free evolution times with charged particles, we developed methods to map and correct for force cross-talk, as well as to control the environmental charge state. Combined with a low decoherence environment, our approach enables the preparation of largely delocalized states without the need for long freefall trajectories or a low-gravity environment.

We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case, the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma, leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for diamond-based electronics.

Detection of isolated specular reflection for calibration of cloud thermodynamic phase estimation with quantum parametric mode sorting LIDAR

Specular reflection can be problematic for the determination of the cloud thermodynamic phase for near-nadir-pointing space LIDARs. A LIDAR system biased towards the specular contribution for backscatter, if near-concurrent to a conventional LIDAR, could calibrate the measurements required for cloud phase determination. One such system which shows promise for this is quantum parametric mode sorting (QPMS) LIDAR. Through a non-linear interaction and time-frequency mode selectivity, this system demonstrates in-band noise-rejection beyond what linear noise filtering can provide. This level of noise-rejection means the signal strength can be minimised, therefore biasing the specular contribution to the return signal. Here we provide a theoretical model of QPMS LIDAR applied to this scenario to instruct its feasibility.

Morphologies of a sagging elastica with intrinsic sensing and actuation
Vishnu Deo Mishra, S Ganga Prasath
Subjects:
Robotics (cs.RO); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
The morphology of a slender soft-robot can be modified by sensing its shape via sensors and exerting moments via actuators embedded along its body. The actuating moments required to morph these soft-robots to a desired shape are often difficult to compute due to the geometric non-linearity associated with the structure, the errors in modeling the experimental system, and the limitations in sensing and feedback/actuation capabilities. In this article, we explore the effect of a simple feedback strategy (actuation being proportional to the sensed curvature) on the shape of a soft-robot, modeled as an elastica. The finite number of sensors and actuators, often seen in experiments, is captured in the model via filters of specified widths. Using proportional feedback, we study the simple task of straightening the device by compensating for the sagging introduced by its self-weight. The device undergoes a hierarchy of morphological instabilities defined in the phase-space given by the gravito-bending number, non-dimensional sensing/feedback gain, and the scaled width of the filter. For complex shape-morphing tasks, given a perfect model of the device with limited sensing and actuating capabilities, we find that a trade-off arises (set by the sensor spacing & actuator size) between capturing the long and short wavelength features. We show that the error in shape-morphing is minimal for a fixed filter width when we choose an appropriate actuating gain (whose magnitude goes as a square of the filter width). Our model provides a quantitative lens to study and design slender soft devices with limited sensing and actuating capabilities for complex maneuvering applications.

In this paper, we establish structural analogies between core concepts in quantum mechanics and games. By constructing the Quantum Coin Toss on a quantum circuit, we preliminarily investigate the similarity between quantum system behavior and game behavior, thereby formulating the state-operation paradigm. Using this paradigm, we introduce the conceptual prototype of the State Space Interpretation (SSI). Based on mathematical and physical theories, particularly linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics, we define formal constructs including state space, evolution path, and derived concepts. With the SSI, a game is conceptualized as a state space, while a gameplay process corresponds to an evolution path within this space. We propose that the SSI constitutes a novel interpretation framework for game design and game studies. This framework aims to enhance understanding of games and function as a link between game studies and related fields.

Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is central in the study of ultrafast photoinduced insulator-to-metal phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, and a primary candidate for next-generation light-driven devices. However, the physical mechanism underlying its phase transition remains unresolved. Here, we use single-cycle light transients to perform phase-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy on VO$_2$ crystals. Our experiments reveal two processes: a structural transformation from the insulating monoclinic M1-VO$_2$ phase to the excited metallic rutile R*-VO$_2$ phase, followed by electron thermalization and relaxation dynamics intrinsic to the newly formed excited metallic phase.

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Methodology (stat.ME)
In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data Assimilation (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of Agent-Based Models (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques, or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise. In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted, model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.

It has been well-known that many real networks are scale-free (SF) but extremely vulnerable against attacks. We investigate the robustness of connectivity and the lengths of the shortest loops in randomized SF networks with realistic exponents $2.0 < \gamma \leq 4.0$. We show that smaller variance of degree distributions leads to stronger robustness and longer average length of the shortest loops, which means the existing of large holes. These results will provide important insights toward enhancing the robustness by changing degree distributions.

We demonstrate a novel hybrid nanophotonic trap for cold neutral atoms, leveraging surface forces for attraction and blue-detuned evanescent light for repulsion. We attribute the attractive potential to a combination of Casimir-Polder interactions and electrostatic charges distributed on the waveguide surface. Despite the trap's shallow depth, we efficiently load atoms into it via adiabatic transfer from a conventional two-color dipole trap. Remarkably, the hybrid trap supports a long atomic storage time of 140(9) ms and exhibits a Ramsey coherence time of 16.8(2) ms, the latter exceeding significantly previous reports for nanophotonic systems. Our results pave the way for further exploration of atom-surface interactions at the nanoscale and illustrate the potential of harnessing surface forces to enhance storage and coherence times for atoms coupled to nanophotonic waveguides. This advancement offers new opportunities for neutral-atom quantum technologies.

Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)
This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.

Topological Mechanics of Entangled Networks

Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials.

On the mean-field limit for the for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions

We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|>N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.

Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfvén waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\sim 0.1$~R$_\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\sim 10$~R$_\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.

Catalysis at solid-liquid interfaces plays a central role in the advancement of energy storage and sustainable chemical production technologies. By enabling accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261 calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25 constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015 eV/Å, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.

These flybys all passed from dusk to dawn through the nightside equatorial region but were noticeably different from each other. In the first flyby, we observe a low latitude boundary layer and $\sim$1 keV ions near closest approach. For flybys 2 and 3 we see ions up to 14 keV in the same location, including freshly injected precipitating ions inside the loss cone. High time resolution data from flyby 3 show variations consistent with bursty bulk flows 10s long and occurring over $\sim30$s periods, the first such observation in this region. MIPA data demonstrate that high-energy injection processes are an important source of precipitation ions at Mercury.

Entangling gates are an essential capability of quantum computers. There are different methods for implementing two-qubit gates, with respective advantages and disadvantages. We investigate the experimentally relevant differences and commonalities of laser-based $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ light-shift and $\sigma_\phi\otimes\sigma_\phi$ Moelmer-Soerensen gates, highlighting the phases of experimental control fields and their long-term stabilities, in the specific case of mixed-species gates. We implement these gates on qubits with very different magnetic field sensitivities, encoded in $^{43}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ and $^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^+$, achieving fidelities of $99.8\%$ for the $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ and $99.6\%$ for the $\sigma_\phi\otimes\sigma_\phi$ gate.

Effective decoupling of mutations and the resulting loss of biodiversity caused by environmental change

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.

Accurate multi-needle localization in intraoperative CT images is crucial for optimizing seed placement in pelvic seed implant brachytherapy. However, this task is challenging due to poor image contrast and needle adhesion. This paper presents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle detection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free network, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and accurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and orientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle prediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a greedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced assignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method iteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on a distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100 patients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing the nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for needle localization in complex clinical scenarios.

We show how to optimally reduce the local Hilbert basis of lattice quantum many-body (QMB) Hamiltonians. The basis truncation exploits the most relevant eigenvalues of the estimated single-site reduced density matrix (RDM). It is accurate and numerically stable across different model phases, even close to quantum phase transitions. We apply this procedure to different models, such as the Sine-Gordon model, the $\varphi^{4}$ theory, and lattice gauge theories, namely Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, in one and two spatial dimensions. Our results reduce state-of-the-art estimates of computational resources for classical and quantum simulations.

Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.

We study intriguing dynamical features of hot Rubidium atoms driven by two light fields. The fields resonantly drive multiple Zeeman states within two hyperfine levels, yielding a cascaded-$\Lambda$ like structure in the frequency space. A non-Hermitian Floquet tight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping between the nearest states effectively describes the coherence dynamics between Zeeman states within the ground hyperfine manifold. By performing spin noise spectroscopy, we observe higher harmonic peaks in the noise spectrum that capture multi-photon transitions in the ground manifold. Moreover, the peak amplitudes reveal a power-law decay of long-range coherence with increasing separation between the ground states.

This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} > \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.

Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.

Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.

In this Letter, we report phase-matched four-wave mixing separated by over one-octave in a dispersion engineered crystalline microresonator. Experimental and numerical results presented here confirm that primary sidebands were generated with a frequency shift up to 140 THz, and that secondary sidebands formed a localized comb structure, known as a clustered comb in the vicinity of the primary sidebands. A theoretical analysis of the phase-matching condition validated our experimental observations, and our results good agree well with numerical simulations. These results offer the potential to realize a frequency tunable comb cluster generator operating from 1 um to mid-infrared wavelengths with a single and compact device.

Randomness in appendage coordination facilitates strenuous ground self-righting

Randomness is common in biological and artificial systems, resulting either from stochasticity of the environment or noise in organisms or devices themselves. In locomotor control, randomness is typically considered a nuisance. For example, during dynamic walking, randomness in stochastic terrain leads to metastable dynamics, which must be mitigated to stabilize the system around limit cycles. Here, we studied whether randomness in motion is beneficial for strenuous locomotor tasks. Our study used robotic simulation modeling of strenuous, leg-assisted, winged ground self-righting observed in cockroaches, in which unusually large randomness in wing and leg motions is present. We developed a simplified simulation robot capable of generating similar self-righting behavior and varied the randomness level in wing-leg coordination. During each wing opening attempt, the more randomness added to the time delay between wing opening and leg swinging, the more likely it was for the naive robot (which did not know what coordination is best) to self-right within a finite time. Wing-leg coordination, measured by the phase between wing and leg oscillations, had a crucial impact on self-righting outcome. Without randomness, periodic wing and leg oscillations often limited the system to visit a few bad phases, leading to failure to escape from the metastable state. With randomness, the system explored phases thoroughly and had a better chance of encountering good phases to self-right. Our study complements previous work by demonstrating that randomness helps destabilize locomotor systems from being trapped in undesired metastable states, a situation common in strenuous locomotion.

Robots still struggle to dynamically traverse complex 3-D terrain with many large obstacles, an ability required for many critical applications. Body-obstacle interaction is often inevitable and induces perturbation and uncertainty in motion that challenges closed-form dynamic modeling. Here, inspired by recent discovery of a terradynamic streamlined shape, we studied how two body shapes interacting with obstacles affect turning and pitching motions of an open-loop multi-legged robot and cockroaches during dynamic locomotion. With a common cuboidal body, the robot was attracted towards obstacles, resulting in pitching up and flipping-over. By contrast, with an elliptical body, the robot was repelled by obstacles and readily traversed. The animal displayed qualitatively similar turning and pitching motions induced by these two body shapes. However, unlike the cuboidal robot, the cuboidal animal was capable of escaping obstacle attraction and subsequent high pitching and flipping over, which inspired us to develop an empirical pitch-and-turn strategy for cuboidal robots. Considering the similarity of our self-propelled body-obstacle interaction with part-feeder interaction in robotic part manipulation, we developed a quasi-static potential energy landscape model to explain the dependence of dynamic locomotion on body shape. Our experimental and modeling results also demonstrated that obstacle attraction or repulsion is an inherent property of locomotor body shape and insensitive to obstacle geometry and size. Our study expanded the concept and usefulness of terradynamic shapes for passive control of robot locomotion to traverse large obstacles using physical interaction. Our study is also a step in establishing an energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions.

To traverse complex three-dimensional terrainwith large obstacles, animals and robots must transition across different modes. However, the most mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion concerns how to generate and stabilize near-steady-state, single-mode locomotion (e.g. walk, run). We know little about how to use physical interaction to make robust locomotor transitions. Here, we review our progress towards filling this gap by discovering terradynamic principles of multi-legged locomotor transitions, using simplified model systems representing distinct challenges in complex three-dimensional terrain. Remarkably, general physical principles emerge across diverse model systems, by modelling locomotor-terrain interaction using a potential energy landscape approach. The animal and robots' stereotyped locomotor modes are constrained by physical interaction. Locomotor transitions are stochastic, destabilizing, barrier-crossing transitions on the landscape. They can be induced by feed-forward self-propulsion and are facilitated by feedbackcontrolled active adjustment. General physical principles and strategies from our systematic studies already advanced robot performance in simple model systems. Efforts remain to better understand the intelligence aspect of locomotor transitions and how to compose larger-scale potential energy landscapes of complex three-dimensional terrains from simple landscapes of abstracted challenges. This will elucidate how the neuromechanical control system mediates physical interaction to generate multi-pathway locomotor transitions and lead to advancements in biology, physics, robotics and dynamical systems theory.

On Mars, fields of sand dunes contrast with the general cratered, rocky terrain commonly seen from orbit. Near the equator, in Gale Crater, images from the rover, Curiosity, also reveal order on smaller scales: ripples on dunes, and ground patterns in scattered sites. The patterns include relatively inconspicuous forms: evenly spaced pebble-size rocks (termed clasts) on meter-scale domains of wind-blown sand. Here, we examine quantitatively several such domains on both Mars and Earth. The domains are significantly more orderly than expected by chance. Moreover, many are hyperuniform, a self-organized state recently recognized in diverse active materials and biological systems but that appears novel for planetary surfaces. We use numerical simulations to examine how diverse clast distributions, ranging from random and hyperuniform dispersions to distinct alignments, can emerge spontaneously from clast displacements induced by gravity, combined with the wind-driven evolution of the surface, sand transport, and ripple migration. This paper highlights easily overlooked self-organized patterns beyond distinct geometric patterns on at least two planets, and the simulations help understand the information coded in clast domains. Moreover, our methods and findings potentially have quantitatively implications for studies of issues of global significance on Earth, including dust emission from vast areas into the atmosphere.

Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.

A theory of quantum jumps is developed by using a new asymmetric equation, which is complementary to the Schrödinger equation. The new equation displays Bohr's rules for quantum jumps, and its solutions demonstrate that once a quantum jump takes place at a random time, then its evolution is continuous and coherent. The temporal solutions are used to determine time-scales of the quantum jumps, which are very short but finite. The spatial solutions are used to find the radial probability density of finding the electron after its jump. The obtained results are applied to the Lyman and Balmer series absorption, and their experimental verification is discussed.

Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise for downscaling global climate change projections under different approaches, including Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) emulation. Unlike emulators, PP downscaling models are trained on observational data, so it remains an open question whether they can plausibly extrapolate unseen conditions and changes in future emissions scenarios. Here we focus on this problem as the main drawback for the operationalization of these methods and present the results of an intercomparison experiment to evaluate the performance and extrapolation capability of existing models using a common experimental framework, taking into account the sensitivity of results to different training replicas. We focus on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over Spain, a region with a range of climatic conditions with different influential regional processes. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, limitations of existing methods, and prospects for future development.

Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs have inspired various intriguing applications such as spectroscopy, ranging, telecommunication, and high purity microwave generation. Mechanically actuated soliton microcombs provide enhanced controllability and flexibility for Kerr solitons, thus enabling technological progress to be made on such practical applications. Here, we present architectures for coherent dual-comb techniques and ultralow-noise microwave generation by exploiting the mechanical actuation of ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators. By unifying a pump laser, we demonstrate highly coherent dual-soliton combs using distinct resonators with slightly different repetition rates. We also report significant phase noise reduction achieved by directly generating Kerr solitons from a sub-Hz linewidth ultrastable laser. This study paves the way for further advancements in a wide variety of applications based on Kerr soliton microcombs.

Efficient Transition State Searches by Freezing String Method with Graph Neural Network Potentials

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Transition state (TS) searches are a critical bottleneck in computational studies of chemical reactivity, as accurately capturing complex phenomena like bond breaking and formation events requires repeated evaluations of expensive ab-initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). While numerous algorithms have been developed to locate TSs efficiently, the computational cost of PES evaluations remains a key limitation. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network (GNN) PES to accelerate TS searches for organic reactions. Our GNN of choice, SchNet, is first pre-trained on the ANI-1 dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on a small dataset of reactant, product, and TS structures. We integrate this GNN PES into the Freezing String Method (FSM), enabling rapid generation of TS guess geometries. Across a benchmark suite of chemically diverse reactions, our fine-tuned model (GNN-FT) achieves a 100% success rate, locating the reference TSs in all cases while reducing the number of ab-initio calculations by 72% on average compared to conventional DFT-based FSM searches. Fine-tuning reduces GNN-FT errors by orders of magnitude for out-of-distribution cases such as non-covalent interactions, and improves TS-region predictions with comparatively little data. Analysis of transition state geometries and energy errors shows that GNN-FT captures PES along the reaction coordinate with sufficient accuracy to serve as a reliable DFT surrogate. These results demonstrate that modern GNN potentials, when properly trained, can significantly reduce the cost of TS searches and broaden the scope and size of systems considered in chemical reactivity studies.

We propose accomplishing this via changing the target of the well established field of aerosol dispersal for large scale climate cooling from long term cooling to short term, locally targeted dispersal. We show that such should induce precipitation anywhere with sufficient humidity, and should be accomplishable at low cost and low or no safety concerns.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
A linear theory for unsteady aerodynamic effects of the actuator line method (ALM) was developed. This theory is validated using two-dimensional ALM simulations, where we compute the unsteady lift generated by the plunging and pitching motion of a thin airfoil in uniform flow, comparing the results with Theodorsen's theory. This comparison elucidates the underlying characteristics and limitations of ALM when applied to unsteady aerodynamics. Numerical simulations were conducted across a range of chord lengths and oscillation frequencies. Comparison of ALM results with theoretical predictions shows consistent accuracy, with all Gaussian parameter choices yielding accurate results at low reduced frequencies. Furthermore, the study indicates that selecting a width parameter ratio of $\varepsilon/c$ (the Gaussian width parameter over the chord length) between 0.33 and 0.4 in ALM yields the closest alignment with analytical results across a broader frequency range. Additionally, a proper definition of angle of attack for a pitching airfoil is shown to be important for accurate computations. These findings offer valuable guidance for the application of ALM in unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.

A new statistical definition for the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness is introduced, based on identification of the point where the streamwise velocity skewness changes sign, from negative to positive, in the outermost region of the boundary layer. Importantly, this definition is independent of arbitrary thresholds, and broadly applicable, including to past single-point measurements. Further, this definition is motivated by the phenomenology of streamwise velocity fluctuations near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, whose local characteristics are shown to be universal for turbulent boundary layers under low freestream turbulence conditions (i.e., with or without pressure gradients, surface roughness, etc.) through large-scale experiments, simulations and coherent structure-based modelling. The new approach yields a turbulent boundary layer thickness that is consistent with previous definitions, such as those based on Reynolds shear stress or `composite' mean velocity profiles, and which can be used practically e.g., to calculate integral thicknesses. Two methods are proposed for estimating the turbulent boundary layer thickness using this definition: one based on simple linear interpolation and the other on fitting a generalised Fourier model to the outer skewness profile. The robustness and limitations of these methods are demonstrated through analysis of several published experimental and numerical datasets, which cover a range of canonical and non-canonical turbulent boundary layers. These datasets also vary in key characteristics such as wall-normal resolution and measurement noise, particularly in the critical turbulent/non-turbulent interface region.

History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
In this paper, I aim to clarify the unconscious ideologies and attitudes held by physicists through Prigogine's work. Prigogine was an outstanding chemist and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. At the same time, he extended his ideas beyond physics into the humanities, engaging in an interdisciplinary exploration of scientific and philosophical thought. Due to this unique careers, Prigogine's reception has been deeply divided. However, rather than focusing on the controversies surrounding his work, this study highlights his intellectual endeavors, using them as a lens to examine the underlying worldview of modern physics. Through this analysis, I will uncover two distinct agnostic attitudes-one held by dynamicists and the other by Prigogine himself. Finally, drawing on Bergson's philosophy, I will explore Prigogine's vision of a new relationship between humans and nature, as well as his temopralization of time in broader context to extend their philosophy alive.

Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.

The absolute photodetachment cross-section characterizes the photostability of atomic and molecular anions against photodestruction by neutralization. The measurement of this quantity has been reported only for atomic and simple molecular ions. In 2006, Wester's group introduced a novel ion-trap-based technique to measure the absolute photodetachment cross-section [S. Trippel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 193003 (2006)] of OH^-. In the present work, we propose a novel methodology to streamline this technique to reduce the measurement time by several orders of magnitude by combining a single experimental rate measurement with a simulated column density distribution of the trapped ions. We validated our approach by reproducing the cross-section reported for OH^- at 632.8 nm. Using this technique, we report the first such measurement for a molecule of biological interest, deprotonated indole, at a laser wavelength of 403 nm. The proposed scheme is anticipated to have a significant and transformative impact on the development of a comprehensive database for photodetachment and photodissociation cross-sections of molecular ions. Furthermore, these measurements have the potential to drive the development of cutting-edge computational codes for cross-section calculations, enabling an unprecedentedly detailed understanding of electron dynamics in large molecules and the light-matter interaction.

Silicon-based semiconductor nanofabrication technology has achieved a remarkable level of sophistication and maturity, and color centers in silicon naturally inherit this advantage. Besides, their emissions appear in telecommunication bands, which makes them play a crucial role in the construction of quantum network. To address the challenge of weak spontaneous emission, different optical cavities are fabricated to enhance the emission rate. However, the relative location between cavity and emitter is random, which greatly reduce the success probability of enhancement. Here, we report on a fluorescence-localization technique (FLT) for precisely locating single G center in silicon and embedding it in the center of a circular Bragg grating cavity in situ, achieving 240-times improvement of the success probability. We observe a 30-fold enhancement in luminescence intensity, 2.5-fold acceleration of the emission from single G center, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 11. Our findings pave the way for the large-scale integration of quantum light sources including those with spins.

Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.

Using ab initio simulations, we computed Gibbs free energy and phase diagram for liquid and solid solutions of the Fe-Ni alloy under conditions close to the inner core, considering inner-shell electron contributions and non-ideal mixing effects. The Fe-Ni phase diagram provides crucial insights for understanding previous experimental observations and crystallization simulations of the Fe-Ni alloy under core conditions. It also presents new scenarios for inner core structures, suggesting bcc-liquid coexistence at the inner core boundary and the possibility of multi-layer structures consisting of bcc-hcp composites within the inner core. Our work clarifies nickel's substantial impact on the inner core structure, providing new constraints for the study of core's composition and formation.

Rapid muon tomography for border security

Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.

We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the time resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\: ps$ at the $1\sigma$ level.

High stakes exams inflate a gender gap and contribute to systematic grading errors in one introductory physics series

Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)
Previous research has suggested that changing the percentage of the course grade associated with exam grades in STEM courses can change the gender gap in the course. It has also been shown that assessments with the highest stakes have the lowest (relative) scores for female students. Previous research by the authors has shown that the implementation of retake exams can eliminate the gender gap in introductory physics courses. This paper explores several different hypotheses for why retake exams are associated with a zeroed gender gap. Two independent measurements comparing exams with different stakes are used in support of the argument that the entire gender gap on introductory physics exams may be due to the stakes associated with those exams. In other words, these data support the idea that a gender grade gap on exams is not measuring a gender difference in the physics knowledge or physics ability of these students. Implications suggest that instructors should choose lower stakes assessment options if they are interested in exam measurements that are not influenced by differences in students' performance related to exam stakes.

Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need

Subjects:

The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.

Improving the skill of medium-range (3-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.

Mass-Zero constrained molecular dynamics for electrostatic interactions

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Optimal exploitation of supercomputing resources for the evaluation of electrostatic forces remains a challenge in molecular dynamics simulations of very large systems. The most efficient methods are currently based on particle-mesh Ewald sums and achieve semi-logarithmic scaling in the number of particles. These methods solve the problem in reciprocal space, requiring extensive use of Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). While highly efficient in many contexts, FFTs may encounter scalability challenges at very large processor counts due to their communication requirements. To mitigate these problems, the development and scalable coding of real-space approaches to solve the Poisson equation on a grid is an active field of research. In this work, we introduce a novel real-space approach that provides some advantages over alternatives. Our method exploits an extended Lagrangian in which the values of the field at the grid points are treated as auxiliary variables of zero inertia and the discretized Poisson equation is enforced as a dynamical constraint. The solution of the constraints leads to a linear system - different from those appearing in other real-space approaches - that can be efficiently solved via state-of-the-art iterative methods. The method inherits the numerical scaling of the adopted iterative solver, e.g. linear with a multigrid (MG) approach, but converges with fewer cycles. We analyze this approach considering realistic simulations of molten NaCl that validate its ability to reproduce structural and transport properties. Using this non-trivial benchmark, we demonstrate linear scaling and illustrate some features of our algorithm.

Zitterbewegung, momentum and spin dynamics of electromagnetic waves in linear dielectric medium

The momentum of light in dielectric media has been a century-long controversy that continues to attract significant interest. In a linear dielectric medium with refractive index n, the momentum is predicted to be smaller by a factor of n according to Abraham, and larger by the same factor according to Minkowski. By studying the coupled dynamics of electromagnetic waves and dipoles in a dielectric medium, we show that the change in momentum of the dipole, expressed by the Lorentz force, corresponds to the Abraham momentum and is given by the expectation value of the spin-projected momentum vector. On the other hand, the Minkowski momentum is obtained as the magnitude of the spin-projected momentum vector from the energy-momentum dispersion relation derived by diagonalizing the coupled Hamiltonian and determines the direction of refraction in accordance with Snell's law. Our model also predicts a zitterbewegung-like oscillation due to helicity mixing between left- and right-handed wave components, mediated by dipole oscillation. These internal wave dynamics may be observable via wavepacket motion or polarization-sensitive measurements.

Aortic valve replacement is a key surgical procedure for treating aortic valve pathologies, such as stenosis and regurgitation. The precise placement of the prosthetic valve relative to the native aortic annulus plays a critical role in the post-operative hemodynamics. This study investigates how the positioning of a biological prosthetic valve - either intra-annular (within the native annulus) or supra-annular (slightly downstream, in the widened portion of the aortic root) - affects cardiac fluid dynamics. Using high-fidelity numerical simulations on a patient-specific left heart model derived from CT imaging, we simulate physiological flow conditions to isolate the impact of valve placement. Unlike previous clinical studies that compare different patients and valve models, our approach evaluates the same valve in both positions within a single virtual patient, ensuring a controlled comparison. Key hemodynamic parameters are assessed, including transvalvular pressure drop, effective orifice area, wall shear stress, and hemolysis. Results reveal that supra-annular implantation offers significant advantages: lower pressure gradients, larger orifice area, and reduced shear-induced stress. Furthermore, hemolysis analysis using advanced red blood cell stress models indicates a decreased risk of blood damage in the supra-annular configuration. These findings offer valuable insights to guide valve selection and implantation strategies, ultimately supporting improved patient outcomes.

AMTIR-1 chalcogenide glass has shown its potential for use in thermal imaging systems owing to its low refractive index, thermal resistance and high transparency across the infrared wavelength regime. Here we report a millimeter-scale high-Q whispering gallery mode microresonator made of AMTIR-1. The recorded Q-factor has reached $1.2\times10^7$ at 1550 nm, which is almost two-orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values. We characterize the thermal properties, where low thermal conductivity plays an important role in thermal resonance tuning. We further show that AMTIR-1 resonators support anomalous dispersion as well as a low absorption coefficient near the 7~\textmu m wavelength band, thus offering the possibility of providing suitable platforms for mid-infrared, long-wave infrared nonlinear optics including microresonator frequency comb generation.

A comprehensive study on beam dynamics inside symmetrically chirped waveguide array mimicking the graded index media

Optics (physics.optics)
In this article, we explore the beam dynamics within symmetrically chirped nonlinear waveguide arrays, focusing on linear and quadratic chirping schemes. We propose a practical structure for these arrays that enhances control over light propagation. By employing a continuous approximation of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLSE), we utilize a semi-analytical variational method to analyze beam behavior under waveguide chirping. Our findings indicate that the symmetrically chirped waveguide arrays behave similarly to graded index systems, with varying coupling coefficients analogous to the refractive index in continuous media. We derive a steady-state solution and validate it against numerical simulations, alongside conducting a linear stability analysis to assess the robustness of these solutions. The results reveal that input Gaussian beams in such waveguide arrays follow an oscillatory trajectory akin to that in parabolic index media. Notably, under nonlinear conditions, these beams evolve as discrete solitons. Our rigorous investigation of the propagation characteristics in both linear and nonlinear regimes highlights the intricate dynamics of optical beams within the engineered chirped waveguide arrays, supported by comparisons to comprehensive numerical simulations.

Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes

Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.

Vibrational-Electron Heating in Plasma Flows: A Thermodynamically Consistent Model

Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium {plasma} flows is critical, yet hampered by inadequate models for electron heating from vibrationally excited states. Prior models often relied on ad-hoc scaling or flawed applications of detailed balance that failed to ensure the convergence of electron temperature and species-specific vibrational temperature ($T_{\rm v}$) at thermal equilibrium. This paper introduces a novel, thermodynamically consistent electron heating model derived rigorously from the principle of detailed balance. By assuming a Boltzmann vibrational distribution and employing an effective activation energy, our approach yields a simple heating-to-cooling ratio of $\exp(\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$, where $\theta_{\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature of the species under consideration. This formulation guarantees that $T_{\rm e}$ correctly converges to $T_{\rm v}$ at equilibrium. A key advantage is that our model can utilize total cooling rates determined from swarm experiments, leading to higher accuracy at low electron temperatures. For re-entry flows, the proposed approach predicts an electron temperature several times lower than previous models which results in improved agreement with some flight test data. These more reliable predictions can significantly enhance the modeling fidelity of plasma-assisted combustion, laser-induced plasmas, and various hypersonic plasma technologies such as electron transpiration cooling or magnetohydrodynamic force generators.

We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.

The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.

For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.

We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.

The propagation of waves through the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and deeper into pack ice is a key phenomenon that influences the breakup and drift of sea ice. When waves in ice propagate through a solid, non-cracked, thick enough sea ice cover, significant flexural elastic effects can be present in the dispersion relation. This results in a dispersion relation that opens up for 3-wave interactions, also known as wave triads.
Here, we report the observation of high-frequency spectral peaks in the power spectral density of waves in ice spectra. We show, in two timeseries datasets, that the presence of these high-frequency peaks is accompanied by high values for the spectral bicoherence. This is a signature that the high-frequency peak is phase-locked with frequency components in the main spectral energy peak, and a necessary condition for nonlinear coupling to take place. Moreover, we show for a timeseries dataset that includes several closely located sensors that the dispersion relation recovered from a cross-spectrum analysis is compatible with the possible existence of wave triads at the same frequencies for which the bicoherence peak is observed. In addition to these observations in timeseries datasets, we show that similar high-frequency peaks are observed from additional, independent datasets of waves in ice power spectrum densities transmitted over iridium from autonomous buoys.
These results suggest that nonlinear energy transfers between wave in ice spectral components are likely to occur in some waves and sea ice conditions. This may enable redistribution of energy from weakly damped low-frequency waves to more strongly attenuated higher-frequency spectral components, which can contribute to energy dissipation in the ice.

Efficient transport of high-current negative ion beams is critical for accurate plasma potential diagnostics using heavy-ion beam probe (HIBP) systems in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. However, strong space-charge effects often degrade transport efficiency, particularly for heavy ions such as Au-. In this study, we demonstrate a substantial improvement in beam transport by introducing an electrostatic lens effect through optimized voltage allocation in a multistage acceleration system. Numerical simulations using IGUN, supported by experiments with the LHD-HIBP system, show that this approach effectively suppresses space-charge-induced beam divergence and loss. Without requiring mechanical modifications to the beamline, the optimized configuration enables a 2-3 fold increase in Au-beam current injected into the tandem accelerator. Consequently, plasma potential measurements were extended to higher-density plasmas, reaching line-averaged electron densities up to $1.75\times 10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ with improved signal-to-noise ratio. This technique offers a compact, practical, and highly effective solution for transporting high-current heavy-ion beams under space-charge-dominated conditions. Beyond its impact on plasma diagnostics, the method is broadly applicable to a wide range of accelerator systems, including those used in scientific and industrial applications where high-intensity beam transport is required.

We explore the efficacy of optical pumping on the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s8p\,{}^1P_1$ ($448\,\mathrm{nm}$) transition in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of Sr atoms. The number of trapped atoms is enhanced by a factor of $12.0(6)$ relative to the case without repumping light, which is six times as large as that obtained using the pumping transition $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s6p\,{}^1P_1$ ($717\,\mathrm{nm}$). This enhancement is limited by decay pathways that bypass the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ state, namely $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_1 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_0$ and $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$, which account for 8% of the total loss of the trapped atoms. We determine the decay rates for the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_1$ and $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_2$ transitions to be $66(6)\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $2.4(2)\times10^2\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, respectively. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time that, when the trap beam diameter is small, escape of atoms in the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ state, which has a relatively long lifetime of $400\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, becomes a dominant loss mechanism, and that the $448\,\mathrm{nm}$ pumping light effectively suppresses this escape. Our findings will contribute to improved laser cooling and fluorescence imaging in cold strontium atom platforms, such as quantum computers based on optical tweezer arrays.

Discrete-Time Two-Strain Epidemic Dynamics on Complex Networks

Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Probability (math.PR)
We investigate a discrete-time two-strain symbiotic epidemic model on complex networks with both random and long-range interactions. Our analysis examines how the co-infection recovery rate ($\mu$), the long-range decay exponent ($\alpha$), and the scale-free connectivity exponent ($\gamma$) shape epidemic persistence under cooperative dynamics. Comparison with a two-strain competition model shows how these parameters control strain dominance, coexistence, or extinction. The results demonstrate that contagion dynamics are strongly affected by environmental randomness and long-range couplings. In facultative symbiosis, the co-infection recovery rate undergoes a clear phase transition, separating persistence from extinction. In the competitive setting, regimes with $\alpha < 2$ and $\gamma < 3$ markedly lower the epidemic threshold, allowing persistence even at small contagion rates ($\sigma$). Statistical analysis further reveals that $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ exert pronounced, nonlinear, and time-dependent effects on strain survival.

Here, microdroplets are injected into a low-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma and exposed to an excess free-electron flux. We report the first measurements of droplet charge in a fully collisional plasma, with averages up to 2.5 $\times 10^{5}$ electrons for 15 $\mu$m droplets, dependent on absorbed power. Simulations indicate solid particles under similar conditions acquire $\sim$40\% less charge, likely due to low-mobility water cluster ion formation around evaporating droplets, and predict surface electric fields up to $10^{7}$ V m$^{-1}$ for the smallest droplets (3 $\mu$m). Plasma exposure also produces H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ in the liquid, with concentrations up to 33 mM, corresponding to remarkable generation rates exceeding 275 M s$^{-1}$. The system involves complex, not yet fully elucidated mechanisms. A controlled plasma environment enables defined charge levels and exposure times, allowing systematic study and enhancing droplet properties.

The N$\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.
In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.
The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.
To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\nu$DEx experiment.

GPU-acceleration of the Discontinuous Galerkin Shallow Water Equations Model (DG-SWEM) with OpenACC

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
This paper presents a porting of {DG-SWEM}, a first-order discontinuous Galerkin solver for storm surge based on the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC), to NVIDIA GPUs. Time-explicit discontinuous Galerkin methods contain a large number of degrees of freedom but have been shown to exhibit a large amount of data parallelism due to the loose coupling between elements, and thus are naturally mapped to the GPU architecture. A previous framework in porting DG-SWEM to GPUs required converting subroutines from Fortran to C++ to be used with CUDA C++. By using OpenACC and Unified Memory, we simplify the porting process and maintain a single codebase for both CPU and GPU versions. We test the code using a large Hurricane Harvey scenario on NVIDIA's Grace Hopper chip, and compare the GPU code's performance on multiple H200 nodes to the CPU version on the same amount of Grace CPU nodes.

Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from eight major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.

Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.

Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
We introduce circular under-threshold RABBITT (cuRABBITT) as a new interferometric method to probe discrete electronic excitations in atoms with attosecond resolution. By combining circularly polarized attosecond pulses with broadband (rainbow) spectral analysis, we directly access two-photon ionization amplitudes and their relative phases. Time-dependent Schrödinger simulations, supported by Green's function theory, reveal strong resonances in helium and argon and a Cooper-like minimum in xenon. These results demonstrate that cuRABBITT provides continuous spectral mapping of bound-state resonances and extends Fano's propensity rule into the under-threshold regime. Our work establishes cuRABBITT as a powerful attosecond metrology technique, opening the way to polarization-resolved studies of resonant dynamics in atoms and molecules.

In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line based on a Scandium alloyed aluminum nitride (AlScN)-on-sapphire platform operating at 5.9 GHz with an exceptionally high acoustic propagation Q-factor. An 800 nm AlScN thin film with 40% scandium alloying concentration was deposited on a thick sapphire substrate to achieve strong acoustic energy confinement and large electromechanical coupling effect, thereby minimizing the insertion loss (IL) and propagation loss (PL) of the acoustic delay line (ADL). The proposed ADL was designed to operate in the Sezawa mode using a Single-Phase Unidirectional Transducer (SPUDT) electrode configuration for better unidirectionality. The fabricated ADLs with different delay lengths, after conjugate matching, exhibited delay times spanning 13 to 214 ns and IL ranging from 7.6 to 18.3 dB. The extracted PL reached as low as 9.2 dB/mm at 5.9 GHz, with a group velocity (v_g) of around 5,779 m/s. Based on these results, the proposed ADLs exhibit a high acoustic propagation Q-factor of 3,044. These findings highlight the potential of AlScN-on-sapphire platforms for high operational frequency, low-loss SAW ADL devices in advanced RF applications.

Holey sheets: Double-Threshold Rupture of Draining Liquid Films

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Classical rupture is attributed to molecular (van der Waals) forces acting at nanometric thicknesses. Nonetheless, micron-thick liquid sheets routinely perforate far above the scale where these molecular forces act, yet the mechanism that selects opening versus healing has remained unclear. Using direct numerical simulations of a draining sheet with an entrained air bubble (cavity), we show that irreversible rupture occurs only when a deterministic double-threshold is crossed: (i) the outward driving (from airflow or inertia) is strong enough and (ii) the cavity is distorted enough. If either condition falls short, surface tension heals the cavity and the sheet reseals. The time for this process is set by the balance between inertia and viscosity -- fast for inertia-dominated sheets and slower for viscous ones. This double-threshold mechanism explains why micrometer-thick films perforate and offers practical control options -- driving strength and defect geometry -- for predicting and controlling breakup in spray formation processes, wave breaking, and respiratory films.

Spatiotemporally Resolved Measurements of CO2 Distribution at the Air-Water Interface Using Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscopy
Dongfang Zhao, Yumin Shi, Shengkai Wang
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The transport of CO2 across the air-water interface is central to physical oceanography and carbon sequestration. A comprehensive understanding of this process requires high-resolution diagnostics of diffusion, absorption, and reaction across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The current study presents a novel measurement method to quantify the CO2 distribution at the air-water interface. This method combines the advantages of tunable diode laser spectroscopy and rapid spatial beam scanning for in situ, nonintrusive, and spatiotemporally resolved measurement of the CO2 concentration distribution above the interface. The performance of this method was examined in a series of quasi-1D experiments in a miniature gas chamber, where the diffusion and absorption of CO2 into pure water and alkaline solutions of different pH values were continuously monitored. An effective time resolution of 5 ms and an effective spatial resolution of 1 mm were achieved. The observed gas-phase CO2 distribution evolution agreed with the classic one-dimensional diffusion model, which validated the accuracy of the current method. PH-dependent dynamics of interfacial CO2 concentration were also observed. The CO2 depletion rate is highly pH-sensitive at low pH and saturates at pH = 10, revealing complex competition between the gas-phase and the liquid-phase transport processes. The current method's high spatial and temporal resolution holds promise for studying cross-interface gas transport under more complex flow conditions, in both field measurements and laboratory studies.

Super resonance: Breaking the bandwidth limit of resonant modes and its application to flow control

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We report the discovery of super resonance--a new regime of resonant behavior in which a mode's out-of-phase response persists far beyond its classical bandwidth. This effect emerges from a coiled phononic structure composed of a locally resonant elastic metamaterial and architected to support multiple internal energy pathways. These pathways converge at a single structural location, enabling extended modal dominance and significantly broadening the frequency range over which a resonant phase is sustained. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations the implications of this mechanism in the context of flow instability control, where current approaches are inherently constrained by the characteristically narrow spectral bandwidth of conventional resonances. Using a super-resonant phononic subsurface structure interfacing with a channel flow, we show passive simultaneous suppression of four unstable flow perturbations across a frequency range more than five times wider than that is achievable with a standard resonance in an equivalent uncoiled structure. By enabling broadband, passive control of flow instabilities, super resonance overcomes a longstanding limitation in laminar flow control strategies. More broadly, it introduces a powerful new tool for phase-engineered wave-matter interaction. The ability to preserve out-of-phase modal response across wide spectral ranges establishes a fundamental advance in the physics of resonance, with far-reaching implications for suppressing fully developed turbulent flows and beyond.

The Full Flow Purifier for Fermilab's Muon Campus uses a charcoal bed surrounded by a liquid nitrogen jacket to purify up to 240 g/s of helium gas. Fabrication by Ability Engineering Technology Inc. has been completed and the purifier delivered to Fermilab. It is the largest purifier to be used at Fermilab based on both capacity and size. A previous paper discussed the design of purifier for various operational conditions and horizontal shipping. The purifier is designed to withstand 5g force in vertical and 2g force in lateral and longitudinal directions. Transportation experience from vendor to Fermilab and within site is discussed. Integration of the purifier involved design and fabrication of a liquid nitrogen transfer line, regeneration system, and helium piping to connect it to Muon Campus cryogenic system. It also involved establishing electrical, instrumentation and controls connections to the system. Integration of the purifier is discussed in detail. The purifier is to be commissioned using up to 4 MYCOM helium compressors to supply helium and liquid nitrogen supplied by a 60,000-liter tank. Actual effectiveness of the 3-stream heat exchanger is to be estimated based on measured temperatures and flow rate. Impurity levels will be monitored at inlet and outlet of the purifier. Theoretical adsorption capacity of the purifier is calculated based on the measured temperatures and flowrates and is compared to actual adsorption capacity over time.

Mitigating Source and Detection Noises in Auto-correlative Weak-Value Amplification

Weak-value amplification (WVA) is a post-selection-based technique that amplifies weak physical signals by preparing nearly orthogonal pre- and post-selected quantum states. It is intrinsically limited by various kinds of technical noise, which distorts amplified weak values, especially when discarding photons in post-selection. While prior work established the efficacy of auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) under Gaussian noise, practical implementations face challenges from band-limited laser-source noise and detection noise. Here, we demonstrate that the AWVA protocol robustly suppresses both laser-power fluctuations and detection noise. Numerical experiments in Simulink further reveal AWVA dual advantage. Under high-power conditions, the noise-reduction superiority of AWVA over WVA becomes increasingly pronounced as input laser power increases. In detection-limited regimes, AWVA achieves an order-of-magnitude lower uncertainty, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao bound. This work demonstrates that AWVA improves precision in both high-power laser-noise-dominated and photon-starved regimes, thereby bridging these operating extremes and advancing precision in applications from gravitational-wave detection to hybrid quantum systems.

Markovian Embedding of Nonlinear Memory via Spectral Representation

Subjects:

Differential equations containing memory terms that depend nonlinearly on past states model a variety of non-Markovian processes. In this study, we present a Markovian embedding procedure for such equations with distributed delay by utilising an exact spectral representation of the nonlinear memory function. This allows us to transform the nonlocal system to an equivalent local-in-time system in an abstract extended space. We demonstrate our embedding procedure for two one-dimensional physical models: (i) the walking droplet and (ii) the single-phase Stefan problem. In addition to providing an alternative representation of the underlying physical system, the local representation finds applications in designing efficient time-integrators with time-independent computational costs for memory-dependent systems which typically suffer from growing-in-time costs.

We simulate the coherence of two coupled electron spins interacting with a bath of nuclei using the generalized cluster correlation expansion (gCCE) method. An exchange interaction between the electrons facilitates a family of entangling gates that can be spoiled by nuclear-induced dephasing. Consequently, we study the dephasing of the coherent two-electron system by characterizing the $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ of the two-electron reduced density matrix for various system parameters in the range mimicking magnetic molecules, including magnetic field strength and orientation, exchange interaction strength, distance between the two spins, minimum distance between electron and nuclei and between nuclei, and nuclei density. We find the optimal regime for each parameter in which the coherence time is maximized and provide a physical understanding of it.

Biologically-inspired computing models have made significant progress in recent years, but the conventional von Neumann architecture is inefficient for the large-scale matrix operations and massive parallelism required by these models. This paper presents Spin-NeuroMem, a low-power circuit design of Hopfield network for the function of associative memory. Spin-NeuroMem is equipped with energy-efficient spintronic synapses which utilize magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) to store weight matrices of multiple associative memories. The proposed synapse design achieves as low as 17.4% power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art synapse designs. Spin-NeuroMem also encompasses a novel voltage converter with a 53.3% reduction in transistor usage for effective Hopfield network computation. In addition, we propose an associative memory simulator for the first time, which achieves a 5Mx speedup with a comparable associative memory effect. By harnessing the potential of spintronic devices, this work paves the way for the development of energy-efficient and scalable neuromorphic computing systems.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We consider a simplified extensible version of a dynamic free boundary problem for a thin filament with radius $\epsilon>0$ immersed in 3D Stokes flow. The 3D fluid is coupled to the quasi-1D filament dynamics via a novel type of angle-averaged Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for the Stokes equations, and much of the difficulty in the analysis lies in understanding this operator. Here we show that the main part of this angle-averaged NtD map about a closed, curved filament is the corresponding operator about a straight filament, for which we can derive an explicit symbol. Remainder terms due to curvature are lower order with respect to regularity or size in $\epsilon$. Using this operator decomposition, it is then possible to show that the simplified free boundary evolution is a third-order parabolic equation and is locally well posed. This establishes a more complete mathematical foundation for the myriad computational results based on slender body approximations for thin immersed elastic structures.

Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for applying postselection techniques to technical noise suppression, realistic quantum imaging and postselected distributed quantum sensing and offers new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.

Surface Acoustic Waves (SAW) have been used in spintronic applications to decrease the magnetic field or the electric current required to act on the magnetization. A common belief is that a SAW alone cannot achieve a directed magnetic switching in a device without an assisting magnetic field or electric current. In this work, we demonstrate magnetic domain wall motion driven solely by an acoustic wave. Using XMCD-PEEM, we show extensive evidence of SAW-induced and field-free magnetic domain wall motion (DW) in the direction of the wave propagation. Our micromagnetic simulations reveal a mechanism that allows the SAW to transfer linear momentum to the DW. Experimentally, the largest DW average velocity measured was ~12 m/s, although our simulations predict that velocities in the range of 100 m/s could be attained. This new mechanism opens the door to designing innovative spintronic devices where the magnetization can be controlled exclusively by an acoustic wave.

We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by this http URL, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.

Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.

Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, available adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been reported to scale poorly in terms of computational cost when applied to high-dimensional problems. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). PACMANN incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the PINN loss function, that is, the squared PDE residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration into existing physics-informed neural network pipelines. The code is available at this https URL.

We present a novel machine learning (ML) method to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding techniques are computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\infty $ errors of $ 4.54 \times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the NNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with mixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to traditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT engine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than a traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of 1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the Delta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for TensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8 million data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with increasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed, enabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work underscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model quantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations.

Understanding the mechanisms driving the distribution of scientific citations is a key challenge in assessing the scientific impact of authors. We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analysing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset and two Scopus-based datasets, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indices, such as the h-index. Our results confirm the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches.

The simulation of sand--water mixtures requires capturing the stochastic behavior of individual sand particles within a uniform, continuous fluid medium, such as the characteristic of migration, deposition, and plugging across various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Granule-in-Cell (GIC) method for simulating such sand--water interaction. We leverage the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the fine-scale details of individual granules and the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for its continuous spatial representation and particle-based structure for density projection. To combine these two frameworks, we treat granules as macroscopic transport flow rather than solid boundaries for the fluid. This bidirectional coupling allows our model to accommodate a range of interphase forces with different discretization schemes, resulting in a more realistic simulation with fully respect to the mass conservation equation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulating complex sand--water interactions, while maintaining volume consistency. Notably, in the dam-breaking experiment, our simulation uniquely captures the distinct physical properties of sand under varying infiltration degree within a single scenario. Our work advances the state of the art in granule--fluid simulation, offering a unified framework that bridges mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics.

We present QuantumToolbox$.$jl, an open-source Julia package for simulating open quantum systems. Designed with a syntax familiar to users of QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python), it harnesses Julia's high-performance ecosystem to deliver fast and scalable simulations. The package includes a suite of time-evolution solvers supporting distributed computing and GPU acceleration, enabling efficient simulation of large-scale quantum systems. We also show how QuantumToolbox$.$jl can integrate with automatic differentiation tools, making it well-suited for gradient-based optimization tasks such as quantum optimal control. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing frameworks. With its flexible design and computational efficiency, QuantumToolbox$.$jl serves as a powerful tool for both theoretical studies and practical applications in quantum science.

Levitation of macroscopic objects in a vacuum is key towards the development of high-precision inertial sensors and pressure sensors, as well as towards the fundamental studies of quantum mechanics and its relation to gravity. Diamagnetic levitation offers a passive method at room temperature to isolate macroscopic objects in vacuum environments, yet eddy current damping remains a critical limitation for electrically conductive materials. We show that there are situations where the motion of conductors in magnetic fields does not, in principle, produce eddy damping, and demonstrate an electrically conducting rotor diamagnetically levitated in an axially symmetric magnetic field in a high vacuum. Experimental measurements and finite-element simulations reveal gas collision damping as the dominant loss mechanism at high pressures, while residual eddy damping, which arises from symmetry-breaking factors such as platform tilt or material imperfections, dominates at low pressures. The conclusion is supported by an analytic proof and an analytic example of zero steady current density for a rotating conductor in a magnetic field. This demonstrates a macroscopic levitated rotor with extremely low rotational damping and paves the way to fully suppress rotor damping, enabling ultra-low-loss rotors for gyroscopes, pressure sensing, and fundamental physics tests.

Large language models (LLMs) are used worldwide, yet exhibit Western cultural tendencies. Many countries are now building ``regional'' LLMs, but it remains unclear whether they reflect local values and practices or merely speak local languages. Using India as a case study, we evaluate six Indic and six global LLMs on two dimensions -- values and practices -- grounded in nationally representative surveys and community-sourced QA datasets. Across tasks, Indic models do not align better with Indian norms than global models; in fact, a U.S. respondent is a closer proxy for Indian values than any Indic model. Prompting and regional fine-tuning fail to recover alignment and can even degrade existing knowledge. We attribute this to scarce culturally grounded data, especially for pretraining. We position cultural evaluation as a first-class requirement alongside multilingual benchmarks and offer a reusable, community-grounded methodology. We call for native, community-authored corpora and thick x wide evaluations to build truly sovereign LLMs.

Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light

We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fröhlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.

Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode

Subjects:

Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to high remnant polarization compared with Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 and doped-HfO2 material systems, as well as their fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As AlScN films are thinned to 10 nm thickness, coercive field has been shown to substantially increase, which hinders low voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase with scaling and improves ferroelectric performance. Here, we demonstrate robust ferroelectricity in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, the difference in dynamic switching behavior over a decade of frequency was evaluated by applying the KAI model. At frequencies lower than 16.7 kHz, the capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents of 0.030 and 0.028, indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent of 0.063, indicating a stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.030, suggesting a lower frequency dependence during faster switching scenarios. The Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction technique was selected to measure the strain difference in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, providing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain and switching behavior in ultra-thin film systems.

Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques

The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.

Novel coincidence detection technique for precision measurement of neutron-capture-induced nuclear recoils

The lattice dynamics following particle interactions remain not fully understood, and effects from nuclear-recoil interactions in conventional solid-state detectors - such as defect formation - can hinder accurate event-energy interpretation. Neutron capture $(n,\gamma)$ can produce detectable, precise-energy nuclear recoils for detector calibration and solid-state physics studies. This paper proposes a first-of-its-kind experiment to measure the twin products of neutron capture - the postcapture deexcitation gamma and postcapture nuclear recoil. Simulations show that with a 1 mCi californium neutron source, a positive measurement with existing detector technologies is possible in 26.1 gram-days of exposure.

Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs Bézier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.

Planted Solutions in Quantum Chemistry: Generating Non-Trivial Hamiltonians with Known Ground States

Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.

A fundamental reform has been introduced in the 2024/25 season of club competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA): the well-established group stage has been replaced by an incomplete round-robin format. In this format, the 36 teams are ranked in a single league table, but play against only a subset of the competitors. While this innovative change has highlighted that the incomplete round-robin tournament is a reasonable alternative to the standard design of allocating the teams into round-robin groups, the characteristics of the new format remain unexplored. Our paper contributes to this topic by using simulations to compare the uncertainty generated by the draw in the old format with that in the new format of the UEFA Champions League. We develop a method to break down the impact of the 2024/25 reform into various components for each team. The new format is found to decrease the overall effect of the draw. However, this reduction can mainly be attributed to the inaccurate seeding system used by UEFA. If the teams are seeded based on their actual strengths, the impact of the draw is about the same in a tournament with an incomplete round-robin league or a group stage.

We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max >= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.

We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.

Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on diabetes pathophysiology.
