Title:
A unified relativistic path integral origin for noise-activated collapse and decoherence
Wei Wen
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Relativity and quantum mechanics are two cornerstones of modern physics, yet their unification within a single-particle path integral and a dynamical account of quantum measurement remain unresolved. Here we show that these puzzles are linked. We construct a relativistic path integral that, from a single action principle, recovers the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, and Schrödinger equations, while also exposing a latent nonlocal term in the propagator. This term dormant in differentiable potentials but is activated by non-differentiable noise, driving outcome probabilities through bounded-martingale stochastic process. In this regime, the pointer basis emerges as absorbing boundaries, Born's rule arises from first-passage statistics, and collapse occurs in finite, parameter-dependent time, thereby reducing measurement axioms to dynamical consequences. Crucially, our work recovers the standard GKSL master equation by averaging over the stochastic record, and thus provides a first-principles foundation for decoherence. Because the trigger is the noise spectrum, our work shows that engineering ``colored'' noise can expedite or steer collapse, suggesting practical routes to fast qubit reset, preserved coherence, and quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit.

Title:
Resolution-Scale Relativity signatures in the orbital periods of extra-solar planetary systems

Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
Resolution-Scale Relativity suggests quantum-like dynamics may emerge in chaotic macroscopic systems. In planetary systems, this would lead to orbital periods being proportional to cubed integers $n$. Each system is then characterized by a fundamental speed corresponding to orbital $n=1$. Fitting this model to data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive for 115 planetary systems with four or more planets leads to identifying 38 systems (33\%) complying with an accuracy such that the null hypothesis accidental probability is less than $10^{-2}$, and 16 (14\%) with less than $10^{-3}$. Additionally, 34 systems (29\%) follow a pattern of consecutive quantum-like integer numbers, and 101 (88\%) in which at least half of the quantum-like numbers are part of consecutive sequences. The distribution of fundamental speeds extends from $\sim 100\,\rm km/s$ to more than $1,200\,\rm km/s$ and can be described in terms of a few peaks centered on integer multiple of a super-fundamental speed $v_0=(218.0\pm4.7)\,\rm km/s$. These results along side with other observations in turbulent fluid dynamics amount to a shift to a higher gear in the search for macro-quantization effects.

Title:
The Aharonov-Bohm effect: reality and folklore
Henrique Gomes

History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) effect has been a major focus of the foundations of physics. And yet, much confusion persists. In particular, the effect purportedly leads to a dilemma: on one horn, we have a non-local action of a gauge-invariant quantity on charged particles; on the other, we get a local action on these particles, but of a non-gauge invariant quantity. This is the folklore, but the folklore is filled with misconceptions. Here, by deploying a recently defended formulation of gauge theory that dispenses with principal bundles, gauge potentials, and explicit gauge symmetries, I argue, with previous authors, that the A-B effect can be understood gauge-independently. But here my argument will go further: I will show that the A-B effect, when expressed in terms of the covariant derivative of a vector bundle, is \emph{entirely} analogous to the holonomy of spacetime vectors, and can be understood completely locally. The only surprising idea illustrated by the A-B effect is that, in some circumstances, there is more to the covariant derivative than can be accounted for by the curvature and underlying topology of a vector bundle.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In this study, we investigate the clustering of 5000 droplets, each originating from one of five distinct droplet classes, each representing a unique geometry. The shape coordinates of the droplets are mapped to a 2D latent space through a two-step, fully reversible process involving Fourier series and autoencoders. Thus, each droplet contour sampled by 400 points is represented by 2 scalar numbers. We present data mapping 5000 droplets in two-dimensional space, which reveals ringlike clusters. Each cluster corresponds to a distinct droplet class, with the classification based on the droplet morphology, which is known a priori. Further, we find that well-known clustering algorithms like DBSCAN show limited success in identifying these ring-shaped clusters underscoring the need to explore alternative clustering approaches, particularly those tailored to handle ring-shaped distributed data.

Broadband High-Temperature Multilayer Pyramid-Shaped Metamaterial Thermal Absorber for Thermophotovoltaic applications
Bibekananda Nath, Ahmed Zubair
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
A broadband, thermally stable absorber is essential for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems to simultaneously convert solar and industrial waste heat into usable energy to meet growing power demands. Here, we proposed an ingenious polarization-independent truncated pyramid-shaped symmetric multilayer metamaterial absorber in a metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) architecture with almost complete absorption over a broad wavelength range. A total of six structures (W/AlN, Mo/AlN, Ta/AlN, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2, Re/BN) were designed, and the materials were selected based on their lattice matching to prevent delamination at interfaces between layers. The absorption mechanism was studied at room temperature using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the structure was optimized through a brute force design approach, which illustrates a best average absorption of 98.2% till 4000 nm and 97.73% till 5072 nm wavelength for the W/AlN structure with metal and dielectric thicknesses of 60 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. Moreover, W/AlN structure exhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles irrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the finite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated temperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around 1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent deformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further analyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly absorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure. Additionally, we determined the effect of the concentration factor, and the operating temperature on the system efficiency by considering the emission loss of the heated absorber.

Title:
Further fundamental bounds on the Hall effect in three-dimensional metamaterials
Christian Kern, Graeme W. Milton
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
We consider the problem of bounding the effective nonreciprocal properties of metamaterials. Recently, significant progress was made by showing that this problem can be reduced to bounding an equivalent reciprocal one and applying a monotonicity argument. Here, we build upon this result and provide bounds incorporating additional information about the metamaterial. Specifically, in the two-phase case, we provide bounds for isotropic metamaterials. In the multiphase case, we provide bounds for uniaxial metamaterials that additionally incorporate the volume fractions. In both instances, the incorporated additional information significantly tightens the bounds. In the two-phase case, we evaluate the bounds by comparing them to the effective properties of hierarchical laminate microstructures. This comparison ultimately leads us to propose a set of conjectured bounds. While our discussion focuses on the Hall effect, our results are more broadly applicable to other nonreciprocal effects in so far as their mathematical description is equivalent. In particular, our bounds apply to the Faraday effect in the quasistatic regime and in the absence of losses and resonances.

Generalized mixed variable-pullback scheme with non-ideal Ohm's law for electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations

In this work, the non-ideal Ohm's law is integrated in the mixed variable-pullback scheme for the gyrokinetic particle simulations. This scheme captures the evolution of the symplectic solution of the gyrokinetic model accurately not only in the MHD limit but also in the electrostatic limit. This scheme also provides a pure symplectic ($v_\shortparallel $) scheme for electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations without causing the traditional cancellation problem in the pure Hamiltonian scheme. Various mixed variable schemes have been comprehensively analyzed for the 1D shear Alfvèn wave problem with kinetic electrons, with the connection to the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme and the symplectic scheme. It is demonstrated that the pure $v_\shortparallel $ form with the non-ideal Ohm's law has comparable performance to the widely used mixed variable-pullback scheme with the ideal Ohm's law. The mixed variable-pullback scheme without Ohm's law is also proposed as a feasible improvement of the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme with minimum modification and considerable performance improvement in terms of a marker number reduction.

Discovery of Sustainable Refrigerants through Physics-Informed RL Fine-Tuning of Sequence Models
Adrien Goldszal, Diego Calanzone, Vincent Taboga, Pierre-Luc Bacon
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.

Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.

An ensemble of Gaussian fields with multifractal statistics for turbulence

20 pages, 6 figures, journal paper
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Obtaining accurate field statistics continues to be one of the major challenges in turbulence theory and modeling. From the various existing modeling approaches, multifractal models have been successful in capturing intermittency in velocity gradient and increment distributions. On the other hand, superstatistical models from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics have shown the capacity to model PDFs of various statistical turbulent quantities as ensembles of simpler stochastic processes. Here, we present an approach that generates field statistics in the form of a characteristic functional by promoting a model for multifractal increment statistics to an ensemble of Gaussian fields. By carefully designing the correlation function and the corresponding weight of each subensemble, we are able to define a functional that exhibits multifractal two-point inertial-range and dissipation-range statistics, and that blends into realistic large-scale behavior. Additionally, the method is capable of producing multifractal statistics with any of the widely used singularity spectra. We characterize the fidelity of our approach through comparisons to literature results from direct numerical simulations. Overall, our framework thereby bridges between three different perspectives to turbulence: superstatistics, multifractals, and functional approaches to turbulence.

Anisotropic momentum distributions due to radiation recoil in relativistic plasmas with electric and magnetic fields
Haidar Al-Naseri
Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with plasma generates radiation accompanied by a recoil force, which can significantly alter the plasma dynamics. In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\circ$--180$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$--360$^\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.

Quantum computing offers the promise of revolutionizing quantum chemistry by enabling the solution of chemical problems for substantially less computational cost. While most demonstrations of quantum computation to date have focused on resolving the energies of the electronic ground states of small molecules, the field of quantum chemistry is far broader than ground state chemistry; equally important to practicing chemists are chemical reaction dynamics and reaction mechanism prediction. Here, we review progress toward and the potential of quantum computation for understanding quantum chemistry beyond the ground state, including for reaction mechanisms, reaction dynamics, and finite temperature quantum chemistry. We discuss algorithmic and other considerations these applications share, as well as differences that make them unique. We also highlight the potential speedups these applications may realize and challenges they may face. We hope that this discussion stimulates further research into how quantum computation may better inform experimental chemistry in the future.

SMILES-Inspired Transfer Learning for Quantum Operators in Generative Quantum Eigensolver

7 pages, 5 figures

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Given the inherent limitations of traditional Variational Quantum Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms, the integration of deep generative models into hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, specifically the Generative Quantum Eigensolver(GQE), represents a promising innovative approach. However, taking the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems. This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially reducing computational resource requirements.

Evolution of phenocopying in a dynamical model of developmental trajectories
Yuuki Matsushita, Archishman Raju
Subjects:
Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Developmental trajectories are known to be canalized, or robust to both environmental and genetic perturbations. However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.

Controls on the ocean response to idealized Antarctic meltwater input

Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Antarctic meltwater is expected to increase throughout the coming centuries and impact sea level, ocean circulation, and the coupled climate evolution. This motivates interest in understanding the ocean response to Antarctic freshwater injection, including potential sources of uncertainty. In this study, we use idealized single-basin ocean simulations with meltwater input to examine the dependence of ocean transport and the timescales of the adjustment of regional sea level patterns on: (a) the model resolution and parameter values such as the mesoscale eddy Gent-McWilliams parameterization and vertical diffusivity, thereby partially addressing structural and parametric uncertainty; and (b) the depth of meltwater forcing, which must be prescribed both in our experiments and in most comprehensive climate model simulations, due to a lack of dynamic coupling with an ice sheet model. We find distinct sea level adjustment timescales and changes in the upper and abyssal cells depending on the depth of input, including a near total shutdown of the abyssal cell which only occurs with meltwater injection at the surface. We additionally demonstrate strong connections between the adjustment of key variables, such as regional sea level, and the background stratification in the control simulation, which depends on the model resolution and parameter values. This indicates that the ocean state and physics substantially influence the dynamic ocean response to ice shelf meltwater, in addition to uncertainty in how ocean models interact with fluxes from ice sheets.

Energy transfer from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves
Xiaofei Shi, Xin An, Vassilis Angelopoulos
Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Large-amplitude slow-mode waves are commonly observed near Earth's magnetopause. Recent observations show that these waves can occur simultaneously with kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves. The amplitude of the ion acoustic waves is enhanced near the magnetic field peaks of the slow-mode wave, suggesting that the slow-mode waves may drive the generation of ion acoustic waves. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a hybrid simulation using observation-based parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that large-amplitude slow-mode waves generate counter-streaming ion beams, which in turn excite ion acoustic waves and relax the ion beams. Our study reveals a clear energy transfer channel from MHD-scale slow-mode waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves.

Computation of the heat capacity of water from first principles
Motoyuki Shiga, Jan Elsner, Jörg Behler, Bo Thomsen
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Water is a unique solvent with many remarkable properties. An example is its exceptionally high heat capacity, which plays an important role in storing and transporting thermal energy, with implications for many processes from regulating the body temperature of living organisms to moderating our climate at the global scale. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the heat capacity of water from first principles, highly accurate computer simulations are required. Apart from a reliable description of the atomic interactions, the presence of light hydrogen atoms necessitates the explicit consideration of nuclear quantum effects through path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. The high computational costs of PIMD simulations, which are even further increased by the need for an extensive statistical sampling of energy fluctuations to determine the heat capacity, can be strongly reduced by replacing first principles calculations with machine learning potentials to represent the atomic interactions. In this study, we use high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) constructed from density functional theory calculations employing the RPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 functionals. To further enhance the computational performance, we introduce a highly efficient PIMD algorithm computing in parallel not only the energies and forces but also the coordinate and thermostat time evolutions. Using this approach, we are able to determine converged data for the heat capacity from a 4 ns simulation employing 128 beads. In particular, for the revPBE0-D3 functional we find excellent agreement with experiment, providing evidence that our approach represents a promising framework for the quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water and aqueous solutions.

When Energy-Efficiency May Not Yield Positive Climate Impact -- The Case of Adaptive Radiative Coolers
Nithin Jo Varghese, Jyothis Anand, Jyotirmoy Mandal
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
The climate impact of building envelopes is often quantified using their energy savings and CO2 emission reduction benefits. However, building envelopes also trap solar and thermal infrared heat, which is dissipated as a direct heating penalty into our warming planet. For static or adaptive envelopes that passively heat buildings by radiatively retaining heat, these two effects are antagonistic. Yet, their net effect remains unexplored. In this study, we compare the emission reductions benefit, and direct heating penalty of two classes of roof envelopes, traditional and adaptive radiative coolers (TRCs and ARCs). Calculations for buildings in different urban climates show that relative to TRCs like cool roofs, ARCs like smart roofs may have a net heating impact on earth well past this century. Thus, despite their relative energy savings and CO2 emissions reductions benefits, adaptive envelopes on roofs have a negative climate impact relative to traditional cooling designs. Our findings are generalizable across climates and a range of building envelopes and call for a rethinking of how sustainability is quantified for building envelopes, and of material and architectural design for buildings.

Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
Control system middle layers act as a co-ordination and communication bridge between end users, including operators, system experts, scientists, and experimental users, and the low-level control system interface. This article describes a Python package -- Controls Abstraction Towards Acclerator Physics (CATAP) -- which aims to build on previous experience and provide a modern Python-based middle layer with explicit abstraction, YAML-based configuration, and procedural code generation. CATAP provides a structured and coherent interface to a control system, allowing researchers and operators to centralize higher-level control logic and device information. This greatly reduces the amount of code that a user must write to perform a task, and codifies system knowledge that is usually anecdotal. The CATAP design has been deployed at two accelerator facilities, and has been developed to produce a procedurally generated facility-specific middle layer package from configuration files to enable its wider dissemination across other machines.

Interfacial interactions significantly alter the fundamental properties of water confined in mesoporous structures, with crucial implications for geological, physicochemical, and biological processes. Herein, we focused on the effect of changing the surface ionic charge of nanopores with comparable pore size (3.5-3.8 nm) on the dynamics of confined liquid water. The control of the pore surface ionicity was achieved by using two periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) containing either neutral or charged forms of a chemically similar bridging unit. The effect on the dynamics of water at the nanoscale was investigated in the temperature range of 245 -300 K, encompassing the glass transition by incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), For both types of PMOs, the water dynamics revealed two distinct types of molecular motions: rapid local movements and translational jump diffusion. While the neutral PMO induces a moderate confinement effect, we show that the charged PMO drastically slows down water dynamics, reducing translational diffusion by a factor of four and increasing residence time by an order of magnitude. Notably, by changing the pore filling values, we demonstrate that for charged pore this effect extends beyond the interfacial layer of surface-bound water molecules to encompass the entire pore volume. Thus, our observation indicates a dramatic change in the long-range character of the interaction of water confined in nanopores with surface ionic charge compared to a simple change in hydrophilicity. This is relevant for the understanding of a broad variety of applications in (nano)technological phenomena and processes, such as nanofiltration and membrane design.

Quantitative Correlation between One-Dimensional Periodically Oscillating Detonation Waves and Two-Dimensional Regular Cellular Detonation Waves
Yunfeng Liu
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The objective of this study is to establish a quantitative relationship between one-dimensional (1D) periodically oscillating detonation waves and two-dimensional (2D) regular cellular detonation waves. Numerical simulations were conducted for stoichiometric hydrogen-air detonation waves using the conservative Euler equations coupled with a single-step overall chemical reaction model. The evolution of both 1D periodically oscillating detonation waves and 2D regular cellular detonation waves was analyzed through flux-vector analysis. The results reveal that the period of forming a 2D detonation cell is equivalent to the period of the 1D periodically oscillating detonation wave. Furthermore, 2D regular cellular detonation waves exhibit two distinct time scales:(1) the collision period of triple-points, and (2) the ignition delay time of the heated gas behind the incident shock wave. These two time scales reach a balance for regular cellular detonation waves. The findings demonstrate that the ignition delay time is the key physical parameter for establishing a direct quantitative correlation between the two systems.

Quantum technologies (QT) are advancing rapidly, promising advancements across a wide spectrum of applications but also raising significant ethical, societal, and geopolitical impacts, including dual-use capabilities, varying levels of access, and impending quantum divide(s). To address these, the Responsible Quantum Technologies (ResQT) community was established to share knowledge, perspectives, and best practices across various disciplines. Its mission is to ensure QT developments align with ethical principles, promote equity, and mitigate unintended consequences. Initial progress has been made, as scholars and policymakers increasingly recognize principles of responsible QT. However, more widespread dissemination is needed, and as QT matures, so must responsible QT. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the ResQT community's current work and states necessary future directions. Drawing on historical lessons from artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, actions targeting the quantum divide(s) are addressed, including the implementation of responsible research and innovation, fostering wider stakeholder engagement, and sustainable development. These actions aim to build trust and engagement, facilitating the participatory and responsible development of QT. The ResQT community advocates that responsible QT should be an integral part of quantum development rather than an afterthought so that quantum technologies evolve toward a future that is technologically advanced and beneficial for all.

We study the opinion dynamics in a population by considering a variant of Kuramoto model where the phase of an oscillator represents the opinion of an individual on a single topic. Two extreme phases separated by $\pi$ represent opposing views. Any other phase is considered as an intermediate opinion between the two extremes. The interaction (or attitude) between two individuals depends on the difference between their opinions and can be positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) based on the defined thresholds. We investigate the opinion dynamics when these thresholds are varied. We observe explosive transition from a bipolarized state to a consensus state with the existence of scattered and tri-polarized states at low values of threshold parameter. The system exhibits multistability between various states in a sizeable parameter region. These transitions and multistability are studied in populations with different degrees of diversity represented by the width of conviction distribution. We found that a more homogeneous population has greater tendency to exhibit bipolarized, tri-polarized and clustered states while a diverse population helps mitigate polarization among individuals by reaching to a consensus sooner. Ott-Antonsen analysis is used to analyse the system's long term macroscopic behaviour and verify the numerical results. We also study the effects of neutral individuals that do not interact with others or do not change their attitude on opinion formation, nature of transitions and multistability. Furthermore, we apply our model to language data to study the assimilation of diverse languages in India and compare the results with those obtained from model equations.

Complex networks are ubiquitous: a cell, the human brain, a group of people and the Internet are all examples of interconnected many-body systems characterized by macroscopic properties that cannot be trivially deduced from those of their microscopic constituents. Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.

The use of materials in particle accelerator applications implies the consideration of physical properties in different environments than usual industrial applications. Cryogenic temperatures, high radiation, medium to high vacuum and high magnetic fields are requirements for which the behavior of materials has to be evaluated. In this lecture, Thermal, Electrical and Magnetic properties are briefly introduced, highlighting the mechanisms governing variation with temperature and magnetic field. Standards and testing methods for different properties are described, illustrated with practical examples. With regard to the characterization of thermal properties of a material, testing methods of heat capacity and thermal conductivity are described, with details of the main working principle and measurement examples. Determination of electrical resistivity and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) are the main characteristics of electrical properties, together with specific characterization of superconducting materials. Testing magnetic properties deserve special attention; different methods are commonly employed to characterize non-magnetic and magnetic materials. In magnetic metals and ferrites non-linear behavior and hysteresis effects need to be considered in order to assess their suitability for applications or to model material performance.

Light-emitting metasurfaces provide a compact, integrated solution for simultaneous light generation and beam shaping, making them a promising candidate for advanced photonic applications. However, existing approaches for tailoring far-field emission patterns primarily operate in the spontaneous emission regime, where low coherence limits precise light control. Here, we present a light-emitting metasurface system with holographic lasing output, composed of a binary-structured metasurface integrated with a gain medium, that enables coherent light generation and precise beam shaping of the output lasing emission. With a compact footprint, low lasing threshold, and wide field of view, our system offers an exceptional platform for generating arbitrarily-structured lasing light, with significant potential for miniaturized optical systems.

This study constructs a fully data-driven and reproducible Southeast Asia Influence Index (SAII v3) to reduce bias from expert scoring and subjective weighting while mapping hierarchical power structures across the eleven ASEAN nations. We aggregate authoritative open-source indicators across four dimensions (economic, military, diplomatic, socio-technological) and apply a three-tiered standardization chain quantile-Box-Cox-min-max to mitigate outliers and skewness. Weights are obtained through equal-weight integration of Entropy Weighting Method (EWM), CRITIC, and PCA. Robustness is assessed via Kendall's tau, +/-20% weight perturbation, and 10,000 bootstrap iterations, with additional checks including +/-10% dimensional sensitivity and V2-V3 bump chart comparisons. Results show integrated weights: Economy 35-40%, Military 20-25%, Diplomacy about 20%, Socio-Technology about 15%. The regional landscape exhibits a one-strong, two-medium, three-stable, and multiple-weak pattern: Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia lead, while Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam form a mid-tier competitive band. V2 and V3 rankings are highly consistent (Kendall's tau = 0.818), though small mid-tier reorderings appear (Thailand and the Philippines rise, Vietnam falls), indicating that v3 is more sensitive to structural equilibrium. ASEAN-11 average sensitivity highlights military and socio-technological dimensions as having the largest marginal effects (+/-0.002). In conclusion, SAII v3 delivers algorithmic weighting and auditable reproducibility, reveals multidimensional drivers of influence in Southeast Asia, and provides actionable quantitative evidence for resource allocation and policy prioritization by regional governments and external partners.

Subjects:

Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals provides detailed insights into intermolecular bonding by decomposing the total molecular binding energy into physically meaningful components. Here, we develop a neural network EDA model capable of predicting the electron delocalization energy component of water molecules, which captures the stabilization arising from charge transfer between occupied absolutely localized molecular orbitals of one molecule and the virtual orbitals of another. Exploiting the locality assumption of the electronic structure, our model enables accurate prediction of electron delocalization energies for molecular systems far beyond the size accessible to conventional density functional theory calculations, while maintaining its accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by modeling hydration effects in large molecular complexes, specifically in metal-organic frameworks.

This study presents FREDopt, a newly developed GPU-accelerated open-source optimization software for simultaneous proton dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) optimization in IMPT treatment planning. FREDopt was implemented entirely in Python, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration and incorporating fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the FRED code. The treatment plan optimization workflow includes pre-optimization and optimization, the latter equipped with a novel superiorization of feasibility-seeking algorithms. Feasibility-seeking requires finding a point that satisfies prescribed constraints. Superiorization interlaces computational perturbations into iterative feasibility-seeking steps to steer them toward a superior feasible point, replacing the need for costly full-fledged constrained optimization. The method was validated on two treatment plans of patients treated in a clinical proton therapy center, with dose and LETd distributions compared before and after reoptimization. Simultaneous dose and LETd optimization using FREDopt led to a substantial reduction of LETd and (dose)x(LETd) in organs at risk (OARs) while preserving target dose conformity. Computational performance evaluation showed execution times of 14-50 minutes, depending on the algorithm and target volume size-satisfactory for clinical and research applications while enabling further development of the well-tested, documented open-source software.

The recent progress in nanosheet transistors has established two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors as viable candidates for future ultra-scaled electronic devices. Next to reducing contact resistance, identifying good gate dielectrics is a fundamental challenge, as the dielectric/channel interface dramatically impacts virtually all performance parameters. While several promising gate dielectrics have recently been reported, the evaluation of their quality and suitability is often fragmentary and focused on selected important performance metrics of the gate stack, such as the capacitive gate control, leakage currents, reliability, and ease of fabrication and integration. However, identifying a suitable gate stack is a complex problem that has not yet been approached systematically. In this perspective, we aim to formulate general criteria for good gate dielectrics.

Directly switching optical signals outperforms conventional optoelectronic hardware in terms of cost, latency, and energy efficiency, and is expected to address the growing demand for data node capacity driven by the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Therefore, optical circuit switching (OCS) technology has piqued widespread research interest in various technical solutions, including silicon photonics. However, silicon-based integrated OCS remains constrained by challenges such as network performance and port scalability. Here we propose a magneto-optical heterogeneous integrated nonreciprocal OCS (NOCS) network based on a silicon photonics platform, achieving bidirectional full-duplex nonreciprocal transmission by programming reciprocal and nonreciprocal phase shifters. We demonstrate that compared with the existing OCS architecture, NOCS has the advantages of ultra-high reconfiguration speed, large-scale integration compatibility, and bidirectional channel isolation reducing the number of required ports. NOCS could meet the programming speed requirements of the AI backend network, or supports nonreciprocal optical switching applications without multiplexing technology.

To meet the stringent time calibration requirements for the Belle II experiment upgrade, particularly for its large-size KL and Muon Detector comprising tens of thousands of scintillator channels with time resolutions better than 100 ps, we developed a compact and high-speed time calibration system. The system utilizes a laser diode as its light source, integrated with a fast pulse laser drive circuit that employs high-speed switching GaN FETs and gate drivers. A prototype was constructed and rigorously evaluated using scintillators, achieving timing resolutions of about 13 ps for a single calibration channel. Furthermore, internal deviations among calibration channels were analyzed, with most measurements remaining within 250 ps. These results highlight the system's precision, scalability, and suitability for large-scale particle physics experiments.

Cavity-enhanced symmetric second-harmonic generation

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
As one of the two types of backward second-harmonic generation (SHG), symmetric SHG exhibits some physical characteristics and application prospects that are distinct from those of forward SHG. It is generally realized through quasi-phase matching, which imposes more stringent requirements on the poling period and thus presents challenges for domain engineering. Although employing larger poling periods can ease fabrication, it inevitably reduces conversion efficiency, a drawback that can be compensated by using a cavity. In this work, we employed a semi-monolithic cavity to enhance the efficiency of 7th-order symmetric SHG, achieving a measured one-sided conversion efficiency of 7.2 %, which corresponds to a theoretical total efficiency of 14.4 %. This represents an improvement of more than three orders of magnitude compared with the single-pass case. In addition, the nonlinear coefficient of the crystal of ${d_{33}} = 4.8$ $\rm pm/V$ was estimated.

Cell cultures exhibit rich and complex behaviors driven by dynamic metabolic interactions among cells. In this work, we present a model that captures these interactions through a framework inspired by statistical mechanics. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the equilibrium and dynamical properties of a population of cells arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, where each cell is characterized by fluxes of three reactions: glucose consumption ($g$), respiration ($r$), and waste production/absorption ($w$). The system minimizes an energy function influenced by competitive ($J_g > 0$) and cooperative ($J_w < 0$) couplings between cells. Our results reveal three distinct phases: a competitive phase dominated by glucose competition, a cooperative phase marked by ordered waste exchange, and a disordered phase with local-scale cooperation. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics, we demonstrate how initially non-interacting cells can develop effective metabolic interactions, leading to heterogeneous cultures sustained by cross-feeding. These findings are further supported by analytical solutions derived using mean-field approximations. The model provides insights into how environmental constraints and stochastic fluctuations shape community structures, offering a versatile approach to study several emergent phenomena in biological systems.

Vapor condensation is a physical phenomenon that finds application in heat removal systems. The traditional design of these systems involves round tubes but experience shows that this geometry is not optimal for heat transfer. Flattened tubes on the other hand, have been found to offer potential for improvement as their geometry increases the condensation surface, which fosters higher heat transfer rates. However, the effects of tube shape (aspect ratio) and orientation (rotation angle) on film-wise condensation dynamics are not fully understood. In this work, we numerically simulate a model of the condensed vapor layer thickness distribution on the flattened tube inner surfaces taking into account bulk and surface forces (gravity, surface tension, shear stress) for a thin layer of liquid. We consider various configurations of aspect ratios (circular, and AR = 2, 4, and 6) and rotation angles (0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90°). Our simulations allow for an improved understanding of how these geometric parameters as well as their interplay, influence the thickness distribution of the condensate film on the tube's inner surface, and facilitate the identification of configurations that maximize heat transfer efficiency. Considering water as a working fluid, results show a possible heat transfer enhancement of up to 74% compared to the round tube geometry for an aspect ratio of 6 and a rotation angle of 90°.

Optical frequency combs paved the way for fast and compact multi-component optical chemical analysis due to their broadband spectra. Dual-comb spectrometers embody this technology, but their design requires a pair of matched combs, adding complexity to the system. In this study, we propose and implement a scheme for a rapid, compact spectroscopic analyser that operates without moving components, leveraging the tunability and speed of a single quantum walk comb laser. Previously, these combs have been shown to deliver stable, tunable and broadband lasing. Here, a single quantum cascade laser-based comb emitting within the significant molecular fingerprint region of the mid-infrared spectrum was employed in a non-interferometric setup for targeted and non-targeted analysis of various organic solvent vapours. With a time resolution as small as 10 microseconds and a high dynamic range reaching three orders of magnitude in concentration, this approach is suitable for the real-time analysis of chemical kinetics.

Experiments on geostrophic convection: the role of the Prandtl number

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Flows at planetary scales are generally driven by buoyancy and influenced by rotation. Rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RRBC) is a practical and simple model that can be used to describe these systems. In RRBC, thermally induced convection occurs, which is influenced by the constant rotation it experiences. We study RRBC in a cylinder in the geostrophic regime, where the dominant force balance is between Coriolis and pressure-gradient forces. Experiments are performed to assess the dependence of the Nusselt number $Nu$ (efficiency of convective heat transfer) on the Prandtl number $Pr$ (ratio of kinematic viscosity over thermal diffusivity), a relation that is not explored much for geostrophic convection. By using water at different mean temperatures we can reach $2.8\le Pr\le 6$. We study the relation between $Pr$ and $Nu$ at constant Ekman number $Ek=3\times10^{-7}$ (an inverse measure for strength of rotation) for two different diameter-to-height aspect ratios ($\Gamma=1/5$ and $1/2$) of the setup. The corresponding constant Rayleigh numbers (strength of thermal forcing) are $Ra=1.1\times 10^{12}$ and $1\times 10^{11}$, respectively. Additionally, we measure the relation between the Rayleigh number $Ra$ and $Nu$ for $4\times10^{10}\le Ra\le 7\times10^{11}$, $Ek=3\times10^{-7}$ and $Pr=3.7$. It is found that $Nu$ exhibits a significant dependence on $Pr$, even within this limited range. Increasing $Pr$ by a factor 2 resulted in a decrease of $Nu$ of about $25 \%$. We hypothesize that the decrease of $Nu$ is caused by the changing ratio of the thermal and kinetic boundary layer thicknesses as a result of increasing $Pr$. We also consider the anticipated contributions of the wall mode to the heat transfer using sidewall temperature measurements.

We extend a recently developed three-dimensional semiclassical model to study double and triple ionization of Ne driven by infrared laser pulses at various intensities. This model fully accounts for the Coulomb singularity of each electron with the core, as well as for the interaction of a recolliding electron with a bound electron. The model avoids artificial autoionization by employing effective Coulomb potentials to describe the interaction between bound electrons. Using the extended effective-Coulomb-potential for bound-bound electrons (ECBB) model, we compute triple and double ionization spectra. For instance, we compute the distributions of the sum of the final momenta along the laser field of the escaping electrons. Taking focal volume averaging into account, we find very good agreement with experimental results, particularly for triple ionization. Also, we identify the main pathways of triple and double ionization and explain how these pathways give rise to the main features of the triple and double ionization spectra.

Higher-order dynamics refer to mechanisms where collective mutual or synchronous interactions differ fundamentally from their pairwise counterparts through the concept of many-body interactions. Phenomena absent in pairwise models, such as catastrophic activation, hysteresis, and hybrid transitions, emerge naturally in higher-order interacting systems. Thus, the simulation of contagion dynamics on higher-order structures is algorithmically and computationally challenging due to the complexity of propagation through hyperedges of arbitrary order. To address this issue, optimized Gillespie algorithms were constructed for higher-order structures by means of phantom processes: events that do not change the state of the system but still account for time progression. We investigate the algorithm's performance considering the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with critical mass thresholds on hypergraphs. Optimizations were assessed on networks of different sizes and levels of heterogeneity in both connectivity and order interactions, in a high epidemic prevalence regime. Algorithms with phantom processes are shown to outperform standard approaches by several orders of magnitude in the limit of large sizes. Indeed, a high computational complexity scaling $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ with system size $N$ of the standard algorithms is improved to low complexity scaling nearly as $\mathcal{O}(N)$. The optimized methods allow for the simulation of highly heterogeneous networks with millions of nodes within affordable computation costs, significantly surpassing the size range and order heterogeneity currently considered.

Meso-chiral optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles: uncovering hidden chirality
Yuanyang Xie, Alexey V. Krasavin, Anatoly V. Zayats
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Molecular chirality plays an important role in chemistry and biology, allows control of biological interactions, affects drugs efficacy and safety, and promotes synthesis of new materials. In general, chirality manifests itself in optical activity (circular dichroism or circular birefringence). Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have been recently developed for molecular enantiomer separation, chiral sensing and chiral photocatalysis. Here, we show that optical chirality of plasmonic nanoparticles exhibiting strong scattering can remain completely undetected using standard characterisation techniques, such as circular dichroism measurements. This phenomenon, which we term meso-chiral in analogy to meso-compounds in chemistry, is based on mutual cancellation of absorption and scattering chiral responses. As a prominent example, the meso-optical behaviour has been numerically demonstrated in multi-wound-SiO2/Au nanoparticles over the entire visible spectral range and in other prototypical chiral nanoparticles in narrower spectral ranges. The meso-chiral property has been experimentally verified by demonstrating chiral absorption of gold helicoid nanoparticles at the wavelength where conventional circular dichroism measurements show absence of chiral response (gext=0). These findings demonstrate a valuable link between microscopic to macroscopic manifestations of chirality and can provide insights for interpreting a wide range of experimental results and designing chiral properties of plasmonic nanoparticles.

Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

How is climate change altering the global patterns, frequency, and intensity of drought? To investigate this, we analyzed global drought events from 2000-2020 using a composite of hydrological indices ({\Sigma}(ET-P), SSMI, and GRACE-DSI). Our results reveal that near-normal to severe droughts became increasingly widespread after 2014. Unexpectedly, extreme, 100-year return period droughts occurred not only in semi-arid zones but also in high latitude and typically wet regions. The frequency of these rare events increased globally, with durations exceeding 100 days in hotspots like Eurasia. Ecosystem case studies further showed divergent vulnerabilities in carbon and water cycling. These findings underscore an urgent need for region-specific adaptation strategies to enhance resilience against increasingly extreme droughts.

Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.

Velocity model building from seismic images using a Convolutional Neural Operator

Subjects:
Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
The success of building a high-resolution velocity model using machine learning is hampered by generalization limitations that often limit the success of the approach on field data. This is especially true when relying on neural operators for the mapping. Thus, we propose a novel inversion framework that relies on learning to map the velocity model to a seismic image using a Convolutional Neural Operator (CNO), and then we use optimization to invert for the velocity that matches the image. The key to the success of our network is that we use the initial and true velocity models as input in the training, then we invert for the true velocity starting from the initial velocity at inference. Specifically, we first train a neural operator to accurately learn the forward mapping from seismic velocity models to RTM images, using synthetic datasets that include high-frequency structural information. Once trained, the neural operator is embedded into an inversion loop, where its differentiable nature enables efficient gradient computation via automatic differentiation. This allows us to progressively inject high-wavenumber information from RTM images into the background velocity model, thereby improving resolution without the need for traditional adjoint-state solvers. The proposed framework is validated on both synthetic and field data. Results demonstrate that the neural operator generalizes well to real seismic scenarios, maintains high inversion accuracy, and significantly reduces computational cost. This work highlights the potential of neural operators as flexible and scalable tools for efficient, data-driven seismic imaging and inversion.

Pressure shifts in large-amplitude pulsatile shear flow: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids

Subjects:

A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in pulsatile shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight, deformable microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift from pressure-controlled large-amplitude pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.

Radial Variations in Residence Time Distribution for Pipe Flows
Etienne Boulais, Richard D. Braatz
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Suspensions of low-diffusing particles in pipe flows exhibit a difference in age at different radial positions. Particles near the channel walls have higher residence times than the cross-sectional average. We quantify this effect using Monte-Carlo simulations, and show the existence of two different regimes: a "transitional" regime where delay compounds with channel length, and a "far-field" regime where diffusion counterbalances advection. The results presented therein can be used to quantify residence time distributions near the walls of the tube. This effect is important to consider in experiments involving the kinetics of nanometer-scale particles using modern inline analytical tools. This work also provide a radially resolved extension of classical Taylor dispersion results.

The fast volumetric deposition of multi-MeV high current runaway electron (RE) beams constitutes the most critical issue for the ITER tungsten (W) first wall (FW) longevity. Such relativistic electron beams could generate extreme volumetric power densities inside the FW armour which lead to significant vaporization, deep melting and even material explosions, as well as to elevated temperatures at the bond interface with the cooling substrate that could cause rupture and water leaks. Here the thermal response of the ITER FW is modeled with a three-stage, one-way coupled workflow focusing on assessments of the extent of the wall damage and the increase of the bond interface temperature for varying W thickness. Increased W thickness is found to be essential for wall protection against intense RE dissipation events in terms of both W tile damage and cooling system integrity.

Photonic integrated circuits have become essential for meeting the growing global demand for high-capacity information processing and transport. Assessing their radiation tolerance is essential for deploying systems in radiation prone environments - including in space, high-energy particle accelerators, and defense radiation testing facilities - where the performance and compactness of photonic integrated circuits are increasingly advantageous. This work investigates the analog and digital radio frequency electro-optic performance of Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) subject to 10-keV X-ray irradiation, which mimics cumulative ionization effects in space flight. Silicon photonic MZMs serve as excellent exemplars since they are interferometric devices comprised of elements common to many integrated photonic circuits. Under standard bias conditions, the irradiated MZMs exhibited significantly reduced bandwidth, a corresponding eye closure and baud rate dependent increases in the estimated error rate. The observed performance degradation is attributed to total ionizing dose effects which leads to hole trapping at the silicon/silicon dioxide waveguide interfaces as well as fast traps with energies near the conduction band edge. Notably, when MZMs were irradiated with all leads grounded, no radiation sensitivity to the electro-optic response was observed highlighting the importance of testing under standard operating conditions for ground-based radiation testing as well as on-orbit studies. Understanding the radiation induced performance degradation of MZMs and other integrated photonic devices is increasingly important for space and accelerator environments as performance requirements and deployment opportunities increase.

Noise-Induced Limits on Responsivity and SNR for Nonlinear Exceptional Point Sensing
Todd Darcie, J. Stewart Aitchison
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Exceptional points (EPs) have been suggested for ultra-sensitive sensing because the eigenfrequency splitting grows as the nth-root of a perturbation, suggesting divergent responsivity. In ideal linear devices, however, this responsivity gain is reconciled by a matching divergence in the quantum shot-noise floor, so the net signal-to-noise ratio remains unchanged. Recent work has extended this argument to nonlinear devices, such as above-threshold lasers, predicting other divergences at an EP that is shifted by the interplay of noise and saturation effects. Here we analyze a system of two coupled saturable resonators and show analytically that a self-consistent treatment of fluctuation dynamics removes these divergences entirely. Islands of instability arise in the parameter space surrounding the EP due to the coupling of phase noise into the amplitude dynamics, dictating a maximum responsivity and maximum noise that can be experimentally observed. Stochastic Langevin simulations of the full nonlinear system corroborate our analytical results down to zero detuning.

Data-Driven Reconstruction of Significant Wave Heights from Sparse Observations

Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.

Particle Filtering for Non-Deterministic Electrocardiographic Imaging

Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Probability (math.PR); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Applications (stat.AP)
Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) aims to non-invasively reconstruct activation maps of the heart from temporal body surface potentials. While most existing approaches rely on inverse and optimization techniques that may yield satisfactory reconstructions, they typically provide a single deterministic solution, overlooking the inherent uncertainty of the problem stemming from its very ill-posed nature, the poor knowledge of biophysical features and the unavoidable presence of noise in the measurements. The Bayesian framework, which naturally incorporates uncertainty while also accounting for temporal correlations across time steps, can be used to address this limitation. In this work, we propose a low-dimensional representation of the activation sequence that enables the use of particle filtering, a Bayesian filtering method that does not rely on predefined assumptions regarding the shape of the posterior distribution, in contrast to approaches like the Kalman filter. This allows to produce not only activation maps but also probabilistic maps indicating the likelihood of activation at each point on the heart over time, as well as pseudo-probability maps reflecting the likelihood of a point being part of an earliest activation site. Additionally, we introduce a method to estimate the probability of the presence of a conduction lines of block on the heart surface. Combined with classical reconstruction techniques, this could help discriminate artificial from true lines of block in activation maps. We support our approach with a numerical study based on simulated data, demonstrating the potential of our method.

In this work, we propose performing key operations in quantum computation and communication using room-temperature atoms moving across a grid of high-quality-factor, small-mode-volume cavities. These cavities enable high-cooperativity interactions with single atoms to be achieved with a characteristic timescale much shorter than the atomic transit time, allowing multiple coherent operations to take place. We study scenarios where we can drive a Raman transition to generate photons with specific temporal shapes and to absorb, and hence detect, single photons. The strong atom-cavity interaction can also be used to implement the atom-photon controlled-phase gate, which can then be used to construct photon-photon gates, create photonic cluster states, and perform non-demolition detection of single photons. We provide numerics validating our methods and discuss the implications of our results for several applications.

Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal sensors.

We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.

A self-consistent numerical model of internal wave-induced mean flow oscillations in polar geometry

The Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a natural example of wave-mean flow interaction and corresponds to the alternating directions of winds in the equatorial stratosphere. It is due to internal gravity waves (IGW) generated in the underlying convective troposphere. In stars, a similar situation is predicted to occur, with the interaction of a stably-stratified radiative zone and a convective zone. In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry. Here, the coupling between the two zones is achieved self-consistently, and IGW generated through convection lead to the formation of a reversing azimuthal mean flow in the upper layer. We characterise the mean-flow oscillations by their periods, velocity amplitudes, and regularity. Despite a continuous broad spectrum of IGW, our work show good qualitative agreement with the monochromatic model of Plumb and McEwan (1978). If the latter was originally developed in the context of the Earth's QBO, our study could prove relevant for its stellar counterpart in massive stars, which host convective cores and radiative envelopes.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) are central to studies of cosmic expansion, under the assumption that their absolute magnitude $M_B$ does not evolve with redshift. Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus, $\mu_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M_B(z)$, and their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe~Ia) and DES 5YR (435 SNe~Ia), we find that SNe~Ia are consistent with being standard candles within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z \sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$--$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical. Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN~Ia populations.

Non-local mass superpositions and optical clock interferometry in atomic ensemble quantum networks

Quantum networks are emerging as powerful platforms for sensing, communication, and fundamental tests of physics. We propose a programmable quantum sensing network based on entangled atomic ensembles, where optical clock qubits emulate mass superpositions in atom and atom-clock interferometry. Our approach uniquely combines scalability to large atom numbers with minimal control requirements, relying only on collective addressing of internal atomic states. This enables the creation of both non-local and local superpositions with spatial separations beyond those achievable in conventional interferometry. Starting from Bell-type seed states distributed via photonic channels, collective operations within atomic ensembles coherently build many-body mass superpositions sensitive to gravitational redshift. The resulting architecture realizes a non-local Ramsey interferometer, with gravitationally induced phase shifts observable in network-based interference patterns. Beyond extending the spatial reach of mass superpositions, our scheme establishes a scalable, programmable platform to probe the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity, and offers a new experimental pathway to test atom and atom-clock interferometer proposals in a network-based quantum laboratory.

Steady state dynamics of quantum frequency combs in microring resonators

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Optical frequency combs are utilized in a wide range of optical applications, including atomic clocks, interferometers, and various sensing technologies. They are often generated via four-wave mixing (FWM) in chip-integrated microring resonators, a method that requires low optical input power due to the high quality factor of the resonator, making it highly efficient. While the classical properties of optical frequency combs are well-established, this work investigates the quantum-mechanical characteristics of the individual comb modes. We derive simple equations describing the squeezing, second-order correlation and joint spectral intensity (JSI) between the generated signal and idler modes. Even with the resonator's detuning limiting the generation of signal- and idler pairs with significant photon numbers, many still exhibit substantial squeezing and entanglement. It is demonstrated that the design and dispersion characteristics of the ring resonator significantly impact the quantum features of the modes. Depending on the design, it is possible to enhance either the particle or mode entanglement of specific signal- and idler pairs. Thus, our findings enable the optimization for utilizing quantum frequency combs in various applications, including quantum sensing, computing and communication.

Nature of Transonic Sub-Alfvénic Turbulence and Density Fluctuations in the Near-Sun Solar Wind: Insights from Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations and Nearly-Incompressible Models
Giuseppe Arrò, Hui Li, Gary P. Zank, Lingling Zhao, Laxman Adhikari
Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Recent Parker Solar Probe measurements have revealed that solar wind (SW) turbulence transits from a subsonic to a transonic regime near the Sun, while remaining sub-Alfvénic. These observations call for a revision of existing SW models, where turbulence is considered to be both subsonic and sub-Alfvénic. In this Letter, we introduce a new magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of Transonic sub-Alfvénic Turbulence (TsAT). Our model shows that turbulence is effectively nearly-incompressible (NI) and has a 2D + slab geometry not only in the subsonic limit, but also in the transonic regime, as long as it remains sub-Alfvénic, a condition essentially enforced everywhere in the heliosphere by the strong local magnetic field. These predictions are consistent with 3D MHD simulations, showing that transonic turbulence is dominated by low frequency quasi-2D incompressible structures, while compressible fluctuations are a minor component corresponding to low frequency slow modes and high frequency fast modes. Our new TsAT model extends existing NI theories of turbulence, and is potentially relevant for the theoretical and numerical modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas, including the near-Sun SW, the solar corona, and the interstellar medium.

Polarimetry and optical imaging techniques face challenges in photon-starved scenarios, where the low number of detected photons imposes a trade-off between image resolution, integration time, and sample sensitivity. Here we introduce a quantum-inspired method, functional classical shadows, for reconstructing a polarization profile in the low photon-flux regime. Our method harnesses correlations between neighbouring datapoints, based on the recent realisation that machine learning can estimate multiple physical quantities from a small number of non-identical samples. This is applied to the experimental reconstruction of polarization as a function of the wavelength. Although the quantum formalism helps structuring the problem, our approach suits arbitrary intensity regimes.

The periodicity of three-dimensional oscillatory reconnection

Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Oscillatory reconnection is a dynamic, magnetic relaxation mechanism in which a perturbed null point reverts back to equilibrium via time-dependent reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the long-term periodic signal generated by a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic null point, when it is perturbed by a non-periodic driver, for a variety of driving amplitudes. We solve the 3D nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a bespoke numerical boundary condition (a sponge region) that damps wave reflections and thus allows the long-term periodic signal at the 3D null point to be investigated. We observe multiple cycles of the 3D oscillatory reconnection mechanism for the first time. We find that the periodicity is both constant and independent of the choice of driving amplitude. Furthermore, the resultant time-dependent current density at the null point normalized by the driving amplitude is invariant. We extract a single period for oscillatory reconnection at a 3D null point, opening the future possibility of using this characteristic period as a diagnostic tool to reveal indirectly the fundamental plasma properties of 3D null points.

Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong-field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on interactions with single-atoms only, neglecting that under realistic conditions light propagates through the media. This raises two key questions: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media, and under what conditions it can generate observable nonlinear signals? We address these questions by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media using high-harmonic generation as a nonlinear observable. We found that the infrared photon losses, atomic ground-state depletion and atomic ionization, induce decoherence effects which significantly limit the propagation length in the medium, and reduce the harmonic yield by more than two orders of magnitude compared to that produced by coherent laser light. Nevertheless, we establish the conditions under which BSV generated harmonics can be detected. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation in all states of matter.

The ability to process and act on data in real time is increasingly critical for applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, three-dimensional environmental sensing and remote robotics. However, the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in edge devices is hindered by the lack of energy-efficient scalable computing hardware. Here, we introduce a fanout spatial time-of-flight optical neural network (FAST-ONN) that calculates billions of convolutions per second with ultralow latency and power consumption. This is enabled by the combination of high-speed dense arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) for input modulation with spatial light modulators of high pixel counts for in-memory weighting. In a three-dimensional optical system, parallel differential readout allows signed weight values accurate inference in a single shot. The performance is benchmarked with feature extraction in You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) for convolution at 100 million frames per second (MFPS), and in-system backward propagation training with photonic reprogrammability. The VCSEL transmitters are implementable in any free-space optical computing systems to improve the clockrate to over gigahertz. The high scalability in device counts and channel parallelism enables a new avenue to scale up free space computing hardware.

Toward Scalable and Structured Global Station Weather Forecasting

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.

Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.

General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfvénic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfvénic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.

Title:
High-order Multiscale Preconditioner for Elasticity of Arbitrary Structures
Sabit Mahmood Khan, Yashar Mehmani

We present a two-level preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of the elliptic, linear-elastic deformation equation, in displacement unknowns, over domains that have arbitrary geometric and topological complexity and heterogeneity in material properties (including fractures). The preconditioner is an algebraic translation of the high-order pore-level multiscale method (hPLMM) proposed recently by the authors, wherein a domain is decomposed into non-overlapping subdomains, and local basis functions are numerically computed over the subdomains to construct a high-quality coarse space (or prolongation matrix). The term "high-order" stands in contrast to the recent low-order PLMM preconditioner, where BCs of local basis problems assume rigidity of all interfaces shared between subdomains. In hPLMM, interfaces are allowed to deform, through the use of suitable mortar spaces, thereby capturing local bending/twisting moments under challenging loading conditions. Benchmarked across a wide range of complex (porous) structures and material heterogeneities, we find hPLMM exhibits superior performance in Krylov solvers than PLMM, as well as state-of-the-art Schwarz and multigrid preconditioners. Applications include risk analysis of subsurface CO2/H2 storage and optimizing porous materials for batteries, prosthetics, and aircraft.

Quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for building scalable quantum networks, with electro-optics conversion emerging as a promising approach. Recent experiments, however, observe significant quality factor degradation in superconducting microwave cavities when realizing the electro optics transducers. Here, we identify the piezomechanical scattering, where microwave photon loss through phonon radiation into substrate, as a universal dissipation mechanism in these hybrid quantum devices. By establishing a direct analogy to Rayleigh scattering theory, we derive universal scaling laws governing phononic dissipation process. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off that optimizing coherent transduction coupling inevitably increases dissipation, regardless of the configurations of microwave and optical cavities. We propose potential strategies to overcome this challenge. These findings establish piezomechanical scattering as a critical design constraint for quantum transducers and provide insights to optimize their performances toward practical quantum networking.

Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.

Hidden interactions and components in complex systems-ranging from covert actors in terrorist networks to unobserved brain regions and molecular regulators-often manifest only through indirect behavioral signals. Inferring the underlying network structure from such partial observations remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under nonlinear dynamics. We uncover a robust linear relationship between the spectral strength of a node's behavioral time series under evolutionary game dynamics and its structural degree, $S \propto k$, a structural-behavioral scaling that holds across network types and scales, revealing a universal correspondence between local connectivity and dynamic energy. Leveraging this insight, we develop a deterministic, frequency-domain inference framework based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) that reconstructs network topology directly from payoff sequences-without prior knowledge of the network or internal node strategies-by selectively perturbing node dynamics. The framework simultaneously localizes individual hidden nodes or identifies all edges connected to multiple hidden nodes, and estimates tight bounds on the number of hidden nodes. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both topology reconstruction and hidden component detection. Moreover, it scales efficiently to large networks, offering robustness to stochastic fluctuations and overcoming the size limitations of existing techniques. Our work establishes a principled connection between local dynamic observables and global structural inference, enabling accurate topology recovery in complex systems with hidden elements.

Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Weak anharmonicity sensing by single- and two-photon drives

The optical cavity undergoes a quantum phase transition when the strength of a two-photon drive exceeds a critical point (CP), and the great sensitivity of CP in sensing has been recognized. However, these methodologies are customized to sense linear perturbations, and quantum noise is divergent at the CP. Here, we propose a scheme for sensing the weak Kerr nonlinearity in an optical cavity by both single- and two-photon drives, based on the CP for phase transition. We show that the mean photon number around the CP induced by the two-photon drive sensitively depends on the Kerr coefficient in the optical cavity, so that the weak anharmonicity in the optical cavity can be measured sensitively by detecting the mean photon number. Moreover, we demonstrate that the single-photon drive provides an effective way to suppress the quantum noise and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This scheme can be applied to detecting the weak nonlinear interactions in a wide range of optical systems.

Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.

The characterization of nanostructued materials under reactive environments is challenging due to the complexity of the structural motifs involved and their chemical transformations. Global optimization approaches allow predicting stable structures for targeted materials but addressing the configurational and compositional search spaces is both computationally demanding and inefficient, especially when first principles calculations are required. In this work, we implement and evaluate a computationally efficient grand canonical global optimization algorithm able to identify stable structures and chemical states of targeted systems under given reaction conditions (e.g. reactant pressure and temperature). The algorithm leverages an on-the-fly trained machine-learning interatomic potential based on sparse Gaussian Process Regression and the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to reduce the number of first principles energy evaluations carried out during global optimization searches. The \textit{ab initio} thermodynamics framework is incorporated to approximate the Gibbs energy of evaluated candidates, performing environment-aware optimizations over multiple stoichiometries. We demonstrate the computational performance of this approach and its ability to reproduce some literature examples.

We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.

We study the activity of "living" droplets, which confine 1-6 mesoswimmers in 3D using a superhydrophobic substrate. The swimmers induce oscillations of the droplets at their inherent resonant frequencies, regardless of swimmer size and number. In contrast, the droplet oscillation amplitude is strongly affected by crowding, which we successfully model with a new scaling law and show that crowding reduces the speed of the swimmers. These fundamental living matter physics results reveal mechanisms for bio-inspired droplet actuation with implications for mesoscale robotics, fluidics, and sensing.

Solar eruptions may occur at different evolutionary stages of active regions, during which the photospheric motions manifest in various forms, including flux emergence, sunspot rotation, shearing, converging, and magnetic flux diffusion. However, it remains unclear what are the specific roles played by these different motions in leading to eruptions. Here, we employ high resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations to demonstrate how solar eruptions can be initiated in a single bipolar configuration, driven by first shearing and then flux diffusion at the bottom surface. Flux diffusion disperses the photospheric magnetic flux, driving portions of it toward the polarity inversion line (PIL). This process leads to the expansion of core field, enhancing the pinching effect to form the current sheet. When magnetic reconnection occurs within this current sheet, the eruption is initiated, characterized by a rapid release of magnetic energy and accompanied by the formation of a erupting flux rope. Additionally, flux diffusion contributes to magnetic cancellation near the PIL, leading to the formation of a weakly twisted magnetic flux rope prior to the eruption. However, this pre-exist flux rope plays a limited role in eruption initiation, as its spatial position remains largely unchanged throughout the eruption. These findings demonstrate that the primary role of flux diffusion is to facilitate current sheet formation, highlighting the critical role of current sheet formation in eruption initiation.

As a fundamental phenomenon in quantum systems, spontaneous emission constitutes an inevitable source of error, which ultimately degrades the fidelity of quantum logic gates. A successful quantum logic gate needs to operate on the condition that no decay event, such as spontaneous emission, occurs. Such successes can be ensured by post-selection based on syndrome extraction according to the theory of quantum error correction or quantum error mitigation. In this case, the wave function of qubits remains a pure state but is subject to additional influences from spontaneous emission, even without actual decay events. Therefore, such a process must be appropriately described by a modified version of Schrödinger equation for the dynamics conditioned on no-decay. Calculations reveal that this effect must be seriously taken into consideration for the design of high-fidelity quantum logic gates. With respect to realistic experimental conditions, even if the coherence is well preserved, improving the fidelity of manipulating physical qubits requires careful consideration of the subtle influences of decay processes such as spontaneous emission. Specifically, the gate and readout processes in the atomic qubit platform are discussed.

We demonstrate a highly sensitive real-time magnetometry method at two measurement points. This magnetometry method is based on the frequency-division multiplexing of continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance. We use two ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers separated by 3.6 mm to measure a magnetic field. A different bias field is applied to the two NV ensembles to resolve the resonance peak for each ensemble in the frequency space and enables the multiplexed magnetometry at the two points. The sensitivities achieved at the measurement points are $21~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and $22~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$. The proposed magnetometry method can be expanded to include more measurement points and shorter spacing. The capability of real-time measurement at numerous points with short spacing and high sensitivity is beneficial for various applications, including biomagnetic sensing, geophysical research, and material science.

Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton (STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality, connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations, such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.

In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth's core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.

Residual energy quantifies the difference in energy between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in a plasma. Recent observational evidence highlights that fast-mode interplanetary shock waves have positive residual energy, in sharp contrast to the negative residual energy of the turbulence and magnetic structures that constitute the vast majority of fluctuation power in the solar wind at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) inertial scales. In this work, we apply the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to derive an equation for the residual energy of an MHD shock jump as a function of the shock angle, density compression ratio and Alfvén Mach number upstream of the shock. An equation for the cross helicity is similarly derived. The residual energy equation gives only positive values for super-Alfvénic (i.e. fast-mode) shocks. The residual energy and cross helicity of slow-mode shocks and tangential, contact and rotational discontinuities are also determined. A simplified form of the residual energy equation applicable to perpendicular shocks has been verified against residual energy values directly estimated from observations of 141 interplanetary shocks; the equation is found to match well with observations, particularly for shocks with higher density compression ratios and Mach numbers. The use of positive residual energy as a signature for fast-mode shock identification in spacecraft data is briefly considered, and insights from this work relating to compressive fluctuations more generally in the solar wind are discussed.

Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Recent studies of the self-assembly of Langmuir monolayers have revealed novel forms of lateral molecular ordering. Such studies typically involve the use of grazing-incidence synchrotron radiation scattering, and the lateral order manifests itself as distinct diffraction patterns. The more intricate the molecular organization, the more complicated the corresponding diffraction pattern is. To the point where standard analysis, i.e., identifying peak positions and solving the crystal structure, is insufficient to describe the system. In such cases, a physics-based simulation of the diffraction is required. In this article, we present a versatile theoretical framework for simulating complex structural molecular ordering in Langmuir monolayers. We begin by applying the formalism to a simple case of solid-state monolayers and extend the analysis to describe the structural organization in the collapsed state. The applicability of the method is validated through comparison with experimental data collected at the bending magnet synchrotron beamline.

Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 960 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.

The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.

Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.

We supplement the Lorentz transformation $L(v)$ with a new ``Tunneling" transformation $T(v)$. Application of this new operation to elementary quantum mechanics offers a novel, intuitive insight into the nature of quantum tunneling; in particular, the so-called ``Klein Paradox" is discussed.

Title:
Discontinuous transition to shear flow turbulence

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Depending on the type of flow the transition to turbulence can take one of two forms, either turbulence arises from a sequence of instabilities, or from the spatial proliferation of transiently chaotic domains, a process analogous to directed percolation. The former scenario is commonly referred to as a supercritical transition and frequently encountered in flows destabilized by body forces, whereas the latter subcritical transition is common in shear flows. Both cases are inherently continuous in a sense that the transformation from ordered laminar to fully turbulent fluid motion is only accomplished gradually with flow speed. We here show that these established transition types do not account for the more general setting of shear flows subject to body forces. Counterintuitively the combination of the two continuous scenarios leads to the attenuation of spatial coupling and with forcing amplitude the transition becomes increasingly sharp and eventually discontinuous. We argue that the suppression of laminar-turbulent coexistence and the approach towards a discontinuous phase transition potentially apply to a broad range of situations including flows subject to e.g. buoyancy, centrifugal or electromagnetic forces.

Investigating how different ingredients are combined in popular dishes is crucial to uncover the principles behind food preferences. Here, we use data from public food repositories and network analysis to characterize and compare worldwide cuisines. Ingredients are first grouped into broader types, and each cuisine is then represented as a network in which nodes correspond to ingredient types and weighted links describe how frequently pairs of types co-occur in recipes. Cuisines differ not only in the popularity of ingredient types and range of recipe sizes, but also in the structural organization of ingredient-type combinations. By analyzing these networks, we uncover distinctive patterns of type associations that serve as culinary fingerprints. For example, European cuisines typically distribute ingredients across different types, whereas certain Asian and South American traditions emphasize one dominant type, such as vegetables or spices. The essence of these patterns is well captured by the networks' maximum spanning trees, which offer a simplified yet representative backbone for each cuisine. We demonstrate that both these full and simplified network representations enable machine learning models to identify cuisines from subsets of recipes with very high accuracy. Networks of ingredient combinations also cluster global cuisines into meaningful geo-cultural groups, reflecting shared patterns in culinary traditions. More broadly, our study offers novel insights into the structure of world cuisines, enabling data-driven approaches to their characterization, cross-cultural comparison, and potential adaptation.

The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

In Regional Economics, the attractiveness of regions for capital, migrants, tourists, and other kinds of flows is a relevant topic. Usually, studies in this field explore single flows, characterizing the dimensions of territorial attractiveness separately, rarely considering the interwoven effect of flows. Here, we investigate attractiveness from a multi-dimensional perspective (i.e., dealing with different flows), asking how various types of regional flows collectively shape the attractiveness dynamics of European regions. We analyze eight distinct flow types across NUTS2 regions from 2010 to 2018, employing a multilayer network approach. Notably, the multilayer approach unveils insights that would be missed in single-layer analyses. Community detection reveals complex structures that demonstrate the cohesive power of national borders and the existence of strong cross-border ties in specific regions. Our study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of regional attractiveness, with implications for targeted policy interventions in regional development and European cohesion.

Characterization of NBI-driven shear Alfvén waves in the TJ-II stellarator using Mirnov probes and electrostatic potential fluctuation measurements

We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of shear Alfvén waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were carried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate counter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was used to modify the rotational transform (\iotabar) profile leading to the destabilization of a varied set of Alfvén eigenmodes with different frequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the modes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of the poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical tri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A heavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to characterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes in \iotabar, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies, cannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the shielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to estimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfvén continuum for selected cases using \texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable consistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been created, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.

Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Long-Range Systems

Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.

Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.

In the DEAP-3600 dark matter search experiment, precise reconstruction of the positions of scattering events in liquid argon is key for background rejection and defining a fiducial volume that enhances dark matter candidate events identification. This paper describes three distinct position reconstruction algorithms employed by DEAP-3600, leveraging the spatial and temporal information provided by photomultipliers surrounding a spherical liquid argon vessel. Two of these methods are maximum-likelihood algorithms: the first uses the spatial distribution of detected photoelectrons, while the second incorporates timing information from the detected scintillation light. Additionally, a machine learning approach based on the pattern of photoelectron counts across the photomultipliers is explored.

Weyl Spinors with Proto-charges: A Substructure Model for Elementary Particles

Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
We present a conceptual overview of a new substructure model of elementary particles, motivated in part by the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula. In this approach, Weyl spinors endowed with proto-charges generate all known elementary fermions via their conjugate pairs, while bosons arise naturally as composites. The model predicts a new class of massive neutral bosons that serve as dark matter candidates, accounts for the existence of three generations of fermions, and reproduces the SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) symmetry as a low-energy limit. Elementary particles acquire effective masses from internal binding energy, eliminating the need for ad hoc Yukawa couplings. Neutrinos emerge only in left-handed states, gain mass through their substructure rather than chirality mixing. From the simple proposition that elementary particles are Weyl spinors with proto-charges emerges a coherent and comprehensive picture of elementary particles and fields. Experimental implications of the model includes: no proton decay, absence of sterile neutrinos, absence of Majorana neutrinos, and a possible detection of new massive neutral bosons as dark matter.

Rapid muon tomography for border security
Anzori Sh. Georgadze
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.

One of the main challenges in laser micromachining is the complexity of the process development. The available monitoring capabilities are mostly limited to external measurement systems, significantly slowing down this step. We address this limitation by integrating a coaxial dual-comb LiDAR system directly into a laser micromachining station, enabling in-situ, non-destructive 3D profiling without removing the workpiece. The sub-micron raw axial precision of the system, the operation without mechanical delay scanning and a large working range make the system well-suited for profiling a large variety of micromachined structures. By providing in-situ feedback this approach will significantly accelerate laser micromachining process development.

Lifelong Machine Learning Potentials for Chemical Reaction Network Explorations

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Recent developments in computational chemistry facilitate the automated quantum chemical exploration of chemical reaction networks for the in-silico prediction of synthesis pathways, yield, and selectivity. However, the underlying quantum chemical energy calculations require vast computational resources, limiting these explorations severely in practice. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a solution to increase computational efficiency, while retaining the accuracy of reliable first-principles data used for their training. Unfortunately, MLPs will be limited in their generalization ability within chemical (reaction) space, if the underlying training data are not representative for a given application. Within the framework of automated reaction network exploration, where new reactants or reagents composed of any elements from the periodic table can be introduced, this lack of generalizability will be the rule rather than the exception. Here, we therefore evaluate the benefits of the lifelong MLP concept in this context. Lifelong MLPs push their adaptability by efficient continual learning of additional data. We propose an improved learning algorithm for lifelong adaptive data selection yielding efficient integration of new data while previous expertise is preserved. In this way, we can reach chemical accuracy in reaction search trials.

Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) for non-volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar Czochralski growth, a novel method for programming the quasi-monocrystalline growth of low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure uniform crystalline properties across large areas is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.

Achieving atomic resolution in electron microscopy has historically been hindered by spherical aberration, a fundamental limitation of conventional electron lenses. Its correction typically requires complex assemblies of electromagnetic multipoles. Here, we demonstrate that spherical aberration in a cylindrically symmetric electron lens can be fully compensated via interaction with a shaped light field. By analyzing distortions in high-magnification point-projection electron images of optical standing waves, we quantify the spherical aberration before and after light-induced correction. This approach introduces a new paradigm for optical control in electron beam shaping and opens a pathway towards compact and tunable light-based aberration correctors for high-resolution electron microscopy.

A comprehensive reevaluation of the root-mean-square nuclear charge radius is presented for the doubly magic $^{208}$Pb extracted from muonic spectroscopy measurements. By integrating rigorous theoretical quantum electrodynamics calculations, state-of-the-art numerical methods, and a systematic reanalysis of the uncertainties, we reduced the long-standing muonic fine-structure anomaly and improved the goodness of fit by a factor of twenty. The resulting value of 5.5062(5)~fm for a Fermi distribution is fairly consistent with the previously reported muonic spectroscopy value, and three standard deviations larger than the commonly used compilation data, which indicates that the current value and its uncertainty could be significantly underestimated. Attributing the remaining discrepancy to theory errors which can not be rigorously calculated we suggest the rms charge radius with reduced model dependence to be 5.5062(17) fm. This work sets an improved benchmark for charge radius extraction in heavy nuclei and paves a path for systematic reevaluations across the nuclear chart.

Dynamics of an internally actuated weakly elastic sphere translating parallel to a rigid wall

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We analyse the dynamics of a weakly elastic spherical particle translating parallel to a rigid wall in a quiescent Newtonian fluid in the Stokes limit. The particle motion is constrained parallel to the wall by applying a point force and a point torque at the centre of its undeformed shape. The particle is modelled using the Navier elasticity equations. The series solutions to the Navier and the Stokes equations are utilised to obtain the displacement and velocity fields in the solid and fluid, respectively. The point force and the point torque are calculated as series in small parameters $\alpha$ and $1/H$, using the domain perturbation method and the method of reflections. Here, $\alpha$ is the measure of elastic strain induced in the particle resulting from the fluid's viscous stress, and $H$ is the non-dimensional gap width, defined as the ratio of the distance of the particle centre from the wall to its radius. The results are presented up to $\textit{O}(1/H^3)$ and $\textit{O}(1/H^2)$, assuming $\alpha \sim 1/H$, for cases where gravity is aligned and non-aligned with the particle velocity, respectively. The deformed shape of the particle is determined by the force distribution acting on it. The hydrodynamic lift due to elastic effects (acting away from the wall) appears at $\textit{O}(\alpha/H^2)$, in the former case. In an unbounded domain, the elastic effects in the latter case generate a hydrodynamic torque at \textit{O}($\alpha$) and a drag at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$). Conversely, in the former case, the torque is zero, while the drag still appears at \textit{O}($\alpha^2$).

Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.

The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.

The aim of this study is to provide a probabilistic gust analysis for the region of Germany that is calibrated with station observations and with an interpolation to unobserved locations. To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.

Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. In particular, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.

Large eddy simulations of conjugate heat transfer in boundary layers over laser-scanned ice roughness

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Accurate modeling of ice accretion is important for safe and efficient design of aircraft and wind turbine systems. Heat transfer predictions obtained from fluid flow solvers are used as input in ice accretion codes. In glaze ice conditions, freezing rates and resulting ice shapes are highly sensitive to input values of the heat transfer coefficient. Hence, accurate prediction of heat transfer on iced airfoils is crucial for correctly predicting the ice accretion process. In this study, we perform conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations using wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) over surfaces characterized by ice roughness. The results show that WMLES with CHT accurately captures surface temperature distributions and heat fluxes across a range of roughness geometries. For cases considered, large roughness-to-boundary-layer thickness ratios disrupt outer-layer similarity, leading to substantial errors in estimating equivalent sandgrain roughness when applying traditional empirical models based on surface statistics. The simulations further show that local heat fluxes vary significantly across roughness elements due to low thermal conductivity of the solid; in particular, roughness crests exhibit reduced fluxes in contrast to slopes and valleys. Notably, as roughness height increases, wall heat flux at the crest diminishes, even leading to heat flux reversal in some cases, where thermal energy is transferred from fluid to solid. These effects are not captured in isothermal wall simulations, which overestimate the Stanton number, especially at roughness peaks. By enabling calculation of Stanton number using heat flux distributions, not directly available in experiments, the present simulations augment experimental results and highlight the importance of including solid conduction effects for accurately modeling heat transfer over rough, low-conductivity surfaces such as ice.

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
One of the common tasks required for designing new plasma scenarios or evaluating capabilities of a tokamak is to design the desired equilibria using a Grad-Shafranov (GS) equilibrium solver. However, most standard equilibrium solvers are time-independent and do not include dynamic effects such as plasma current flux consumption, induced vessel currents, or voltage constraints. Another class of tools, plasma equilibrium evolution simulators, do include time-dependent effects. These are generally structured to solve the forward problem of evolving the plasma equilibrium given feedback-controlled voltages. In this work, we introduce GSPulse, a novel algorithm for equilibrium trajectory optimization, that is more akin to a pulse planner than a pulse simulator. GSPulse includes time-dependent effects and solves the inverse problem: given a user-specified set of target equilibrium shapes, as well as limits on the coil currents and voltages, the optimizer returns trajectories of the voltages, currents, and achievable equilibria. This task is useful for scoping performance of a tokamak and exploring the space of achievable pulses. The computed equilibria satisfy both Grad-Shafranov force balance and axisymmetric circuit dynamics. The optimization is performed by restructuring the free-boundary equilibrium evolution (FBEE) equations into a form where it is computationally efficient to optimize the entire dynamic sequence. GSPulse can solve for hundreds of equilibria simultaneously within a few minutes. GSPulse has been validated against NSTX-U and MAST-U experiments and against SPARC feedback control simulations, and is being used to perform scenario design for SPARC. The computed trajectories can be used as feedforward inputs to inform and improve feedback performance. The code for GSPulse is available open-source at this https URL.

We developed an advanced computational framework to accelerate the study of the impact of post-translational modifications on protein structures and interactions (PTM-Psi) using asynchronous, loosely coupled workflows on the Azure Quantum Elements Cloud platform. We seamlessly integrate emerging cloud computing assets that further expand the scope and capability of PTM-Psi Python package by refactoring it into a cloud-compatible library. We employed a "workflow of workflows" approach wherein a parent workflow spawns one or more child workflows, managing them, and acting on their results. This approach enabled us to optimize resource allocation according to each workflow's needs, and allowed us to use the cloud heterogeneous architecture for the computational investigation of a combinatorial explosion of thiol protein PTMs on an exemplary protein megacomplex critical to the Calvin-Benson cycle of light-dependent sugar production in cyanobacteria. With PTM-Psi on the cloud, we transformed the pipeline for the thiol PTM analysis to achieve high throughput by leveraging the strengths of the cloud service. \ptmpsi\ on the cloud reduces operational complexity and lowers entry barriers to data interpretation with structural modeling for a redox proteomics mass spectrometry specialist.

Neither molecular kinetics nor continuum fluid dynamics alone is adequate to describe multiscale gas flows across different regimes. Bridging these regimes within a single self-consistent framework has long been a central challenge in fluid mechanics. We propose a unified gas kinetic framework that classifies molecules by their collision histories over an observation timescale. This formulation recovers the Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes equations as limiting cases, providing a transparent connection between kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. Beyond practical advantages for multiscale modeling, this framework offers a new perspective on Hilbert's sixth problem by linking microscopic dynamics to continuum mechanics through a tunable observational scale.

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The large number of degrees of freedom involved in polaritonic chemistry processes considerably restricts the systems that can be described by any ab initio approach, due to the resulting high computational cost. Semiclassical methods that treat light classically offer a promising route for overcoming these limitations. In this work, we present a new implementation that combines the numerical propagation of Maxwell's equations to simulate realistic cavities with quantum electron dynamics at the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory level. This implementation allows for the simulation of a large number of molecules described at the atomistic level, interacting with cavity modes obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. By mimicking experimental setups, our approach enables the calculation of transmission spectra, in which we observe the corresponding polaritonic signals. In addition, we have access to local information, revealing complex responses of individual molecules that depend on the number, geometry, position, and orientation of the molecules inside the cavity.

Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
In this work, using the time-dependent density functional theory, we address the electron tunneling triggered by short (single-cycle and several-cycle) optical pulses in narrow metallic gaps under conditions relevant for actual experiments. We identify photon-assisted tunneling with one-photon, two-photon, and higher-order photon absorption, and we discuss the effect of the tunneling barrier, applied bias, and strength of the optical field on transition from photon-assisted tunneling (weak optical fields) to the optical field emission at strong optical fields. The numerical single-electron calculations and an analytical strong-field theory model are used to gain deeper insights into the results of the time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Additionally, our parameter-free calculations allow us to retrieve and explain recent experimental results on optically induced transport in narrow metallic gaps under an applied dc bias.

Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.

Conceptual design of a Doppler Backscattering diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $\rho$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\sim35^{\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).

Motivated by applications to underwater explosions and volcanic eruptions, this paper considers the evolution of an initial pressure disturbance in the ocean, including effects due to the dynamic and static compression of water and the free surface. In order to solve the equations of motion of a linear compressible ocean, a special inner product is introduced, which allows us to apply self-adjoint operator theory. What results is a Hilbert space in which the acoustic-gravity modes are orthogonal in the generalised sense. This allows the time-domain evolution of the free surface and subsurface pressure field resulting from an initial disturbance to be calculated. Our simulations show initial radial propagation of the pressure pulse and subsequent reflection from the water surface and the rigid ocean floor, eventually leading to horizontal propagation away from the source point. The solutions with and without the inclusion of the static compression are compared, and the effect of static compression is shown to be small but not negligible.

Finding better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems could have a large positive impact on many real-world application areas, such as logistics. For this reason, significant efforts have been made to design novel optimisation paradigms. Here we show an early instance of such paradigm in an optical setting, the entropy computing paradigm. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses optical measurement and feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.

Biomolecular condensates are cellular phase-separated droplets that usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. Condensates usually exhibit a solidification over a long period of time (days), a phenomenon described as this http URL emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic processes, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy maximization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.

Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF. The code is available at this https URL.

The FAIR Universe HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focused on measuring the physical properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators. Participants were required to compute and report confidence intervals for a parameter of interest regarding the Higgs boson while accounting for various systematic (epistemic) uncertainties. The dataset is a tabular dataset of 28 features and 280 million instances. Each instance represents a simulated proton-proton collision as observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. The features of these simulations were chosen to capture key characteristics of different types of particles. These include primary attributes, such as the energy and three-dimensional momentum of the particles, as well as derived attributes, which are calculated from the primary ones using domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, a label feature designates each instance's type of proton-proton collision, distinguishing the Higgs boson events of interest from three background sources. As outlined in this paper, the permanent release of the dataset allows long-term benchmarking of new techniques. The leading submissions, including Contrastive Normalising Flows and Density Ratios estimation through classification, are described. Our challenge has brought together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our understanding and methodologies in handling systematic uncertainties within AI techniques.

Data privacy is a significant concern when using numerical simulations for sensitive information such as medical, financial, or engineering data -- especially in untrusted environments like public cloud infrastructures. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution for achieving data privacy by enabling secure computations directly on encrypted data. Aimed at computational scientists, this work explores the viability of FHE-based, privacy-preserving numerical simulations of partial differential equations. The presented approach utilizes the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, a widely used FHE method for approximate arithmetic on real numbers. Two Julia packages are introduced, OpenFHE$.$jl and SecureArithmetic$.$jl, which wrap the OpenFHE C++ library to provide a convenient interface for secure arithmetic operations. With these tools, the accuracy and performance of key FHE operations in OpenFHE are evaluated, and implementations of finite difference schemes for solving the linear advection equation with encrypted data are demonstrated. The results show that cryptographically secure numerical simulations are possible, but that careful consideration must be given to the computational overhead and the numerical errors introduced by using FHE. An analysis of the algorithmic restrictions imposed by FHE highlights potential challenges and solutions for extending the approach to other models and methods. While it remains uncertain how broadly the approach can be generalized to more complex algorithms due to CKKS limitations, these findings lay the groundwork for further research on privacy-preserving scientific computing.

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.

In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.

The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a set featuring 20 generic reaction templates written in SMARTS, a pattern-based notation designed to describe substructures and reactivity. Additionally, we introduce ProPreT5, a T5-based model specifically adapted for chemistry and, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of directly handling and applying SMARTS reaction templates. To further improve generalization, we propose the first augmentation strategy for SMARTS, which injects structural diversity at the pattern level. Trained on augmented templates, ProPreT5 demonstrates strong predictive performance and generalization to unseen reactions. Together, these contributions provide a novel and practical alternative to current methods, advancing the field of template-based reaction prediction.

COSINUS is a dark matter direct detection experiment using NaI crystals as cryogenic scintillating calorimeters. If no signal is observed, this will constrain the dark matter scattering rate in sodium iodide. We investigate how this constraint can be used to infer that the annual modulation signal observed in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment cannot originate from dark matter nuclear recoil events, independently of the dark matter model. We achieve this by unfolding the DAMA modulation spectrum to obtain the implied unquenched nuclear recoil spectrum, which we then compare to the expected COSINUS sensitivity. We find that assuming zero background in the signal region, a 1$\sigma$, 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$ confidence limit exclusion can be obtained with 57, 130 or 250 kg day of exposure, respectively. A simple background model indicates that in the presence of background, the exposure requirements may increase by $\sim30\%$.

The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems - governed by partial differential equations - present unique challenges regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels. As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. We demonstrate significant gains in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better scaling to more complex dynamics. The accompanying code is available under this https URL.

We introduce wifi ensembles as a novel framework to obtain asymptotic frequentist uncertainties on density ratios, with a particular focus on neural ratio estimation in the context of high-energy physics. When the density ratio of interest is a likelihood ratio conditioned on parameters, wifi ensembles can be used to perform simulation-based inference on those parameters. After training the basis functions f_i(x), uncertainties on the weights w_i can be straightforwardly propagated to the estimated parameters without requiring extraneous bootstraps. To demonstrate this approach, we present an application in quantum chromodynamics at the Large Hadron Collider, using wifi ensembles to estimate the likelihood ratio between generated quark and gluon jets. We use this learned likelihood ratio to estimate the quark fraction in a synthetic mixed quark/gluon sample, showing that the resultant uncertainties empirically satisfy the desired coverage properties.

We present a next-generation version of EDIpack, a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. This new release efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity, featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. It provides quick access to dynamical correlation functions on the entire complex frequency plane at zero and low-temperatures. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and w2dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.

Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Optics (physics.optics)
Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. We further propose a training algorithm with single-sample bit-scale optimization.

Multimodal Atmospheric Super-Resolution With Deep Generative Models

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)
Score-based diffusion modeling is a generative machine learning algorithm that can be used to sample from complex distributions. They achieve this by learning a score function, i.e., the gradient of the log-probability density of the data, and reversing a noising process using the same. Once trained, score-based diffusion models not only generate new samples but also enable zero-shot conditioning of the generated samples on observed data. This promises a novel paradigm for data and model fusion, wherein the implicitly learned distributions of pretrained score-based diffusion models can be updated given the availability of online data in a Bayesian formulation. In this article, we apply such a concept to the super-resolution of a high-dimensional dynamical system, given the real-time availability of low-resolution and experimentally observed sparse sensor measurements from multimodal data. Additional analysis on how score-based sampling can be used for uncertainty estimates is also provided. Our experiments are performed for a super-resolution task that generates the ERA5 atmospheric dataset given sparse observations from a coarse-grained representation of the same and/or from unstructured experimental observations of the IGRA radiosonde dataset. We demonstrate accurate recovery of the high dimensional state given multiple sources of low-fidelity measurements. We also discover that the generative model can balance the influence of multiple dataset modalities during spatiotemporal reconstructions.

Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Identifying useful sorbent materials for direct air capture (DAC) from humid air remains a challenge. We present the Open DAC 2025 (ODAC25) dataset, a significant expansion and improvement upon ODAC23 (Sriram et al., ACS Central Science, 10 (2024) 923), comprising nearly 60 million DFT single-point calculations for CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and O$_2$ adsorption in 15,000 MOFs. ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT calculations and the treatment of flexible MOFs in ODAC23. Along with the dataset, we release new state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ODAC25 and evaluate them on adsorption energy and Henry's law coefficient predictions.

Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.

Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder

We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.

Since its inception in 1995, LAMMPS has grown to be a world-class molecular dynamics code, with thousands of users, over one million lines of code, and multi-scale simulation capabilities. We discuss how LAMMPS has adapted to the modern heterogeneous computing landscape by integrating the Kokkos performance portability library into the existing C++ code. We investigate performance portability of simple pairwise, many-body reactive, and machine-learned force-field interatomic potentials. We present results on GPUs across different vendors and generations, and analyze performance trends, probing FLOPS throughput, memory bandwidths, cache capabilities, and thread-atomic operation performance. Finally, we demonstrate strong scaling on three exascale machines -- OLCF Frontier, ALCF Aurora, and NNSA El Capitan -- as well as on the CSCS Alps supercomputer, for the three potentials.

Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.

Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.

Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.

The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111) covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.

The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.

A General Model for Static Contact Angles

Comments:
14 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The problem of contact angle and hysteresis determination has direct implications for engineering applications of wetting, colloid and surface science. Significant technical challenges can arise under real-world operating conditions, because the static contact angle is strongly influenced by contamination at the liquid-solid and liquid-vapor interfaces, chemical aging over long times, and environmental variables such as relative humidity and temperature. Analytical models that account for these real-world effects are therefore highly desirable to guide the rational design of robust applications. This work proposes a unified and simple-to-use model that expands Young's local thermodynamic approach to consider surfaces with topographic features of general geometry and varying degrees of liquid infiltration. The unified model recovers classical wetting limits (Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter, and hemiwicking), accounts for observable intermediate states (e.g., impregnating Cassie), and identifies a new limiting state with potential realizability: a Cassie state accompanied by a precursor film, termed the Inverse Wenzel state.

We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (> 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.

On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions
Manuela Feistl-Held, Peter Pickl
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)
We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|>N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.
