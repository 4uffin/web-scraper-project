Title:
A Wendelstein-7X Profile Database for Informed Transport Studies

To advance the development of future fusion devices beyond Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), a robust understanding of energy confinement time scaling is crucial. Universal temperature and density profile shapes are theoretically anticipated through a comparison of the empirical ISS04 confinement time scaling with predictions based on Gyro-Bohm heat flux scaling. This thesis investigates the presence of these universalities in W7-X experimental profiles and subsequently tests existing confinement time scalings against this data.
Experimental profiles are obtained from Thomson scattering diagnostics. Gradient length scales, defined as the radial derivative of the logarithmic quantity of the investigated profiles, are extracted from these profiles through fitting procedures. These scales serve as boundary conditions for subsequent gyrokinetic flux-tube simulations using the GX code. The simulated heat fluxes are then employed to reconstruct profiles by solving the power balance equation and density evolution.
A comparison of these reconstructed profiles with the averaged experimental profiles reveals that the predicted density profiles are steeper than those measured in the reference dataset. To investigate this discrepancy, additional discharges exhibiting more peaked density profiles, including both high-performance and low-power plasmas, are examined. Furthermore, the ratio of experimental temperature and density scale lengths is incorporated as an input into the simulations, and the resulting simulated heat fluxes are evaluated.
Discrepancies between the simulated and measured profiles are discussed, with potential explanations encompassing particle sources and neoclassical transport mechanisms. This comprehensive approach aims to deepen our understanding of the critical role of profile shape and transport mechanisms in plasma confinement.

Integrative biomolecular modeling of RNA relies on structural refined collections and accurate experimental data that reflect binding and folding behavior. However, the prediction of such collections remains challenging due to the rugged energy landscape and extensive conformational heterogeneity of large RNAs. To overcome these limitations, we applied a FRET-guided strategy to identify RNA conformational states consistent with single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments. We predicted 3D structures of a ribosomal RNA tertiary contact comprising a GAAA tetraloop and a kissing loop using three popular RNA 3D modeling tools namely RNAComposer, FARFAR2, and AlphaFold3, yielding a collection of candidate conformations. These models were structurally validated based on Watson-Crick base-pairing patterns and filtered using an eRMSD threshold. For each retained structure, we computed the accessible contact volume (ACV) of the sCy3/sCy5 dye pair using FRETraj to predict FRET distributions. These distributions were then compared and weighted against experimental smFRET data to identify conformational states compatible with the observed FRET states. Our results demonstrate that experimental transfer efficiencies can be reproduced using \textit{in silico} predicted RNA 3D structures. This FRET-guided workflow, combined with structural validation, lays the foundation for capturing the highly diverse conformational states characteristic of flexible RNA motifs.

Title:
Wake dynamics of a square cylinder while moving upward in quiescent water
Intesaaf Ashraf, Stephane Dorbolo, Neetu Tiwari
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We experimentally investigate the wake dynamics of a square cylinder rising through quiescent water over a range of Froude numbers ($\mathrm{Fr}$). Time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry provides velocity and vorticity fields that enable pressure reconstruction and vortex characterization. Diagnostics based on swirl strength ($\lambda_{ci}$), the Okubo-Weiss parameter ($W$), and a shear-vortex interaction measure ($\Lambda$) reveal that the wake is governed by a persistent pair of counter-rotating vortices rather than by periodic shedding. Circulation exhibits a two-regime dependence on $\mathrm{Fr}$, with a sharp increase below $\mathrm{Fr}\approx 1$ and saturation above this threshold, mirroring entrainment force scaling reported previously. While vortex area remains nearly constant, swirl strength and negative-$W$ regions expand with $\mathrm{Fr}$, indicating that entrainment enhancement arises from intensified rotation rather than an enlarged vortex footprint. These findings provide new physical insight into vortex-free-surface interactions and enrich the understanding of entrainment mechanisms in unsteady wakes, with implications for multiphase flows and the hydrodynamic design of naval and offshore structures.

Introduction: This study uses KV CBCT based Synthetic CT (sCT) generated through Velocity workstation and compare the target and normal tissue doses with Adaptive plan CT doses.
Methods: Thirty head and neck cancer patients undergoing Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) were included in this retrospective study. Initially, patient underwent treatment with the primary plan. After subsequent indications of major changes in patients' physicality and anatomy adaptive CT scans were acquired as per institutional protocol. Both the primary planning CT and the indicative cone-beam CT (CBCT) last acquired before the commencement of the adaptive treatment were imported into Velocity workstation. Rigid and deformable image registration techniques were used for the generation of a Synthetic CT (sCT). Simultaneously replanning was done on re-planning CT (rCT) for adaptive plan execution. The primary plan dose was subsequently mapped and deformed onto the Synthetic CT in Velocity workstation, allowing for a comparative dosimetric analysis between the sCT and rCT plan doses. This comparison was conducted in both Velocity and Eclipse, focusing on dose variations across different organs at risk (OARs) and the planning target volume (PTV). Additionally, dosimetric indices were evaluated to assess and validate the accuracy and quality of the synthetic CT-based dose mapping relative to adaptive planning.
Results: The dosimetric comparison between sCT and rCT stated that Mean dose for OARs and PTVs were found to be similar in the two planning and the level of confidence by using T-statistics. Collaborative research has the potential to eliminate the need of rCT as a standard requirement.
Conclusion: The sCT shows comparable CT numbers and doses to the replanning CT, suggesting it's potential as a replacement pending clinical correlation and contour adjustments.

Waves drive the rise and fall of 2D flows in rotating turbulence

Turbulence follows a few well-known organizational principles, rooted in conservation laws. One such principle states that a system conserving two sign-definite invariants self-organizes into large-scale structures. Ordinary three-dimensional turbulence does not fall within this paradigm. However, when subject to rotation, 3D turbulence is profoundly altered: rotation produces 3D inertial waves, while also sustaining emergent two-dimensional structures and favoring domain-scale flows called condensates. This interplay raises a fundamental question: why and when are 2D flows sustained even when only 3D waves are excited? Using extensive numerical simulations of the rotating 3D Navier-Stokes equations together with a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory, we show that near-resonant interactions between 3D waves and a large-scale 2D flow impose an additional conservation law: inertial waves must conserve their helicity separately for each helicity sign. This emergent sign-definite invariant constrains the waves to transfer their energy to large-scale 2D motions. However, as rotation increases, resonance conditions become more restrictive and the energy transfer from 3D to 2D progressively vanishes, leading to a transition from condensate-dominated turbulence to pure inertial-wave turbulence for the 3D modes. We derive analytical expressions for this 3D-2D energy transfer as a function of rotation, Reynolds number and domain geometry, and verify them numerically. Together, these results establish a mechanism underlying two-dimensionalization in rotating turbulence, and, more broadly, illustrate how wave-mean flow interactions can drive large-scale self-organization.

Studying plasma dynamics is crucial for understanding processes like inertial confinement fusion, material damage, and shockwave formation from intense laser or current interactions. While pump-probe methods are standard for capturing these dynamics, single-shot experiments using high-power, low-repetition-rate systems with custom targets are challenging. We present a novel imaging technique using a synchronized GHz-rate spectrally tagged probe laser to capture multiple time-resolved snapshots from a single pump event.

Towards RGB Combiner for AR/VR applications on AlOx
Vahram Voskerchyan
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Aluminum oxide (AlOx) offers low optical loss and high transparency in the visible spectrum, making it a promising material for integrated photonics in display technologies such as augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) and glassless 3D displays. This paper explores the development of an RGB beam combiner on an aluminum oxide platform, leveraging Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM) and multimode interference (MMI) structures to manipulate light intensity and achieve precise color control. The combiner design incorporates wavelength-specific gratings to radiate red (635 nm), green (520 nm), and blue (452 nm) light into far field at an exact propogation angle. MZMs control the intensity of each wavelength, allowing dynamic color tuning by modulating the beam interference. This signal can serve as the basis for a pixel building block in display technologies, offering flexible color manipulation at the pixel level.

Accurate dose calculation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is essential for modern proton treatment planning workflows, particularly when accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes in adaptive treatment scenarios. Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality limitations, requiring complex correction workflows. This study develops and validates a deep learning approach for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT images using extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) neural networks. A retrospective dataset of 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning CT and treatment CBCT images was used to train an xLSTM-based neural network (CBCT-NN). The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and beam's-eye-view sequence modelling to capture spatial dependencies in proton dose deposition patterns. Training utilized 82,500 paired beam configurations with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses. Validation was performed on 5 independent patients using gamma analysis, mean percentage dose error assessment, and dose-volume histogram comparison. The CBCT-NN achieved gamma pass rates of 95.1 $\pm$ 2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria. Mean percentage dose errors were 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4% in high-dose regions ($>$90% of max dose) and 5.9 $\pm$ 1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent preservation of target coverage metrics (Clinical Target Volume V95% difference: -0.6 $\pm$ 1.1%) and organ-at-risk constraints (parotid mean dose difference: -0.5 $\pm$ 1.5%). Computation time is under 3 minutes without sacrificing Monte Carlo-level accuracy. This study demonstrates the proof-of-principle of direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM neural networks. The approach eliminates traditional correction workflows while achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for adaptive protocols.

Impact of Heterogeneity on Scalar Flux Variance Relations Across Diverse Ecosystems

Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Traditional surface layer theory to understand the behavior, scaling and exchange of heat, water vapor and carbon dioxide between the land surface and atmosphere relies on a number of commonly broken assumptions. In particular, traditional theory breaks down under three different forms of heterogeneity highlighted in this work: spatial heterogeneity in the sources of the scalars, heterogeneity in the Reynolds stress tensor (turbulence anisotropy), and temporal heterogeneity (non-stationarity). The work explores the relationship between the idealized flux-variance relations and these three forms of heterogeneity across a diverse network of 47 flux towers representing a broad range of ecosystems including forests, agricultural land, grasslands, tundra, tropical and arid: the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). Results use high resolution spatial data (1 meter resolution) to show a direct relationship between spatial heterogeneity and deviation from traditional scaling relations. Prior work indicates a close relationship between turbulence anisotropy and velocity scaling. A similar result shows weaker, albeit significant differences in the surface layer scaling for all three variables under both stable and unstable stratification based on turbulence anisotropy. The study also indicates an interplay between stationarity and anisotropy, with the non-dimensionalized scalar variance scaling more strongly with anisotropy under more non-stationary turbulence. Updated flux-variance relations that leverage turbulence anisotropy for the scaling of temperature are introduced, as are novel anisotropy-generalized scalings for water vapor and carbon dioxide. The novel scalings show significant improvement over traditional relations. The work also explores in detail how the scaling relations, and their relationship with heterogeneity, vary across the diverse sites in the NEON network.

Optics (physics.optics)
Many modern sensing, processing, and fabrication technologies depend upon the sequential scanning of laser light. Due to inertial, thermal, and electrical limitations, the speed of a typical laser deflector is inversely related to its optical invariant and therefore the number of resolvable spots it can address. Passive optical systems have been developed that can effectively double the optical invariant and maximum throughput of a single deflector. We present a method for increasing the effective optical invariant beyond 2$\times$ by repeated relaying of the deflected beam onto the deflector in an optical loop created within a cavity. We use this Relayed-Loop Optically Amplified Deflection (ReLOAD) approach to accomplish 8$\times$ amplification of electro-optical (EO) deflection, a deflection technology with unparalleled speed, but limited optical invariant. Using ReLOAD, we demonstrate 10 kHz frame rate imaging, 1 MHz line scan rate, and $\mu$s step times across an addressable space well beyond the capabilities of typical electro-optical deflectors.

Tunable photonic crystals explained via Mie theory and discrete dipole approximation: a different light

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
A novel hybrid method based on Mie theory and the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) was developed to study the microscopic parameters governing the optical response of tunable photonic crystals (PC). The method is based on a two-step process. An effective polarizability derived from Mie theory is determined by equating the extinction efficiency of an isolated nanoparticle (NP) to the extinction efficiency of an equivalent particle considering the dipolar limit. Then, this effective polarizability is used in the DDA framework to compute the optical response of an interacting particle array constituting the PC structure.
As a particular example, the method was applied to a linear array of core-shell magnetite@silica NPs to study the dependence of extinction and absorption on system parameters such as core radius, shell thickness, total radius, interparticle separation, and size distribution. The results indicate that an increase in these parameters leads to a redshift of the extinction peak as well as an increase in its $FWHM$. Finally, the method is applied to fitting experimental results on reflection/transmission measurements of magnetite@silica NPs colloids subjected to different magnetic field strengths with very good agreement.
The presented method reduces the computational cost and time for the NPs sizes considered, and can be applied to PCs responsive to different stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field and temperature, \textit{inter alia}.

Staging multiple laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs), each driven by its own laser pulse, is a promising technique for reaching higher particle energies than achievable in a single LPA. However, introducing subsequent laser pulses for post-acceleration in staged LPA geometries presents a significant challenge for conventional optics. Due to the focused, high-intensity nature of the laser beam interacting with the electron beam, the fluence on the coupling mirror surpasses the damage threshold of any solid-state optic. Replenishable plasma mirrors (PMs) offer a promising solution to this inherent restriction from high-energy pulses; however, they require a high stability and optical quality, and need to be produced at high repetition rates that match the needs to the staging experiment. Here, we investigate the properties of 4-octyl-4'-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) liquid crystal (LC) films, produced with our new "windmill" film formation device, for this application. We conduct this investigation by observing the reliability of film formation at high repetition rates, characterizing the reflected beam profile, and pointing stability as a function of temperature and film formation speed, including film flatness and surface quality, using low-power laser reflection measurements. Our measurements demonstrate that 8CB LC films exhibit unprecedented microscopic surface quality, crucial for preserving laser pulse properties upon reflection. We also show consistent film formation suitable for operation up to 0.5 Hz with great film to film angular stability. The results allow us to conclude that 8CB LC films hold significant potential as reliable and cost-effective PMs that are suitable for coupling LPA stages.

"Gold-Standard" $Δ$-Machine Learned and Transferable Potential for Linear Alkanes

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
The conformational properties of linear alkanes, C$_n$H$_{2n+2}$, have been of intense interest for many years. Experiments and corresponding electronic structure calculations were first reported in the mid-2000s and continue to the present time. These focus on the minimum chain length where the transition from the linear minimum to the hairpin minimum occurs. We recently reported a transferable many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (MB-PIP) for linear alkanes using B3LYP electronic energies, which do not account for dispersion. Here we report a $\Delta$-ML approach to elevate this B3LYP-based and new PBE0+MBD MB-PIP potentials using PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 energies. The new $\Delta$-corrected potentials predict the difference in these minima accurately, compared to benchmark CCSD(T) results, over the range C$_{12}$H$_{28}$ to C$_{28}$H$_{58}$. Vibrational power spectra are also reported for C$_{14}$H$_{30}$ and C$_{30}$H$_{62}$ using the uncorrected and $\Delta$-ML B3LYP. These new PIP-MB potentials for linear alkanes are the most accurate ones currently available and can be used in studies of properties of linear alkanes.

A scalable route to first-order response properties with correlated sampling phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)
To make useful connections with experimental measurements, correlated electronic structure theories must accurately predict chemical properties in addition to energies. We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach. Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to 18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In Navier-Stokes turbulence, a bottleneck effect in the energy cascade near the viscous cutoff causes an overshoot in the energy spectrum, or spectral bump, relative to Kolmogorov's -5/3 scaling. A similar overshoot occurs in large-eddy simulations (LES) when an eddy viscosity model is used. It is not a viscous phenomenon but is caused by error in the residual stress model. This artificial bottleneck effect in LES leads to an over-prediction of kinetic energy even when a dynamic procedure is used to capture the spectral decay at the cutoff scale. Recently, Johnson [2022, J. Fluid Mech., 934, A30] introduced a generalization of spatial filtering that provides a dynamic procedure without a test filter. In this paper, this method of Stokes flow regularization (SFR) is used with kinetic energy considerations to generate a range of LES models and explore the bottleneck effect in more detail. The coefficients for each dynamic model are determined locally, without averaging over homogeneous directions. A posteriori tests of the models in isotropic turbulence are reported, demonstrating the robustness of the SFR-based procedure for different model forms and enabling fair comparisons in terms of their impact on the bottleneck effect. An effective way to mitigate the bottleneck is to add a nonlinear gradient component in the residual stress closure, forming a dynamic mixed model. This approach improves representation of residual stress structure and energy cascade efficiencies.

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Coastal dune management often alters crest and lee geometry, yet quantifying the transport impact of small shape changes is difficult without heavy models. This paper presents a streamlined, field-anchored CFD workflow (AirSketcher) that ingests a side-profile image, auto-detects the dune outline, and computes near-surface flow. A neutral ABL power-law inlet is applied consistently across scenarios; turbulence is closed with a one-equation eddy-viscosity model. Model skill is established against multi-height mast measurements at Tomahawk Beach (Dunedin, NZ): height-matched profile correlations are strong and the solver reproduces stoss speed-up, crest amplification, and lee-side recovery. For design comparison, a geometry-aware transport proxy is formed as a cubic line-integral of speed along a near-surface polyline (Bagnold-type scaling). Three shapes are evaluated under the validated wind: baseline, top-cut, and back-cut. Integrated proxies indicate sand-transport reductions of 17% (top-cut) and 40% (back-cut) relative to the baseline. Flow patterns explain the reductions, crest-peak attenuation, muted lee jets, earlier reattachment, concentrating deposition nearer the crest, especially for the back-cut. The approach offers a rapid, interpretable metric for screening dune modifications before committing to fully coupled morpho dynamic modelling.

In recent work [Vavrek et al. (2025)], we developed the performance optimization framework spectre-ml for gamma spectrometers with variable performance across many readout channels. The framework uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and clustering to learn groups of similarly-performing channels and sweep through various learned channel combinations to optimize the performance tradeoff of including worse-performing channels for better total efficiency. In this work, we integrate the pyGEM uranium enrichment assay code with our spectre-ml framework, and show that the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a 30-minute measurement by an average of 20%, as tested on six different H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non-destructive assay measurement times in nuclear safeguards contexts. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the spectre-ml optimization framework can accommodate arbitrary end-user spectroscopic analysis code and performance metrics, enabling future optimizations for complex Pu spectra.

Comparison of turbulence statistics in isothermal and non-isothermal large eddy simulations of supercritical carbon dioxide jets

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Supercritical carbon dioxide is of interest in a wide range of engineering problems, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage as well as advanced cycles for power generation. Non-ideal variations in physical properties of supercritical carbon dioxide impact the physics of these systems. It is important to understand how drastic changes in thermodynamic properties influence these flow physics to aid and optimize the design of future technologies related to carbon capture and sequestration. In this study, we simulate turbulent supercritical carbon dioxide jets to gain a better understanding of these physics. Of particular interest is the impact of pseudo-boiling on supercritical flow dynamics. We use a second-order finite volume discretization method with adaptive mesh refinement as implemented in the reacting flow solver, PeleC, to perform a large eddy simulation of three turbulent jets of supercritical carbon dioxide. We use the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state to close the system and more accurately incorporate the departure from ideal gas behavior into the turbulent flow physics. We find that the isothermal supercritical jet exhibits many similar flow characteristics compared to ideal gas round turbulent jets, with minor differences seen in the decay and spreading rate of the jet and in a noticeable anisotropy between resolved turbulent kinetic energy components. The non-isothermal jet excluding the pseudo-boiling point exhibits only small difference compared to the isothermal case. Crossing the pseudo-boiling point results in markedly different behavior, with evidence indicative of increased Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instabilities and much faster jet decay and disintegration. These factors impact the degree of mixing in the transition region of the jet, indicating a potential for larger heat transfer and more rapid combustion dynamics.

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The EXL-50U spherical tokamak was built by Energy iNNovation to develop technologies for proton-boron fusion in spherical tokamaks (Liu et al., Phys. Plasmas 2024). We present a conceptual design of the Doppler backscattering (DBS) diagnostic for the EXL-50U spherical tokamak. DBS is a diagnostic capable of measuring plasma turbulence, which is especially important for transport in tokamaks. Starting from a set of physical design constraints, such as port window availability and in-vessel space, we used SCOTTY (Hall-Chen et al., PPCF 2022), an in-house beam tracing code, to predict the location of the cutoffs and the corresponding scattering wavenumbers for several EXL-50U plasma scenarios. We find that we are able to measure scattering locations of 0.15 $<$ $\rho$ $<$ 1, with corresponding turbulent wavenumbers of 2.47 cm$^{-1}$$<$ $k_{\perp}$ $<$ 9.49 cm$^{-1}$. Here, $\rho$ is the normalised radial coordinate of the scattering location, and $k_{\perp}$ is the corresponding turbulent wavenumber. We then determine the optimal toroidal launch angles to ensure that the probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the cutoff location, thereby maximising the backscattered signal. This matching is crucial due to the EXL-50U's high magnetic pitch angle, $\sim35^{\circ}$ at the outboard midplane. Given our results, we propose the use of toroidal steering and tunable frequency channels to ensure beams are well-matched with the magnetic pitch angle. We propose a quasioptical system that covers the U-band range (40--60 GHz).

We present and evaluate the Merrimack College Mobile Lightboard, which we built in 2017 and which is still in use in 2025. Our design was closely based on that of the groundbreaking 2014 Duke University Lightboard but with a smaller glass pane, 5 feet wide instead of 6 feet wide. The resulting scaled-down board is small enough to move in and out of individual faculty offices, but large enough to make detailed videos. An updated construction cost estimate is provided, and recent upgrades are briefly discussed. We believe that personalized office-based lightboarding represents an attractive option for many faculty members, with strengths that complement those of centralized installations. Our successful build suggests that this option is technically and financially feasible at many if not most higher education institutions.

Title:
Polarization Transmission in the Electron-Ion Collider's Hadron Storage Ring
Eiad Hamwi, Georg H. Hoffstaetter
Subjects:
Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
The successful operation of the future Electron-Ion Collider is contingent on maintaining high hadron beam polarization up to 275 GeV. The Hadron Storage Ring lattice, however, features a symmetry-breaking interaction region that excites strong, non-systematic spin resonances, posing a significant threat to polarization preservation. This paper systematically investigates two complementary strategies to ensure high polarization transmission. The first method involves optimizing the vertical betatron phase advance between Siberian snakes to orchestrate a cancellation of depolarizing kicks across the ring. We demonstrate through simulations that both dynamic and fixed-optics solutions based on this principle can successfully preserve polarization through the strongest resonances. The second, more powerful approach involves optimizing the snake rotation axes to suppress resonance driving terms at their source. We revisit established symmetric configurations, such as the Lee-Courant schemes, and introduce a novel, highly symmetric ``Doubly Lee-Courant" (DLC) scheme, which enforces a local \(\pi\) spin phase advance across every consecutive pair of snakes. Our analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with the DLC configuration providing an exceptionally robust and energy-insensitive baseline for polarization preservation. We conclude that a hybrid strategy, using a DLC snake scheme as a symmetric foundation and betatron phase tuning for fine corrections, offers the most effective path forward for the EIC and future high-energy polarized beam facilities.

Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.

Intermittent Viscoelastic Turbulence in Strongly Coupled Plasmas
Rauoof Wani, Sanat Tiwari
Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
Turbulence in strongly coupled plasmas (SCP) poses a unique challenge due to long-range interparticle interactions that impart viscoelastic properties to the medium. We report the first observation of intermittent viscoelastic turbulence in such plasmas using large-scale three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations. In driven dissipative SCP, we observe scale-dependent flow dynamics arising from the interplay between potential (elastic) and viscous dissipation at the particle level. Unlike conventional turbulence, governed by inertia and viscosity, SCP exhibits distinct energy transfer processes due to its intrinsic viscoelasticity. Both kinetic and elastic energy spectra show power-law scaling $E(k), \Phi(k) \propto k^{-3.5}$. In real space, velocity structure functions display nontrivial scaling, and the probability distribution functions of velocity increments deviate significantly from Gaussian behavior, especially in the tails, signatures of intermittency. These findings establish SCP as a novel platform for studying viscoelastic turbulence, with broad relevance to astrophysical plasmas, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.

Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos. We detail here engineering results from a Quantum Parity Detector (QPDs), one of a class of phonon sensitive qubits, and, as a first measurement, show that this device has a quiescent quasiparticle density of $1.8 \pm 0.8 \mu \mathrm{m}^{-3}$, in line with expectation. We also outline an argon ion-mill process for multi-step Josephson Junction fabrication, expanding the sparse literature on this topic, which proves useful in avoiding secondary parasitic junctions.

Ethylene glycol is a prebiotically relevant complex organic molecule detected in interstellar and cometary environments, yet quantitative low-energy electron-ethylene glycol scattering data remain limited for astrochemical modeling. This work presents an R-matrix study of low-energy electron collisions with ethylene glycol over the 0 to 12 eV energy range, using static exchange (SE), static exchange plus polarization (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models with 6-311G* and cc-pVTZ basis sets. We compute elastic, excitation, and differential cross sections within a close coupling framework. The dataset offers benchmark inputs for astrochemical models, supporting interpretation of ethylene glycol abundances in space and refining constraints on electron-induced prebiotic pathways.

Aminoacetonitrile occupies a prime importance in the interface between astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry. Its detection in the ISM establishes it as part of the organic inventory of star-forming regions, while its role as a glycine precursor highlights its significance for origins-of-life scenarios. In this work, electron scattering from aminoacetonitrile has been studied using the R-matrix method in the low-energy range from 0 to 10 eV. The calculations were carried out within the C_s point group using static-exchange (SE), static-exchange plus polarization (SEP), and configuration interaction (CI) models, with two basis sets (6-311G* and cc-pVTZ). Various scattering observables such as elastic, excitation, momentum transfer, and differential cross sections were examined. Since aminoacetonitrile is a prebiotically relevant molecule, these findings provide valuable insight into electron-driven processes in complex organic systems and form a theoretical foundation for future work on electron-induced reactivity in prebiotic and astrophysical environments.

Reconstruction of three-dimensional turbulent flows from sparse and noisy planar measurements: A weight-sharing neural network approach
Yaxin Mo, Luca Magri
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
This paper proposes a method for reconstructing three-dimensional turbulent flows from sparse measurements without the need for ground truth data during training. A weight-sharing network is developed to infer the full flow fields from measurements of velocity sampled at three planes and boundary pressure at one additional plane, inspired by experimental configurations. The weight-sharing network shares identical parameters along homogeneous directions, which results in efficient data utilization and reduced computational memory requirements. First, we compare the weight-sharing network to the PC-DualConvNet, adapted from prior work, by reconstructing a 3D Kolmogorov flow from noise-free measurements with a snapshot-enforced loss. Both networks accurately recover time-averaged 3D flow fields and the correct energy spectrum up to wavenumber 10. The weight-sharing network has the ability to infer flow structures distant from measurement planes. Second, we carry out reconstruction from measurements corrupted with white noise (SNR 15) using a mean-enforced loss. We show that, for the weight-sharing network, validation sensor loss on unseen data decreases with training sensor loss -- unlike PC-DualConvNet. This shows improved generalization and that training sensor loss estimates generalization error. The weight-sharing network offers good generalization, parameter efficiency, and hyperparameter robustness. The proposed method opens the possibility of three-dimensional flow reconstruction from experiments.

Satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms whose measurement instruments are tilted to the zenith line are subject to a spatial mismatch between the theoretical ground coordinates and the coordinate pair corresponding to the cloud layers sending spectral signals to the satellite. This is the case of the precipitation retrievals of the GPM Passive Microwave Imagery (GMI) on board the core satellite of the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) that uses the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF). Currently, no geometrical correction is applied to GMI retrievals of surface precipitation, creating a horizontal displacement (or parallax mismatching) between the reported surface and the corrected coordinates corresponding to the cloud structures intersecting the field of view.
GPROF precipitation retrievals over the Continental United States are analyzed using the ground-validated Multi-Resolution Multi-Sensor (GV-MRMS) system data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) temperature profiles. Results applying this parallax correction scheme show improvements in the overall retrieval accuracy of GPROF, mainly during the summer months, for every precipitation type, when the freezing level (FL) is relatively high. The development of this new parallax-correction algorithm for passive microwave radiometers will significantly improve the accuracy of remote sensing data by minimizing spatial distortions in atmospheric measurements, leading to more precise weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and environmental assessments.

Hydration water is vital for the stabilization of protein structure and function. The strong interaction of hydration water with the protein surface brings into question how dynamics and asymmetry of hydrogen bonds are perturbed for hydration water compared to bulk water. Here, z-scan transmission measurements at 0.5 Terahertz (THz) were performed for dilute and concentrated lysozyme solutions. A giant nonlinear absorption coefficient was found for dilute lysozyme solutions that is ten times greater than previous studies. This giant nonlinear response stems from the high average THz power generated by the TELBE free electron laser source, which drives the formation of a persistent thermal lens. In contrast, concentrated lysozyme solutions did not demonstrate a nonlinear response, revealing that crowding annihilates the thermal lensing effect. These results indicates that the THz nonlinear transmission of aqueous proteins solutions depends on the amount of hydration water present, and opens to the door to understanding the nonlinear optical properties of biologically relevant systems.

Real bipartite networks combine degree-constrained random mixing with structured, locality-like rules. We introduce a statistical filter that benchmarks node-level bipartite clustering against degree-preserving randomizations to classify nodes as geometric (signal) or random-like (noise). In synthetic mixtures with known ground truth, the filter achieves high F-scores and sharpens inference of latent geometric parameters. Applied to four empirical systems --metabolism, online group membership, plant-pollinator interactions, and languages-- it isolates recurrent neighborhoods while removing ubiquitous or weakly co-occurring entities. Filtering exposes a compact geometric backbone that disproportionately sustains connectivity under percolation and preserves downstream classifier accuracy in node-feature tasks, offering a simple, scalable way to disentangle structure from noise in bipartite networks.

Climate-Adaptive and Cascade-Constrained Machine Learning Prediction for Sea Surface Height under Greenhouse Warming

Subjects:
Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in climate and marine science. Given that greenhouse warming fundamentally reshapes ocean conditions such as stratification, circulation patterns and eddy activity, evaluating the climate adaptability of the ML model is crucial. While physical constraints have been shown to enhance the performance of ML models, kinetic energy (KE) cascade has not been used as a constraint despite its importance in regulating multi-scale ocean motions. Here we develop two sea surface height (SSH) prediction models (with and without KE cascade constraint) and quantify their climate adaptability at the Kuroshio Extension. Our results demonstrate that both models exhibit only slight performance degradation under greenhouse warming conditions. Incorporating the KE cascade as a physical constraint significantly improve the model performance, reducing eddy kinetic energy errors by 14.7% in the present climate and 15.9% under greenhouse warming. This work presents the first application of the kinetic energy (KE) cascade as a physical constraint for ML based ocean state prediction and demonstrates its robust adaptability across climates, offering guidance for the further development of global ML models for both present and future conditions.

Extreme events such as earthquakes, floods, and power blackouts often display burst phenomena where multiple extreme events occur in quick succession or in bunches. This study examines bunching of extreme events on a complex network using a random walk transport model. We find that in a modular network, a small cluster sparsely connected with the rest, shows bunching and correlations among extreme events. The bunching and correlations emerge naturally in our system. We use several characterization techniques, namely the recurrence time distribution, autocorrelation function, bursty trains, burstiness parameter and memory coefficient to quantify the bunching and correlations of extreme events. Our study shows that the network structure plays a significant role in the bunching of extreme events.

Superfluorescence, a cooperative emission phenomenon arising from the coherent coupling of excited dipoles, has historically been observed under optical excitation in carefully engineered quantum systems. Here, we report the first observation of superfluorescence triggered by ionizing radiation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystal (NC) superlattices. Using CsPbBr3 NC superlattices with long-range structural and electronic order, we demonstrate that secondary electrons generated by high-energy photons can induce efficient cooperative emission bursts characteristic of superfluorescence with unprecedented scintillation lifetime of ~40 ps, thereby introducing a new class of coherent scintillating metamaterials. Side-by-side optical and scintillation measurements reveal a direct analogy between ionizing and intense optical excitation, both leading to high excitonic densities that result in superfluorescent emission, even at mild, technologically accessible cryogenic temperatures. The discovery that incoherent, stochastic ionization cascades can seed coherent many-body optical responses with radiatively accelerated luminescence and large Stokes shifts establishes a pathway toward ultrafast, reabsorption-free, quantum-ordered nanotechnological scintillators, paving the way for the future development of radiation detectors based on quantum technologies for advanced radiation detection applications.

Emergence of power laws in hierarchical dynamics on multi-level graphs

Power-law distributions are widely recognized in complex systems physics as indicative of underlying complexity in interaction networks and critical macroscopic behavior. Previous studies, notably those of Newman and others, have emphasized the importance of network structure and dynamics in understanding the emergence of such statistical patterns and predicting extreme events. In this study, we investigate the emergence of power-law behavior in delay distributions within a multi-level hierarchical network of agents governed by simple priority rules. Using railway systems as a case study, we model the dynamics of high-speed and local trains agents assigned distinct priority levels-operating within a simplified hierarchical network framework. By introducing Laplacian-distributed stochastic fluctuations into scheduled travel times, derived from empirical data, we observe that local trains exhibit a markedly higher incidence of higher delays than high-speed trains. To account for this phenomenon, we propose a queue-based dynamical model, calibrated using Italian railway data, and validate our findings through comparative analysis with both Italian and German datasets. The model accurately reproduces the empirically observed power-law exponent associated with the Italian local train delays. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of operational policies, such as priority assignment and delay compensation thresholds, revealing distinct cut-offs in delay distributions at 30 and 60 minutes for high-speed and local trains, respectively-corresponding to refund eligibility criteria in Italy. Such cut-offs are absent in the German case, where no comparable priority-change policies are in effect. These results underscore the capacity of simple hierarchical structures and rule-based dynamics to generate complex statistical behaviors without necessitating intricate interaction networks.

Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile. This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images. Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.

Runaway electron termination on plasma facing components can trigger material explosions that are accompanied by the expulsion of fast solid debris. Due to the large kinetic energies of the ejected dust particles, their subsequent mechanical impacts on the vessel lead to extensive cratering. Earlier experimental studies of high velocity micrometric tungsten dust collisions with tungsten plates focused exclusively on normal impacts. Here, oblique high velocity tungsten-on-tungsten mechanical impacts are reproduced in a controlled manner by a two-stage light gas gun shooting system. The strong dependence of the crater characteristics and crater morphology on the incident angle is documented. A reliable empirical damage law is extracted for the dependence of the crater depth on the incident angle.

Limited radiation hardness is the primary drawback to implementing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) in high-luminosity environments, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. Hadron irradiation generates defects in the silicon lattice of SiPMs, increasing dark current, dark count rate (DCR), crosstalk, and afterpulsing, while degrading gain and photon resolution. The expected radiation dose in the photon camera of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the CBM experiment ranges from $8\times 10^9$ to $5\times 10^{10}$ n$_{\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$ after two-months of operation at maximum beam energy and intensity. In this work, we evaluated the radiation hardness of three different SiPMs: AFBR-S4N66P024M, S14160-6050HS, and MICROFC-60035. The samples were exposed to neutron irradiation with doses ranging from $3\times 10^8$ to $1\times 10^{11}$ n$_{\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$. The neutron radiation damage was found to increase the SiPM dark current up to $10^3$ times, DCR up to $10^2$ times, and afterpulsing up to $10\%$ while decreasing their gain and photon resolution. We performed electrical annealing (250 $^{\circ}$C/30 min) on the samples to recover the photon resolution and decrease the DCR and dark current.

The hydrogen (H2) fueled direct-injection (DI) compression-ignition (CI) argon power cycle (APC) is an attractive technology to counteract the mismatch between energy demand and supply from renewable energy sources. The development of the APC, as well as air-breathing DI CI H2 engines, can be advanced by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) combustion models are an effective approach to predict global in-cylinder variables such pressure and heat release rate. However, validity of this method to simulate the complex phenomena associated with high-pressure, auto-igniting hydrogen jets is not ensured due to the underlying model assumptions. In this study, a RANS CFD environment using two commonly used eddy-viscosity models and the Reynolds stress model (RSM) is extensively validated. Combustion is modeled with a detailed chemistry model. First, hydrogen distributions in non-reacting jets are compared against literature data to assess the accuracy of the models on turbulent mixing at high pressure. Subsequently, the capability of the model to simulate auto-igniting jets is assessed by comparison with reported measurement data of closed-vessel experiments at high pressure. Ignition delay times, pressure rise profiles, and heat release rate profiles are compared for different ambient temperature and oxygen concentration. Adequate agreement is found for the diffusive combustion phase for all models, despite the lack of turbulence-chemistry interaction in the combustion model. Trends with ambient temperature and oxygen concentration were well predicted and the best agreement is found for the RSM.

Fundamental particle physics is a key part of an undergraduate physics curriculum, but can be challenging to incorporate into teaching laboratories. We present an undergraduate laboratory experiment that enables students to work with real data from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber to search for the existence of a sterile neutrino: a new, fourth, neutrino state. This search has galvanized physicists for decades, as the existence of sterile neutrinos could play a critical role in understanding fundamental processes in the early universe, provide viable dark matter candidates, and offer a natural explanation for the origin of neutrino masses. From an experimental point of view, anomalies observed in several neutrino experiments provide tantalizing hints of their existence. The analysis presented here, whilst based on real data, has been adapted as a pedagogical tool for an undergraduate teaching laboratory, in which students are asked to develop an understanding of neutrino oscillation theory, analyse a MicroBooNE data sample, and apply statistical methods to search for a potential sterile neutrino. The analysis incorporates machine learning techniques to improve event classification. Students are encouraged to explore these and other methods to optimize their results.

Optomagnonic dielectric resonators offer a promising platform for the bidirectional conversion of microwave and optical photons at the single quantum level. Current implementation of such a conversion lacks from low magneto-optical interaction strength, limiting its practical utilization in quantum technologies. The main bottleneck is the small spatial overlap between optical and magnon modes. Here, we show that utilization of a disk and ring geometries notably increases the mode overlap. We analyze the interaction volume of optical whispering gallery and magnon Kittel modes inside yttrium iron garnet disk and ring microcavities of various sizes and found a significant improvement in modes coupling up to $\sim4.5~kHz$ . Maximal theoretical conversion efficiency for small disks with radius $5~\mu m$ can reach unity for optimal optical power $\sim100~\mu W$, which is experimentally feasible. Strategies for further improvements of interactions are discussed.

We investigated the molecular dynamics of the prototypical deep eutectic solvent (DES) ethaline. We disentangled the different motions of its two constituents, namely choline chloride and ethylene glycol on a spatio-temporal range that extends from sub-nanometer to micrometer distances and from picosecond to millisecond times. This was achieved by a combination of pulsed-field-gradient NMR, time-of-flight, and backscattering quasielastic neutron scattering experiments with isotopically labelled samples. On the micrometer scale, we observe that the translational motions of the two DES constituents obey classical hydrodynamics, with distinct diffusivities that reflect their different hydrodynamic radii. This is no longer valid at the nanometer-scale, where the two DES components present similar short-ranged diffusivities, which indicates a significant effect of their supramolecular association. The sub-nanometer scale motions include jumps that precede Fickian diffusion, and localized dynamics that precede the breaking of the transient cage formed by neighboring molecules. Therein, the spatial amplitude of the localized motions mirrors their different molecular sizes, while their respective correlation times contrast with observations made for other choline-based DES such as glyceline. This result underlines the importance of more subtle effects, such as the different H-bond propensities of the polyol donor, and demonstrate the difficulty to anticipate the nanoscale dynamic behavior of DES from the knowledge of their macroscopic properties.

This study reveals how residual oil affects dissolution patterns and effective reaction rates during CO2-acidified brine injection into Ketton limestone under reservoir conditions. We combine time-resolved X-ray microtomography (micro-CT), core-flooding experiments, and direct numerical simulations to assess the impact of pore space heterogeneity, oil distribution and injection rate. We find that the coupling between pore structure, residual oil saturation and oil displacement control flow heterogeneity, reactive surface accessibility, dissolution patterns and the reaction rates. At low injection rate, dissolution by channel widening is enhanced by oil displacement. This mechanism is especially important when dissolution is suppressed by heterogeneity in the pore space and the residual oil. At high injection rates, a more uniform dissolution occurs and can be enhanced by re-mobilisation of oil blocking brine flow. Effective reaction rates in two-phase flow are found to be lower than in the the equivalent single-phase case and up to two orders of magnitude lower than the batch rates due to persistent transport limitations. These findings offer mechanistic insights into multiphase reactive transport in carbonates and highlight the need for accurate understanding of the impact of the hydrocarbon phase on reaction to improve predictions of CO2 storage efficiency.

Title:
Data-driven transient growth analysis
Yin Wang, Xuerui Mao
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Transient growth analysis has been extensively studied in asymptotically stable flows to identify their short-term amplification of perturbations. Generally, in global transient growth analyses, matrix-free methods are adopted, requiring the construction of adjoint equations, either in the discrete or continuous form. This paper introduces a data-driven algorithm that circumvents the adjoint equations by extracting the optimal initial perturbation and its energy growth over a specified time horizon from transient snapshots of perturbations. This method is validated using data from the linearised complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, backward-facing step flow, and the Batchelor vortex. Unlike model-based methods, which require $S$ sets of integrations of the linearised governing equation and its adjoint for $S$ time horizons, the proposed approach collects the snapshots of $S$ time horizons in one integration of the linearised equation. Furthermore, this study provides a robust framework for utilising proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes to synthesise optimal modes. The developed capacity to conduct transient growth analyses without solving the adjoint equations is expected to significantly reduce the barriers to transient dynamics research.

Numerical study of friction reduction and underlying mechanism of air film via parallel and tandem injections on a hypersonic flat plate at high altitude

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
This study uses numerical simulations to analyze a flat-plate with air films generated via parallel and tandem injections under freestream conditions of Ma=15 at an altitude of H=60km. Simulations are carried out using various mass flow rates and jet spacing, followed by an examination of the effect of the streamwise-to-spanwise aspect ratio of the injection hole. The following key findings are acquired: (1) Under hypersonic and high-altitude conditions, the air injection lifts the incoming flow, producing a pronounced low-speed region near the injection site and over the downstream wall. A plateau appears in the wall-normal distribution of the streamwise velocity, with a value significantly lower than that of its freestream counterpart. This reduces the near-wall velocity gradient, thereby achieving drag reduction. However, the subsequent flow reattachment may lead to localized drag increases; (2) As the mass flow rate of injection increases, the wall-normal extent of the near-wall low-speed layer expands and the film coverage broadens; however, the increased friction limits gains in drag reduction, and greater flow losses are also incurred; (3) Increasing the hole spacing in the parallel injection reduces the penetration height of the film, the spanwise coverage, and the drag reduction efficiency, as well as decreasing the flow losses. In contrast, for the studied tandem injections, no significant differences are observed with analogous spacing variations; (4) Increasing the injection aspect ratio enlarges the spanwise coverage of the low-speed layer, improves the spanwise uniformity of the streamwise velocity distribution, diminishes the friction-increasing zones, and significantly enhances the drag reduction. Notably, the consequences are the inverse of those of the low-speed situation.

Background: Mechanical ventilation is life-saving for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome but can also contribute to lung injury and long-term morbidity. Protective ventilation strategies are recommended, yet implementation in neonatal intensive care units remains inconsistent, and infants continue to be exposed to injurious ventilator settings. Objective: To develop and validate a cohort of neonatal digital twins, based on mechanistic models of cardiopulmonary physiology calibrated to individual patient data, as a tool for simulating and optimising protective ventilation strategies. Methods: A high-fidelity computational simulator of human cardiopulmonary physiology was adapted to neonatal-specific parameters, including lung compliance, dead space, pulmonary vascular resistance, oxygen consumption, and fetal haemoglobin oxygen affinity. Digital twins were generated using data at 65 time points from 11 preterm neonates receiving volume-controlled ventilation. Model parameters were calibrated to minimise the error between simulated and observed PaO2, PaCO2, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). Results: Digital twins reproduced measured data with mean absolute percentage errors of 3.9% (PaO2), 3.0% (PaCO2), and 5.8% (PIP) across the cohort. Predictions for uncalibrated variables (pHa, SaO2, mean and minimum airway pressure) also showed high accuracy, with errors <5%. Strong correlations and narrow limits of agreement were observed across all patients and time points. Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of creating fully mechanistic digital twins of mechanically ventilated neonates with RDS. The twins accurately captured patient-specific gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, supporting their potential as a platform for conducting virtual clinical trials and for the design of individualized, lung-protective ventilation strategies.

Causal Finite-Tick Dynamics as a Resolution of the Classical Radiation Reaction Problem
Hadi Z.Olyaei
Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)
The radiation-reaction problem in classical electrodynamics has long resisted a consistent solution: the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation admits runaways and pre-acceleration, while the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation avoids these pathologies only as a reduction-of-order approximation. We introduce Tick-Tock (TT) dynamics, a causal finite-step formulation in which radiation recoil arises from discrete tick-by-tick updates. In the continuum limit, TT reproduces the LL equation, ensuring consistency with all experimental tests of radiation reaction. Unlike LL, however, TT does not rely on reduction of order: the recoil force is expressed directly through finite-difference changes of the Lorentz acceleration, making the Schott-like energy term explicit as a telescoping boundary contribution. This construction eliminates pre-acceleration and runaway solutions while providing a transparent stepwise energy balance. Moreover, the finite-tick structure introduces a natural high-frequency cutoff, suppressing unphysical growth in discontinuous fields. Taken together, TT offers a stable and causal reformulation of radiation reaction, consistent with LL in smooth regimes but extending its applicability to rapidly varying ones, and it suggests that characteristic timescales such as $\tau_{0}$ may play a special role.

Calculating the laser-induced transition probability by using the fluence distribution that neglects interference effects (e.g., by employing ray-tracing methods) can lead to an overestimation of this probability, as it underestimates saturation effects. In this paper, we investigate how interference effects in the multi-pass cell, used to enhance the laser fluence, affect the laser-induced transition probability between hyperfine levels in muonic hydrogen, a bound system of a negative muon and a proton. To avoid complications related to the exact knowledge of the intra-cavity field, we develop a simple model that estimates the maximal possible interference effects for given laser and multi-pass cell parameters, thereby providing an upper bound for the resulting decrease in transition probability relative to the case where these effects are neglected. A numerical evaluation of this upper bound for muonic hydrogen shows that, under our experimental conditions, such effects can be safely neglected. Nonetheless, the methodology presented here could be applied to estimate the impact of interference effects on the laser-induced transition probability in other experiments involving coherent light in multi-pass systems.

The CEPC clock issue is related with the RF frequency coordination between the various accelerator systems and may affect the operation modes of both the accelerator and the detector. The timing structure of CEPC has been restudied with the collaboration of the accelerator team and the detector team. After discussions between two sides, the CEPC bunch structure is set such that the spacings between adjacent bunches in any CEPC operation mode are integer numbers of 23.08 ns. The master CEPC clock will be provided by the accelerator to the detector systems with a frequency of 43.33 MHz, synchronous to the beam. The CEPC detector system relies on the clock to sample physics signal at the right time. It was found that if the circumference of CEPC is slightly changed to 99955.418 m, not only is the orbit length closer to 100 km, but also the detector would benefit more for the first 10-year operation.

The model minority myth obscures the educational disparities among Asian student groups in physics education. This study estimated the variation in conceptual physics knowledge across 19 Asian racial/ethnic groups at the start and end of introductory physics courses. Utilizing data from the LASSO platform, we analyzed responses from 16,810 students enrolled in 493 introductory calculus-based physics courses across 64 U.S. institutions. We applied Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) to analyze the student outcomes with the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. We found that the predicted posttest score of the lowest performing group is the same as the predicted pretest score of the highest performing group. Disaggregated data reveal performance differences among Asian groups that aggregated reporting conceals. To avoid the challenges that can arise when disaggregating data, instructors and researchers must consider many factors, such as research questions and/or methodological constraints. By leveraging the expanded identity options within the LASSO platform and the MAIHDA model, our approach offers a powerful framework for exposing hidden disparities and advancing equity in STEM education.

In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and strength properties of the material, respectively.

Impact of Static Disorder and Dephasing on Quantum Transport in LH1-RC Models

We numerically study excitation transfer in an artificial LH1--RC complex -- an $N$-site donor ring coupled to a central acceptor -- driven by a narrowband optical mode and evolved under a Lindblad master equation with loss and dephasing. In the absence of disorder, the light-driven system exhibits a tall, narrow on-resonance efficiency peak (near unity for our parameters); dephasing lowers and narrows this peak without shifting its position. Off resonance, the efficiency shows environmentally assisted transport with a clear non-monotonic dependence on dephasing and a finite optimum. Under static disorder, two regimes emerge: photon--ring coupling and diagonal energetic disorder mix the drive into dark ring modes, activate dissipative channels, and depress efficiency over a detuning window, whereas intra-ring coupling disorder has a much smaller impact in the tested range; increasing the intra-ring coupling $g$ moves dark-mode crossings away from the operating detuning and restores near-peak performance. In the ordered, symmetric, single-excitation, narrowband limit we \emph{analytically derive} closed-form transfer efficiencies by projecting onto the $k{=}0$ bright mode and solving the photon--bright mode--acceptor trimer via a Laplace/linear-algebra (determinant) formula; these expressions include a probability-conservation identity $\eta + \sum_k L_k = 1$ that benchmarks the simulations and quantitatively predicts the resonant line shape and its dephasing-induced narrowing. A minimal ring toy model further reproduces coherent trapping and its relief by moderate dephasing (ENAQT). These analytics are exact in the ordered limit and serve as mechanistic guides outside this limit, yielding practical design rules for robust, bio-inspired light-harvesting devices.

The development of safe, efficient, and reversible hydrogen storage materials is critical for advancing hydrogen-based energy technologies and achieving carbon-neutral goals. Ennea-Graphene, a new 2D carbon allotrope made of 4-, 5-, 6-, and mainly 9-membered carbon rings (nonagons), is introduced via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that the monolayer is mechanically and dynamically stable at 300 K, as no imaginary modes are detected. The pristine system further exhibits metallic-like electronic behavior. The material exhibits high in-plane stiffness (Young modulus of 255 N/m). Sodium adsorption at the centers of the nonagonal rings is energetically favorable, with a binding energy of approximately -1.56 eV, leading to the formation of the Na@Ennea-Graphene complex. The calculated H2 adsorption energies range from -0.15 eV to -0.18 eV. The Na-decorated structure demonstrates excellent hydrogen storage performance, reversibly adsorbing up to four H2 molecules per Na atom (8.8 wt\% H2). This capacity surpasses the U.S. Department of Energy's 2025 target for onboard hydrogen storage materials. The adsorbed H2 remains molecular (H-H bond of 0.76~Å) and can be released under near-ambient conditions, as verified by 300 K ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings position sodium-decorated Ennea-Graphene as a promising nanomaterial for next-generation hydrogen storage technologies.

We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++ Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic. These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.

Seniority-zero Linear Canonical Transformation Theory

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
We propose a method to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation for strongly correlated systems by applying a unitary transformation to reduce the complexity of the physical Hamiltonian. In particular, we seek a transformation that maps the Hamiltonian into the seniority-zero space, since such Hamiltonians are computationally more tractable while still capturing strong correlation within electron pairs. The unitary rotation is evaluated using the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, truncated to two-body operators via the operator-decomposition strategy of canonical transformation (CT) theory, which rewrites higher-rank terms approximately in terms of one- and two-body operators. The method was tested on three molecular systems: H$_6$ in the STO-6G basis, BeH$_2$ along the standard C$_{2v}$ insertion pathway, and BH in the 6-31G basis. In all cases, the Seniority-zero Linear Canonical Transformation (SZ-LCT) method delivers highly accurate results, with most errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ Hartree. Additionally, SZ-LCT has a cost of $O(N^7/n_c)$, where $n_c$ is the number of CPU cores, making it comparable to single-reference methods when the number of available cores is at least equal to the number of orbitals.

Attosecond Light Skyrmion Pulses via High Harmonic Generation
David Marco, Luis Plaja, Carlos Hernández-García
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Paraxial light skyrmions are topological configurations that map a spatial domain of the field onto the full Poincaré sphere of polarization states. While skyrmions have been explored in continuous-wave regimes, their realization in the ultrafast domain remains open. Here we demonstrate that attosecond skyrmion pulses can be generated via high-harmonic generation. Advanced simulations combining single-atom strong-field theory and macroscopic propagation reveal that an infrared linearly polarized vector beam with fractional orbital angular momentum produces extreme-ultraviolet harmonic fields with nearly identical skyrmion polarization distributions across a broad spectral range. Using 1.2 $\mu$m driving fields and experimentally realistic spectral filtering, the coherent superposition of consecutive harmonics centered at 70 eV yields $\sim500$ attosecond pulse trains. Our results opens opportunities to use structured attosecond light with topological polarization textures,in fields as ultrafast control, imaging and spectroscopy.

Optics (physics.optics)
We present a novel passive resonant fiber-optic gyroscope (RFOG) design that achieves two true quadrature points at $\pi/2 $ and $3\pi/2$, enabling angular rotation measurement with maximum sensitivity. The use of a broadband light source, as demonstrated in previous studies, eliminates the need for precise frequency locking, while the resonant enhancement allows high sensitivity with significantly shorter fiber lengths. Building on this approach, the present work integrates a Non-Reciprocal Polarization Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS) into the broadband RFOG configuration, called NRPPS-RFOG, enabling truly passive operation without the need for active modulation-demodulation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the coupling ratio and NRPPS phase shift critically influence both sensitivity and linearity. An additional NRPPS section extends the measurable angular rotation range, addressing limitations arising from long fiber loops. The proposed design combines compactness, high performance, and low complexity, offering a practical path toward navigation grade RFOGs. These results highlight the potential of passive NRPPS-RFOGs for cost-effective, high-precision rotational sensing in demanding applications.

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering applications, given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these approaches, such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting low-fidelity models by leveraging available observations of the problem. However, the solely data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally requires dense observations that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study, we propose a physical loss term addition to the field inversion stage of the FIML technique similar to the physics-informed machine learning applications. This addition embeds the complex physics of the problem into the low-fidelity model, which allows for obtaining dense gradient information for every correction parameter and acts as an adaptive regularization term improving inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed Field Inversion approach is tested using three different examples and highlights that incorporating physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for limited data cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally, this modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an acceptable level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.

A flux bounce-back scheme for the filtered Spectral Element Lattice Boltzmann Method

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We develop a spectral element lattice Boltzmann method (SELBM) with the flux bounce-back (FBB) scheme, to enable accurate simulations of single-phase fluid dynamics in unstructured mesh. We adopt an Eulerian description of the streaming process in place of the perfect shift in the regular LBM. The spectral element method is used to spatially discretize the convective term, while the strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method is used for time integration. To increase stability, we investigate the use of an explicit filter, particularly in the context of the sensitive double shear layer problem. The results indicate that by using the high-order polynomial, we can effectively eliminate the small vortices around the neck region. We introduce the flux bounce-back scheme to enable the current scheme to handle complex boundaries. The proposed scheme and flux boundary method are validated through benchmark simulations, including the unsteady Couette flow and the planar Poiseuille flow. Further validation is provided through the Taylor-Green vortex problem, demonstrating the accuracy and convergence of the scheme for isotropic turbulence. Finally, we consider a fully developed turbulent flow within a cylindrical pipe and correctly predict the turbulent boundary layer profile.

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)
Neural-network-based machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for predicting atomic energies and forces, enabling accurate and efficient simulations in atomistic modeling. A key limitation of traditional deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science, where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815 TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.

On the Overestimation of Efficiency in Relativistic Electron Scattering

Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
Recent reviews in ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) have claimed that relativistic electrons exhibit enhanced elastic scattering efficiency, frequently quantified as a \gamma^2 increase in the differential cross section. These claims, however, originate from angular-domain analyses that overlook the compression of scattering angles \theta with increasing electron energy, leading to an apparent, but artificial, enhancement. In this work, we recast the problem in momentum-transfer space q, where scattering is accurately accounted for. This transformation eliminates the angular compression artefact and reveals that high-energy scaling follows a simple \beta^{-2} dependence, with no intrinsic relativistic gain. We demonstrate this by directly integrating relativistic differential elastic-scattering cross sections from ELSEPA and by applying a straightforward transformation of the well-known Mott-Massey formalism into q-space. The results are general, with calculations performed for elements from carbon to gold and for energies between 50 keV and 5000 keV. They reproduce the long-established trend in total elastic scattering cross sections, in which scattering strength decreases with increasing electron kinetic energy. Practically, at energies above roughly 50 keV, scattering is already dominated by the forward direction, and most of the scattered intensity falls within the acceptance range of typical UED detectors. These findings correct a widespread misconception in the UED literature and provide a more accurate and intuitive framework for interpreting and optimizing high-energy electron scattering experiments.

Motivated by applications to underwater explosions and volcanic eruptions, this paper considers the evolution of an initial pressure disturbance in the ocean, including effects due to the dynamic and static compression of water and the free surface. In order to solve the equations of motion of a linear compressible ocean, a special inner product is introduced, which allows us to apply self-adjoint operator theory. What results is a Hilbert space in which the acoustic-gravity modes are orthogonal in the generalised sense. This allows the time-domain evolution of the free surface and subsurface pressure field resulting from an initial disturbance to be calculated. Our simulations show initial radial propagation of the pressure pulse and subsequent reflection from the water surface and the rigid ocean floor, eventually leading to horizontal propagation away from the source point. The solutions with and without the inclusion of the static compression are compared, and the effect of static compression is shown to be small but not negligible.

The present work develops a rigorous framework for collective dipole oscillations in dense dielectric media by extending the Lorentz oscillator model to include both quadratic (second order) and cubic (third order) nonlinear restoring forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are incorporated via the dyadic Greens function, leading to a nonlocal description of the medium. Starting from the generalised oscillator equation, the system is expressed in matrix form with an effective stiffness matrix. Using a harmonic steady state ansatz, nonlinear terms are approximated in the frequency domain. Diagonalisation provides collective normal modes, which serve as a basis for perturbative expansion zeroth order captures the linear response, while higher orders describe nonlinear corrections. The polarisation is expressed through corrected mode amplitudes, yielding an effective nonlinear nonlocal susceptibility kernel. Finally, the scalar Greens function formalism is applied to derive the structured output field. These approaches bridge microscopic dipole dynamics with macroscopic optical propagation, offering key insights into nonlinear light matter interaction and turbulence influenced field evolution.

Title:
Short-Range Solvent-Solvent and Ion-Solvent Correlations at Metal-Electrolyte Interfaces: Parameterization and Benchmarking
Mengke Zhang, Jun Huang
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Short-range correlations in electrolyte solutions lead to oscillatory profiles of water polarization and ionic concentration at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The recently developed density-potential-polarization functional theory (DPPFT) provides a comprehensive framework to incorporate these short-range correlation effects. In the present work, the parameters describing short-range solvent-solvent and ion-solvent correlations in DPPFT are determined from the wavenumber-dependent dielectric susceptibility spectrum of pure water and from ion solvation energies derived within nonlocal electrostatics, respectively. The experimental ionic-radius-dependent hydration energies of alkali metal cations and halide anions are well reproduced by the solvation model. The charge hydration asymmetry is explained as the stronger short-range repulsion between cations and water molecules compared to that between anions and water molecules. Using these parameters, DPPFT is then applied to investigate short-range correlation effects at the Ag(111)-NaF aqueous electrolyte interface. The water polarization profiles obtained from DPPFT calculations show good agreement with AIMD simulations. Furthermore, as the strength of short-range ion-solvent repulsion increases, the peaks of anionic/layers shift from regions near centers of positive/negative polarization charges toward those of opposite sign, thereby preserving solvation configurations similar to those in bulk solution. This work establishes a consistent procedure for parameterizing short-range correlation effects within the DPPFT framework, thereby enabling a more quantitative and computationally efficient description of atomic-scale phenomena at electrochemical interfaces.

Tropical storms cause extensive property damage and loss of life, making them one of the most destructive types of natural hazards. The development of predictive models that identify interventions effective at mitigating storm impacts has considerable potential to reduce these adverse outcomes. In this study, we use an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach for optimizing intervention schemes that improve resilience to coastal flooding. We combine three different AI models to optimize the selection of intervention types, sites, and scales in order to minimize the expected cost of flooding damage in a given region, including the cost of installing and maintaining interventions. Our approach combines data-driven generation of storm surge fields, surrogate modeling of intervention impacts, and the solving of a continuous-armed bandit problem. We applied this methodology to optimize the selection of sea wall and oyster reef interventions near Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida, an area that was catastrophically impacted by Hurricane Michael. Our analysis predicts that intervention optimization could be used to potentially save billions of dollars in storm damage, far outpacing greedy or non-optimal solutions.

A Low-cost Quasi-planar Array Probe for Photoacoustic Imaging

Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a novel hybrid imaging technique that combines the benefits of both optical and acoustic imaging modalities, which provides functional and molecular optical contrasts of deep tissue. Commonly used ultrasound transducers for PAI include linear and planar arrays, which can provide two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction, respectively. However, linear arrays cannot provide reconstruction of 3D images, which makes it impossible to locate chromophores in 3D space. Although planar array can provide fast 3D imaging in real time, it usually requires thousands of analog-to-digital conversion channels for data acquisition, which is costly. To fill the gap between 2D and 3D PAI, we propose a quasi-planar array that uses double 16-elements-linear arrays arranged in parallel to achieve real-time 3D imaging. We first conducted simulation studies to prove that the quasi-planar probe can perform 3D imaging to localize simple chromophores. Then, the agarose phantom experiment demonstrated that the probe can reconstruct 3D imaging of multiple absorbers in different depths. A potential application of this device is to provide a low-cost 3D PAI solution for fast tracking of needle tip during needle biopsy, which will be further explored in our future work.

Accurate proton dose calculation using Monte Carlo (MC) is computationally demanding in workflows like robust optimisation, adaptive replanning, and probabilistic inference, which require repeated evaluations. To address this, we develop a neural surrogate that integrates Monte Carlo dropout to provide fast, differentiable dose predictions along with voxelwise predictive uncertainty. The method is validated through a series of experiments, starting with a one-dimensional analytic benchmark that establishes accuracy, convergence, and variance decomposition. Two-dimensional bone-water phantoms, generated using TOPAS Geant4, demonstrate the method's behavior under domain heterogeneity and beam uncertainty, while a three-dimensional water phantom confirms scalability for volumetric dose prediction. Across these settings, we separate epistemic (model) from parametric (input) contributions, showing that epistemic variance increases under distribution shift, while parametric variance dominates at material boundaries. The approach achieves significant speedups over MC while retaining uncertainty information, making it suitable for integration into robust planning, adaptive workflows, and uncertainty-aware optimisation in proton therapy.

We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-André model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.

A Graph-Neural-Network-Entropy model of vital node identification on network attack and propagation
Huaizhi Liao, Tian Qiu, Guang Chen
Subjects:

Vital nodes usually play a key role in complex networks. Uncovering these nodes is an important task in protecting the network, especially when the network suffers intentional attack. Many existing methods have not fully integrated the node feature, interaction and state. In this article, we propose a novel method (GNNE) based on graph neural networks and information entropy. The method employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn the nodes' features, which are input into a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to obtain the influence factor of nodes, and the node influence factors are used to calculate the nodes' entropy to evaluate the node importance. The GNNE takes advantage of the GCN and GAT, with the GCN well extracting the nodes' features and the GAT aggregating the features of the nodes' neighbors by using the attention mechanism to assign different weights to the neighbors with different importance, and the nodes' entropy quantifies the nodes' state in the network. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic Barabasi-Albert network, and tested on six real datasets. Compared with eight traditional topology-based methods and four graph-machine-learning-based methods, the GNNE shows an advantage for the vital node identification in the perspectives of network attack and propagation.

Efficient Particle Acceleration in 2.5-Dimensional, Hybrid-Kinetic Simulations of Decaying, Supersonic, Plasma Turbulence

Collisionless, turbulent plasmas surround the Earth, from the magnetosphere to the intergalactic medium, and the fluctuations within them affect nearly every field in the space sciences, from space weather forecasts to theories of galaxy formation. Where turbulent motions become supersonic, their interactions can lead to the formation of shocks, which are known to efficiently energize ions to cosmic-ray energies. We present 2.5-dimensional, hybrid-kinetic simulations of decaying, supersonic, non-relativistic turbulence in a collisionless plasma using the code dHybridR. Turbulence within these simulations is highly compressible; after accounting for this compression by taking the omni-directional power-spectrum of the density weighted velocity field, we find turbulent spectra with power-law slopes of $\alpha \approx -\frac{5}{3}$ for low Mach numbers, in the inertial range, and $\alpha \approx -2$ for high Mach numbers. Ions embedded in the highly supersonic simulations are accelerated to non-thermal energies at efficiencies similar to those seen in shocks, despite being in a non-relativistic regime and lacking the large scale structure of a shock. We observe that particles are accelerated into a power-law spectrum, with a slope of $q \approx 2.5$ in (non-relativistic) energy. We compare these results to those obtained from the theory and simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and discuss the astrophysical implications of this theoretical work.

Graph entropy, degree assortativity, and hierarchical structures in networks
Fatihcan M. Atay, Türker Bıyıkoğlu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
We connect several notions relating the structural and dynamical properties of a graph. Among them are the topological entropy coming from the vertex shift, which is related to the spectral radius of the graph's adjacency matrix, the Randić index, and the degree assortativity. We show that, among all connected graphs with the same degree sequence, the graph having maximum entropy is characterized by a hierarchical structure; namely, it satisfies a breadth-first search ordering with decreasing degrees (BFD-ordering for short). Consequently, the maximum-entropy graph necessarily has high degree assortativity; furthermore, for such a graph the degree centrality and eigenvector centrality coincide. Moreover, the notion of assortativity is related to the general Randić index. We prove that the graph that maximizes the Randić index satisfies a BFD-ordering. For trees, the converse holds as well. We also define a normalized Randić function and show that its maximum value equals the difference of Shannon entropies of two probability distributions defined on the edges and vertices of the graph based on degree correlations.

This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.

Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery. Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability, complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth, continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

The spatiotemporal inhomogeneous-homogeneous transition in the dynamics and structures of solar photospheric turbulence is studied by applying the complexity-entropy analysis to Hinode images of a vortical region of supergranular junctions in the quiet Sun. During a period of supergranular vortex expansion of 37.5 min, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the line-of-sight magnetic field and the horizontal electromagnetic energy flux display the characteristics of inverse turbulent cascade, evidenced by the formation of a large magnetic coherent structure via the merger of two small magnetic elements trapped by a long-duration vortex. Both magnetic and Poynting fluxes exhibit an admixture of chaos and stochasticity in the complexity-entropy plane, involving a temporal transition from low to high complexity and a temporal transition from high to low entropy during the period of vortex expansion, consistent with Hinode observations.

The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.

The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model for wave dynamics in nonlinear media ranging from optical fibers to Bose-Einstein condensates. Accurately estimating its parameters, which are often strongly correlated, from a single measurement remains a significant challenge. We address this problem by treating parameter estimation as an inverse problem and training a neural network to invert the NLSE mapping. We combine a fast numerical solver with a machine learning approach based on the ConvNeXt architecture and a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function. From single-shot field (density and phase) images, our model estimates three key parameters: the nonlinear coefficient $n_2$, the saturation intensity $I_{sat}$, and the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$. Trained on 100,000 simulated images, the model achieves a mean absolute error of $3.22\%$ on 12,500 unseen test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close agreement with ground-truth values. This approach provides an efficient route for characterizing nonlinear systems and has the potential to bridge theoretical modeling and experimental data when realistic noise is incorporated.

The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($<$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.

Although the dependence of convective core overshooting on mass has attracted much attention, no corresponding work exists for overshooting below a convective envelope. We aim to quantify this relationship for pre-main sequence stars of intermediate mass ranging from $1.2 M_{\mathsf{sun}}$ to $6 M_{\mathsf{sun}}$. These stars have a similar thermal and density structure, making this a suitable choice to isolate the effect of changing mass. We produce a series of two-dimensional global simulations of stars using MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. The stars that we select for this study are near the end of the pre-main sequence and are convectively unstable above 80% of their stellar radius; they thus have a convective envelope that is shallower than the current sun. For this series of stellar models, a simple scaling with luminosity, with a scaling exponent of 1/4, accounts for the increasing overshooting with stellar mass. This result has interesting similarities with the scaling found by Baraffe et al. [2023] for a range of intermediate mass and massive stars at the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) that have convective cores.

As physicists pursue precision neutrino measurements, complementary experiments covering varied oscillation landscapes have become essential for resolving current tensions in global fits. This thesis presents projected sensitivities and forecasted performance of two next-generation long-baseline experiments: DUNE and T2HK, through detailed simulations addressing fundamental questions including neutrino mass ordering, leptonic CP violation, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. We demonstrate through simulated analyses that while each experiment alone faces inherent degeneracies, their complementary features enable breakthrough projected sensitivities in both standard oscillation parameter measurements and forecasted searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The combined simulation results reveal that DUNE-T2HK synergy will be crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neutrino properties in the coming decade.

A theoretical analysis of the permissible reactions for obtaining multicomponent CdZnTeSe crystals from different compositions of starting materials was performed. The homogeneity of the distribution of the atomic composition and electrical resistance (in the dark and under illumination) of the obtained crystals was studied.

Recent experiments demonstrated that the spin state of individual atoms on surfaces can be quantum-coherently controlled through all-electric electron spin resonance. By constructing interacting arrays of atoms this results in an atomic-scale qubit platform. However, the static exchange coupling between qubits, limited lifetime and polarization of the initial state, impose significant limits on high-fidelity quantum control. We address this issue using open quantum systems simulation and quantum optimal control theory. We demonstrate the conditions under which high-fidelity operations ($\mathcal{F} \gtrsim 0.9$) are feasible in this qubit platform, and show how the Krotov method of quantum optimal control theory adapts to specific noise sources to outperform the conventional Rabi drivings. Finally, we re-examine the experimental setup used in the initial demonstration of this qubit platform and propose optimized experimental designs to maximize gate fidelity in this platform.

Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.

Droplets help organize cells by compartmentalizing biomolecules and by mediating mechanical interactions. When bridging two structures, such droplets generate capillary forces, which depend on surface properties and distance. While the forces exerted by passive liquid bridges are well understood, the role of active chemical reactions, which are often present in biological droplets, remains unclear. To elucidate this case, we study a single liquid bridge with continuous chemical turnover. These reactions control the bridge radius and lead to purely repulsive forces-contrasting with the typically attractive forces in passive systems. Our results reveal how chemical activity can fundamentally alter forces generated by liquid bridges, which could be exploited by cells.

Data assimilation is widely used in many disciplines such as meteorology, oceanography, and robotics to estimate the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and general method to perform data assimilation using diffusion models pre-trained for emulating dynamical systems. Our method builds on particle filters, a class of data assimilation algorithms, and does not require any further training. As a guiding example throughout this work, we illustrate our methodology on GenCast, a diffusion-based model that generates global ensemble weather forecasts.

Based on the cryptocurrency market dynamics, this study presents a general methodology for analyzing evolving correlation structures in complex systems using the $q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient \rho(q,s). By extending traditional metrics, this approach captures correlations at varying fluctuation amplitudes and time scales. The method employs $q$-dependent minimum spanning trees ($q$MSTs) to visualize evolving network structures. Using minute-by-minute exchange rate data for 140 cryptocurrencies on Binance (Jan 2021-Oct 2024), a rolling window analysis reveals significant shifts in $q$MSTs, notably around April 2022 during the Terra/Luna crash. Initially centralized around Bitcoin (BTC), the network later decentralized, with Ethereum (ETH) and others gaining prominence. Spectral analysis confirms BTC's declining dominance and increased diversification among assets. A key finding is that medium-scale fluctuations exhibit stronger correlations than large-scale ones, with $q$MSTs based on the latter being more decentralized. Properly exploiting such facts may offer the possibility of a more flexible optimal portfolio construction. Distance metrics highlight that major disruptions amplify correlation differences, leading to fully decentralized structures during crashes. These results demonstrate $q$MSTs' effectiveness in uncovering fluctuation-dependent correlations, with potential applications beyond finance, including biology, social and other complex systems.

Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.

This paper proposes an orthogonality-constrained modal search (OCMS) method for estimating modal wavenumbers and modal depth functions using a vertical linear array (VLA). Under the assumption of a known sound speed profile, OCMS leverages the orthogonality of distinct modal depth functions to extract both the modal depth functions and their corresponding wavenumbers, even when the VLA and a monochromatic sound source remain this http URL performance of OCMS is evaluated through numerical simulations under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different VLA apertures, varying numbers of VLA elements, VLA tilt and sound speed profile (SSP) uncertainty. The results demonstrate that OCMS is robust against noise, VLA aperture variations, and changes in the number of VLA elements, meanwhile, the algorithm maintains reliable performance when SSP uncertainty < 1 m/s and VLA tilt angle <5°. Furthermore, the effectiveness of OCMS is validated using SwellEx96 experimental data. The relative error between the modal wavenumbers derived from experimental data and those computed via Kraken is on the order of $10^{-4}$.

Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.

Braiding of dynamical eigenvalues of Hermitian bosonic Kitaev chains
Heming Wang, Shanhui Fan
Comments:

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and the spectra are restricted to be real. However, the dynamics of the underlying fields may allow complex eigenvalues and therefore create the possibility of braiding structures. Here we study the braiding of dynamical eigenvalues in quantum systems by considering Hermitian bosonic Kitaev chains with multiple bands. The dynamics of the quantum fields in these systems are described by their dynamic matrices, which have complex eigenvalues. We show that there are symmetry constraints imposed on these dynamic eigenvalues. Despite these constraints, braiding is possible for frequencies within the effective gain and loss regions of the complex plane. We explicitly construct two- and three-strand braidings using the exceptional points found in the system and discuss possible implementations.

Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate.

A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.

Atomistic mechanisms of oxidation and chlorine corrosion in Ni-based superalloys: The role of boron and light interstitial segregation

Hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the interaction of light interstitials in multi-element Ni-based alloys. We show that light interstitials such as boron and oxygen fundamentally alter interfacial chemistry by reshaping alloy-element distribution and segregation. Oxygen adsorption drove boron migration from the grain boundary to the free surface, where it co-enriched with Cr, Fe, and Mo and formed BO3 trigonal motifs embedded within mixed-metal oxide networks. Oxygen also promoted M-O-M chain formation, including Nb2O5 clusters at the free surface. In the absence of oxygen, boron segregated to the grain boundary, altering local metal chemistry and underscoring a dynamic, environment-sensitive behavior. Following chlorine exposure, the oxidized surfaces retained strong O-mediated connectivity while forming new Cl-M associations, particularly with Nb and Cr, and exhibited further surface enrichment in Cr, Fe, and Mo. High-temperature MD simulations revealed a dynamic tug-of-war: chlorine exerted upward pull and disrupted weakly anchored sites, while Nb- and BO3-rich oxide motifs resisted deformation. A new stabilization mechanism was identified in which subsurface boron atoms anchored overlying Cr centers, suppressing their mobility and mitigating chlorine-driven displacement. These results demonstrate boron's dual role as a modifier of alloy-element segregation and a stabilizer of oxide networks, and identify Nb as a key element in reinforcing cohesion under halogen attack. More broadly, this study highlights the need to track light interstitial cross-talk and solute migration under reactive conditions, offering atomistic criteria for designing corrosion-resistant surface chemistries in Ni-based superalloys exposed to halogenated or oxidative environments.

Scattering-asymmetry control with ultrafast electron wave packet shaping

Comments:
22 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)
Scattering of a tightly focused electron beam by an atom forms one of the bases of modern electron microscopy. A fundamental symmetry breaking occurs when the target atom is displaced from the beam center. This displacement results in a deflection of the beam and an asymmetric angular distribution of the scattered electrons. Here we propose a concept to control the sign and magnitude of the scattering asymmetry by shaping the incident high-energy electron wave packet in momentum space on the atto- to picosecond time scale. The shaping controls the ultrafast real-space dynamics of the wave packet, shifting the balance between two competing contributions of the impact-parameter-dependent quantum interference and the momentum distribution of the wave packet on the target. We find a strong sensitivity of the elastic scattering on the wave packet properties, an effect that will allow wave-packet and target characterization in ultrafast electron microscopy.

Time-variant systems have recently garnered considerable attention due to their unique potentials in manipulating electromagnetic waves. Here, a novel class of topological spacetime crystals is introduced, with a traveling-wave modulation that mimics certain aspects of physical motion. Challenging intuition, our findings reveal that, even though such systems rely on a linear momentum bias, it is feasible to engineer an internal angular momentum and non-trivial topological phases by leveraging the symmetry of its structural elements. Furthermore, these platforms exhibit a gauge degree of freedom associated with the arbitrariness in the choice of the coordinate transformation that eliminates the time dependence of the system Hamiltonian. The topology of the system is intricately governed by a synthetic magnetic potential whose field lines can be controlled by manipulating material anisotropy. Remarkably, the proposed spacetime crystals host an unconventional class of scattering-immune edge states, whose oscillation frequency adapts continuously along the propagation path, shaped by the geometric attributes of the path itself.

Stoichiometry preservation and generalization of Bilger mixture fraction for non-premixed combustion with differential molecular diffusion

The Bilger mixture fraction is a widely used parameter in non-premixed combustion when considering differential molecular diffusion, a prevalent phenomenon in hydrogen or hydrogen-blended fuel combustion. The property of stoichiometry preservation of mixture fractions is investigated. Two different Bilger mixture fraction formulations are clarified. It is found that they belong to a class of one-parameter generalized mixture fraction definitions discovered in this work. Specific definitions from the class of mixture fractions are compared for hydrocarbon fuels. The comparison shows that the difference can be significant. An optimal mixture fraction definition is sought from the general definitions by minimizing its deviation from the desired properties. The obtained optimal mixture fractions show overall better preservation of stoichiometry than Bilger's definitions. The extension of the generalized mixture fraction to other fuels that contain nitrogen (like ammonia $\mathrm{NH_3}$) or sulfur (like hydrogen sulfide $\mathrm{H_2S}$) is also demonstrated.

This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.

Transformation and amplification of light modulated by a traveling wave with a relatively low frequency
M. Sumetsky

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
The behavior of electromagnetic waves in media modulated in both time and space, extensively studied decades ago, has recently attracted renewed attention. In this work, we address a central question of this research: can light at an initial frequency $\omega_{0}$ be amplified solely by pumping with a traveling wave of much lower frequency $\omega_{p} \ll \omega_{0}$? In general, the bandwidth of the modulation-induced optical frequency-comb spectrum increases substantially when the phase velocity of the traveling wave, $v_{p}$, approaches the phase velocity of light, $v_{0}$. However, in realistic photonic waveguides, the resulting amplification remains negligible due to the unfeasible modulation strengths and waveguide parameters required. In contrast, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator with a traveling wave of frequency $\omega_{p}$ and phase velocity $v_{p}$ much smaller than the frequency $\omega_{0}$ and phase velocity $v_{0}$ of light can produce strong amplification. This effect is accompanied by conversion into multiple comb lines within a relatively narrow frequency band.

EarthquakeNPP: A Benchmark for Earthquake Forecasting with Neural Point Processes

For decades, classical point process models, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, have been widely used for forecasting the event times and locations of earthquakes. Recent advances have led to Neural Point Processes (NPPs), which promise greater flexibility and improvements over such classical models. However, the currently-used benchmark for NPPs does not represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community, since it contains data leakage and omits the largest earthquake sequence from the region. Additionally, initial earthquake forecasting benchmarks fail to compare NPPs with state-of-the-art forecasting models commonly used in seismology. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP: a collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake data, accompanied by an implementation of the state-of-the-art forecasting model: ETAS. The datasets cover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from 1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. Benchmarking experiments, using both log-likelihood and generative evaluation metrics widely recognised in seismology, show that none of the five NPPs tested outperform ETAS. These findings suggest that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable for practical earthquake forecasting. Nonetheless, EarthquakeNPP provides a platform to foster future collaboration between the seismology and machine learning communities.

Gain-Momentum Locking in Chiral-Gain Media

Comments:

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Conventional optical materials are characterized by either a dissipative response, which results in polarization-independent absorption, or by a gain response that leads to wave amplification. In this work, we study a peculiar class of materials with chiral-gain properties, where gain selectively amplifies waves of one polarization handedness, while dissipation suppresses the opposite handedness. We uncover a novel phenomenon, gain-momentum locking, at the boundary of chiral-gain media, where surface plasmons are amplified or attenuated based on their direction of propagation. This effect, driven by the interplay between spin-momentum locking and polarization-sensitive non-Hermitian responses, enables precise control over unidirectional wave propagation. Our findings open the door to photonic devices with unprecedented capabilities, such as lossless unidirectional edge-wave propagation and the generation of light with intrinsic orbital angular momentum.

The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.

Manipulating terahertz phonon-polariton in the ultrastrong coupling regime with bound states in the continuum

The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise to phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information, offering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological engineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form and manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling regime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between the phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI<sub>3</sub> film and the metallic bound states in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be continuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the parameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode evolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully extracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the MaPbI<sub>3</sub> film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This work not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz phonon-polaritons.

This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor-Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.

Homophily -- the tendency of individuals to interact with similar others -- shapes how networks form and function. Yet existing approaches typically collapse homophily to a single scale, either one parameter for the whole network or one per community, thereby detaching it from other structural features. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy random graph model that moves beyond these limits, capturing homophily across all social scales in the network, with parameters for each group size. The framework decomposes homophily into within- and across-group contributions, recovering the stochastic block model as a special case. As an exponential-family model, it fits empirical data and enables inference of group-level variation of homophily that aggregate metrics miss. The group-dependence of homophily substantially impacts network percolation thresholds, altering predictions for epidemic spread, information diffusion, and the effectiveness of interventions. Ignoring such heterogeneity risks systematically misjudging connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.

Comparison of lubrication theory and Stokes flow models in step bearings with flow separation

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large gradients in the surface geometry. We present an analytic solution to the Reynolds equation in a piecewise-linear domain alongside a more general finite difference solution. For the Stokes equations, we use a finite difference solution for the biharmonic stream-velocity formulation. We compare the fluid velocity, pressure, and resistance for various step bearing geometries in the lubrication and Stokes limits. We find that the solutions to the Reynolds equation do not capture flow separation resulting from large cross-film pressure gradients. Flow separation and corner flow recirculation in step bearings are explored further; we consider the effect of smoothing large gradients in the surface geometry in order to recover limits under which the lubrication and Stokes approximations converge.

Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.

Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.

In gamma spectrometers with variable spectroscopic performance across many channels (e.g., many pixels or voxels), a tradeoff exists between including data from successively worse-performing readout channels and increasing efficiency. Brute-force calculation of the optimal set of included channels is exponentially infeasible as the number of channels grows, and approximate methods are required. In this work, we present a data-driven framework for attempting to find near-optimal sets of included detector channels. The framework leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn the behavior of gamma spectra across the detector, and clusters similarly-performing detector channels together. Performance comparisons are then made between spectra with channel clusters removed, which is more feasible than brute force. The framework is general and can be applied to arbitrary, user-defined performance metrics depending on the application. We apply this framework to optimizing gamma spectra measured by H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which exhibit variable performance across their crystal volumes. In particular, we show several examples optimizing various performance metrics for uranium and plutonium gamma spectra in nondestructive assay for nuclear safeguards, and explore trends in performance vs.\ parameters such as clustering algorithm type. We also compare the NMF+clustering pipeline to several non-machine-learning algorithms, including several greedy algorithms. Overall, we find that the NMF+clustering pipeline tends to find the best-performing set of detector voxels, significantly improving over the un-optimized spectra, but that a greedy accumulation of spectra segmented by detector depth can in some cases give similar performance improvements in much less computation time.

The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.

Emerging carbon capture and storage (CCS) markets face critical challenges in developing systematic methodologies to assess geological CO2 storage potential under conditions of limited data availability, evolving regulatory frameworks, and nascent infrastructure development. This study establishes an assessment framework designed for lower-maturity CCS regions, using Poland as a representative case study to demonstrate methodology application and validate framework effectiveness. The framework integrates geological characterization, storage capacity assessment, regulatory analysis, and socio-economic evaluation through a structured approach adaptable to diverse global contexts. Poland's coal-reliant economy exemplifies the decarbonization challenges facing emerging CCS regions while meeting European Union climate mandates. The country's geological setting offers substantial sequestration opportunities across three major sedimentary regions. Through multidisciplinary analysis synthesizing scattered geological data, policy developments, CCUS value chain, and stakeholder perspectives, we systematically evaluate CO2 storage potential. Onshore saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields provide significant storage capacity, while offshore Baltic Basin sites face logistical and environmental regulatory constraints. Current assessments encounter critical limitations, including sparse data, restricted research access, and inadequate industry-academia collaboration, preventing basin-scale analyses from advancing to higher storage readiness levels and undermining business decision-making reliability. This study contributes a replicable methodology extending beyond Poland to lower-maturity CCS regions worldwide. The framework provides decision-makers with systematic tools for storage assessment, policy development, and stakeholder engagement, supporting evidence-based CCS deployment strategies.

Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-Pérot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.

Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.

The space of high-beta, approximately quasiaxisymmetric, large-aspect-ratio stellarator configurations is explored using an inverse coordinate approach and a quadratic polynomial ansatz for the flux function, following the method of Palumbo, extended by Hernandes and Clemente. This approach yields a system of nonlinear ODEs that, when solved, give equilibria exhibiting positive or negative triangularity, cusps, and (in an extreme limit) current singularities. It is shown that a cubic ansatz may also be used, but that polynomials of degree four or higher will lead to overdetermination.

Subjects:

STACIE (STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator) is a novel algorithm and Python package that delivers robust, uncertainty-aware estimates of autocorrelation integrals from time-correlated data. While its primary application is deriving transport properties from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, STACIE is equally applicable to time-correlated data in other scientific fields. A key feature of STACIE is its ability to provide robust and accurate estimates without requiring manual adjustment of hyperparameters. Additionally, one can follow a simple protocol to prepare sufficient simulation data to achieve a desired relative error of the transport property. We demonstrate its application by estimating the ionic electrical conductivity of a NaCl-water electrolyte solution. We also present a massive synthetic benchmark dataset to rigorously validate STACIE, comprising 15360 sets of time-correlated inputs generated with diverse covariance kernels with known autocorrelation integrals. STACIE is open source and available on GitHub and PyPI, with comprehensive documentation and examples.

This work demonstrates quasi-vertical beta-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) fabricated on c-plane sapphire using an all-LPCVD, plasma-free process integrating epitaxial growth of high-quality beta-Ga2O3 and in-situ Ga-assisted etching. A 6.3 micron-thick (-201)-oriented beta-Ga2O3 layer was grown on c-sapphire with a 6-degree miscut, comprising a 3.15 micron moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer and a heavily doped (1e19 cm^-3) contact layer on a UID buffer. Mesa isolation used Ga-assisted LPCVD etching, producing a 60° inclined mesa sidewalls with an etch depth of 3.6 micron. SBDs showed excellent forward J-V behavior: 1.22 V turn-on, 1.29 ideality factor, and 0.83 eV barrier height. Minimum differential specific on-resistance was 8.6 mOhm*cm^2 with high current density (252 A/cm^2 at 5 V). C-V profiling revealed uniform doping at 2.1e17 cm^-3. J-V-T from 25 C to 250 C confirmed thermionic emission. Barrier height increased from 0.80 to 1.16 eV, and ideality factor from 1.31 to 1.42. Reverse leakage current remained low, increasing from ~5e-6 A/cm^2 to ~1e-4 A/cm^2; Ion/Ioff decreased from ~1e7 to 5e5. Breakdown voltages with moderately doped (2.1e17 cm^-3) drift layer ranged between 73 and 100 V, with corresponding fields of 1.66 to 1.94 MV/cm. These results highlight the potential of LPCVD-grown and etched beta-Ga2O3 devices for high-performance power electronic applications.

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been applied to interpret deep learning model results. However, applications that integrate XAI with established hydrologic knowledge for process understanding remain limited. Here we show that XAI method, applied at point-scale, could be used for cross-scale aggregation of hydrologic responses, a fundamental question in scaling problems, using hydrologic connectivity as a demonstration. Soil moisture and its movement generated by physically based hydrologic model were used to train a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, whose impacts of inputs were evaluated by XAI methods. Our results suggest that XAI-based classification can effectively identify the differences in the functional roles of various sub-regions at watershed scale. The aggregated XAI results could be considered as an explicit and quantitative indicator of hydrologic connectivity development, offering insights to hydrological organization. This framework could be used to facilitate aggregation of other geophysical responses to advance process understandings.

Photoluminescent color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are powerful nanoscale solid-state quantum sensors that are explored in a plethora of quantum technologies. Methods for integrating them into macroscopic structures that improve their sensitivity and enable their large-scale deployment are highly sought after. Here, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced photoluminescence (PL) of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and hBN nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in polymer-based thin-film optical cavities on the centimeter scale. The cavity resonances efficiently modulate the spectral PL peak position of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in FNDs across the NV PL spectrum and lead to an up to 2.9-fold Purcell-enhancement of the NV PL decay rate. The brightness of hBN NPs increases by up to a factor of three and the PL decay rate is enhanced by up to 13-fold inside the cavities. Finally, we find a 4.8 times improved magnetic field sensitivity of 20 nm FNDs in thin-film cavities due to cavity-enhanced optically detected magnetic resonance contrast and PL brightness. Our study demonstrates a low-cost and scalable method for the fabrication of quantum sensor-doped thin-film cavities, which is an important step toward the development of advanced quantum sensing technologies.

Continuous Recovery of Phase from Single Interferogram

Comments:
33 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX, typos corrected, one column format
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
A new method for phase recovery from a single two-beam interferogram is presented. Conventional approaches, relying on trigonometric inversion followed by phase unfolding and unwrapping, are hindered by discontinuities typically addressed through intricate algorithms. Our method bypasses the unfolding and unwrapping, instead formulating a first-order differential equation directly relating the phase to the interferogram. Integration of this equation enables continuous retrieval of phase along any straight path. Representing a new class of analytical tools for single-interferogram phase retrieval, this approach is derived from first principles and accommodates both Newton-type and Fizeau-type interferograms. Its performance is demonstrated on multiple idealized synthetic interferograms of increasing complexity, validating against the known seed phase.

On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)
The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.

We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.

Monolayers of transition metal dichacogenides show strong second-order nonlinearity and symmetry-driven selection rules from their three-fold lattice symmetry. This process resembles the valley-contrasting selection rules for photoluminescence in these materials. However, the underlying physical mechanisms fundamentally differ since second harmonic generation is a coherent process, whereas photoluminescence is incoherent, leading to distinct interactions with photonic nanoresonators. In this study, we investigate the far- field circular polarization properties of second harmonic generation from MoS$_2$ monolayers resonantly interacting with spherical gold nanoparticles. Our results indicate that the coherence of the second harmonic allows its polarization to be mostly preserved, unlike in an incoherent process, where the polarization is scrambled. These findings provide important insights for future applications in valleytronics and quantum nanooptics, where both coherent and incoherent processes can be probed in such hybrid systems without altering sample geometry or operational wavelength.

This approach preserves the electromagnetic structure of the interaction while exploiting scale separation for computational effi ciency. Unlike quasistatic methods, GEM-PIC does not have to distinguish between beam and streaming particles, allowing a self-consistent treatment of particle trapping. The EM-PIC algorithm allows for highly effi cient and accurate simulations of plasma-based wakefield acceleration.

MesoNet: A Fundamental Principle for Multi-Representation Learning in Complex Chemical Systems
Jinming Fan, Chao Qian, Shaodong Zhou
Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
Accurate prediction of molecular properties in complex chemical systems is crucial for accelerating material discovery and chemical innovation. However, current computational methods often struggle to capture the intricate compositional interplay across complex chemical systems, from intramolecular bonds to intermolecular forces. In this work, we introduce MesoNet, a novel framework founded on the principle of multi-representation learning and specifically designed for multi-molecule modeling. The core innovation of MesoNet lies in the construction of context-aware representation-dynamically enriched atomic descriptors generated via Neural Circuit Policies. These parameters efficiently capture both intrinsic atomic properties and their dynamic compositional context through a cross-attention mechanism spanning both intramolecular and intermolecular message passing. Driven by this mechanism, the influence of the mixed system is progressively applied to each molecule and atom, making message passing both efficient and meaningful. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse public datasets, spanning both pure components and mixtures, demonstrate that MesoNet achieves superior accuracy and enhanced chemical interpretability for molecular properties. This work establishes a powerful, interpretable approach for modeling compositional complexity, aiming to advance chemical simulation and design.

Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior

Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.

We consider active Brownian particles that intermittently switch between active and inactive states. Such behavior is ubiquitous at all scales, from bacteria to animals and in artificial active systems. We derive exact expressions for key transport properties, including velocity autocorrelations and diffusion coefficients, and demonstrate that particle dispersion is highly sensitive to minute details, such as whether the memory of active orientation is retained across a stop event. Extending the model to include minimal metabolic dynamics, we show that the average survival time of the particle is maximized at (i)~an optimal stopping frequency and (ii)~a non-trivial optimal diffusivity, which itself depends on the stopping frequency.

Broken detailed balance in driven macroscopic capillary self-assembly

Subjects:
Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
Macroscopic objects supported by surface tension at the fluid interface can self-assemble through the action of capillary forces arising from interfacial deformations. The resulting self-assembled structures are typically ordered but remain trapped in one of potentially many metastable states in the capillary energy landscape in the absence of external forces. In contrast, microscopic colloidal systems leverage both thermal and active fluctuations to overcome energy barriers, enabling transitions between microstates of the system. We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface. By tracking all microstate transitions experimentally, we find that the system is endowed with a non-zero entropy production rate reflecting broken detailed balance and the system's departure from equilibrium. Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with simulations of a many-body active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, pointing to universal features of active and driven self-assembly across scales. These findings invite a corresponding investigation at the microscale using colloids that are themselves active or are placed in a wider class of athermal environments such as bacterial baths.

Lossless Postselected Quantum Metrology with Quasi-pure Mixed States

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optics (physics.optics)
Postselection can compress the metrological information and improve sensitivity in the presence of certain types of technical noise. Postselected quantum metrology with pure states has been significantly advanced recently. However, extending this framework to mixed states leads to formidable challenges, such as the difficulty in searching for lossless postselection measurements or even the loss of metrological information. In this work, we leverage the intuition for the lossless postselection of pure states and generalize the theory to the lossless postselection of a class of mixed states, dubbed quasi-pure states. We illustrate our findings in postselected quantum imaging, unitary estimation problems, and show that the quasi-pure structure can be universally engineered through only classical correlation with an ancilla. Our findings extend the utility of postselection techniques to scenarios with decoherence and also offer new perspectives to foundational questions in quantum information geometry.

The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.

The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.

Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for learning communities in time-evolving networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We consider the supra-Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the supra-Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.

In the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}], we investigated the degrees of freedom in NGR types that are of interest in describing gravity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. In this work, we focus on unveiling those numbers in all other types to complete the analysis of NGR. After providing the Hamiltonian formulation of NGR and considering in detail the regularity of NGR, we perform the analysis of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9. We reveal that the degrees of freedom of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 are five, zero (purely topological system in bulk spacetime), and three, respectively. Type 4 and Type 9 have second-class constraint densities only, whereas Type 7 has first-class constraint densities only. In every type, no bifurcation occurs. In particular, Type 4 and Type 7 are irregular and provide specific examples of handling irregular systems. Since no general method is known for treating an irregular system, this work contributes to furthering the understanding of irregular systems.

In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.

Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.

Dynami-CAL GraphNet: A Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network Conserving Linear and Angular Momentum for Dynamical Systems
Vinay Sharma, Olga Fink
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science (cs.CE); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for predicting behaviors and inferring physical properties in natural and engineered environments. Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.

Imaging cross-degree-of-freedom structures in biphoton spatial-polarization hyperentanglement

Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement across more than one degree of freedom (DoF), is a valuable resource in photonic quantum technology. Although hyperentangled states inherently facilitate access to high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, their distinguishing feature lies in the cross-DoF structures beyond independent entanglement in each DoF, which can be leveraged to enable novel and robust information processing schemes. In particular, for a spatial-polarization hyperentangled state generated from spontaneous parametric downconversion, the resulting polarization entanglement is structured by the spatial distribution of all interacting optical fields. Characterizing such cross-DoF structures is a crucial step towards employing hyperentangled states for practical quantum applications. Here, by performing polarization state tomography on all spatially correlated photon pairs, we have, for the first time, resolved the full-field spatial-polarization structure in a 251-dimensional hyperentangled biphoton state. We observe an entire class of near-maximally polarization-entangled states with an average concurrence of $0.8303 \pm 0.0004$, characterized by biphoton polarization phases that exhibit radial and linear gradients induced by the transverse momenta of the down-converted photons and the pump beam, respectively. Our study lays important groundwork for further exploiting the high dimensionality and cross-DoF correlations in hyperentangled states for future quantum technologies.

Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Optics (physics.optics)
Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is fundamentally quantum or classical is essential for building accurate theoretical models and guiding experimental design. Here, we address this question in the context of polaritonic spectra, and report an intriguing new feature: the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the primary resonant polariton splitting, originating from vacuum field fluctuations. We show that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule limit under permutationally symmetrical initial-state constraint and that it follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary polariton splitting. This establishes a novel mechanism by which a quantum feature (the twin-polariton) can be tuned through a classical one (the primary polariton), offering new opportunities to probe and control the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.

Photo-evaporation shapes the observed radii of small exoplanets and constrains the underlying distributions of atmospheric and core masses. However, the diversity of atmospheric chemistries corresponding to these distributions remains unelucidated. We develop a first-principles carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-sulfur-silicon (CHOSSi) outgassing model that accounts for non-ideal gas behavior (via fugacities) at high pressures, as well as the tendency for water and hydrogen to dissolve in melt (via solubility laws). We use data-driven radius valley constraints to establish the relationship between the atmospheric surface pressures and melt temperatures of sub-Neptunes. Sub-Neptunes with less massive rocky cores retain less of their primordial hydrogen envelopes, which leads to less heat retention and diminished melt temperatures at the surfaces of these cores. Lower melt temperatures lead thermodynamically to the dominance of carbon-, oxygen-, sulfur- and silicon-bearing molecules over molecular hydrogen, which naturally produce a diversity of mean molecular weights. Our geochemical outgassing calculations robustly predict a gradient of mean molecular weight across the radius valley, where the strength of this gradient is primarily driven by the oxygen fugacity of the molten cores and not by the carbon enrichment (or "metallicity") of the atmosphere. Smaller sub-Neptunes are predicted to have less hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The precise relationship between the observed and outgassed chemistries requires an understanding of how convection near the core interacts with large-scale atmospheric circulation (driven by stellar heating) near the photosphere, as well as the influence of photochemistry.

Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics

This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.

A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries
Xiao Han, Axel van de Walle
Subjects:
Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.

We present a constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA method generally produces larger Hubbard U interaction values compared to conventional approaches. When applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$ , s-cRPA yields interaction parameters that align more closely with those required within DFT+U to reproduce the experimentally observed insulating state, addressing the metallic behaviour predicted by standard density functionals. We examine the issue of negative interaction values encountered in the projec- tor cRPA method for filled d-shells. We show that s-cRPA provides improved numerical stability by preserving electron number conservation, a constraint that is violated in the projector cRPA method. The s-cRPA approach addresses some limitations of standard cRPA methods, particularly the tendency to underestimate U values, suggesting its potential utility for the community. Addi- tionally, we have enhanced our implementation to include computation of multi-centre interactions for analysing spatial decay and developed an efficient low-scaling variant employing a compressed Matsubara grid to obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.

Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.

We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.

20 pages, 11 figures. A preprint on using a unified physics-informed neural network framework to model predator-prey dynamics
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Ecological systems exhibit complex multi-scale dynamics that challenge traditional modeling. New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.

Compared with Hermitian theory, non-Hermitian physics offers a fundamentally different mathematical framework, enabling the observation of topological phenomena that have no analogue in Hermitian systems. Among these, the exceptional point (EP) ring stands out as a quintessential topological feature unique to non-Hermitian systems. In this study, we employ single-photon interferometry to overcome the experimental challenge of precise phase control in quantum systems, thereby enabling a complete simulation of the non-Hermitian EP ring in three-dimensional parameter space without invoking any additional symmetry assumptions. By measuring the non-Hermitian dynamics in three-dimensional parameter space, we determine the system's eigenstates, which allows us to characterize the topological band structure of the system under different conditions. We describe the topological properties of the EP ring by extracting the Chern number and Berry phase for different parameter manifolds and observe the topological critical phenomena of the system. Our work paves the way for further exploration of topological non-Hermitian systems.

Title:
Effective decoupling of mutations and the resulting loss of biodiversity caused by environmental change
Ruixi Huang, David Waxman
Comments:
63 pages consisting of manuscript (22 pages) and SI (41 pages) in a single document
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.
