Title:
Hypergeometry from $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-Symmetry: Feynman Integrals in One and Two Dimensions

Feynman integrals with generic propagator powers in one and two spacetime dimensions are investigated from various perspectives. In particular, we argue that the class of track integrals at any loop order is fixed by the recently found $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of Yangian type. All track integrals up to six external points (and four loops) are bootstrapped explicitly as well as the full family of one-loop integrals at any multiplicity. Moreover, the triangle tracks at generic loop order, which constitute the most generic family of track-type integrals, are bootstrapped in this way. The results are compared to the direct evaluation via a `spectral transform' from the integrability toolbox that turns out to be particularly efficient for position-space tree integrals in lower dimensions. We prove that all $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of these integrals can be derived from the framework of Aomoto--Gelfand hypergeometric functions, which applies to integrals in one and two dimensions. Finally, we also demonstrate the method's applicability to conformal integrals by deriving the complete results for all comb-channel conformal partial waves as well as the conformal double-box integral. We explicitly go through all examples of the above integrals in 1D and then provide a straightforward recipe for how to read off their 2D counterparts.

Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.

Linear Higher-Order Maxwell-Einstein-Scalar Theories

In the context of the Higher-Order Maxwell-Einstein-Scalar (HOMES) theories, which are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms and $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we study two broad subclasses: the first is up to linear in $R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$, $\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu\phi$, $\nabla_\rho{F}_{\mu\nu}$ and up to quadratic in the vector field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$; the second is up to linear in $\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu\phi$, contains no second derivatives of vector field and metric, but allows for arbitrary functions/powers of $F_{\mu\nu}$. Under these assumptions, we systematically derive the most general form of the action that leads to second-order (or lower) equations of motion. We prove that, among 41 possible terms in the first subclass, only four independent higher-derivative terms are allowed: the kinetic gravity braiding term $G_3(\phi,X)\Box\phi$ in the scalar sector with $X = -\nabla_\mu\phi \nabla^\mu\phi / 2$; the Horndeski non-minimal coupling term $w_0(\phi)R_{\beta \delta \alpha \gamma}\tilde{F}^{\alpha \beta } \tilde{F}^{\gamma \delta }$ in the vector field sector, where $\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ is the Hodge dual of $F_{\mu\nu}$; and two interaction terms between the scalar and vector field sectors: $[w_1(\phi,X) g_{\rho\sigma} + w_2(\phi,X) \nabla_{\rho}\phi \nabla_{\sigma}\phi] \nabla_\beta\nabla_\alpha\phi \, \tilde{F}^{\alpha \rho } \tilde{F}^{\beta\sigma}$. For the second subclass, which admits 11 possible terms, three of these four, excluding the Horndeski non-minimal coupling term proportional to $w_0(\phi)$, are allowed. These independent terms serve as the building blocks of each subclass of HOMES. Remarkably, there is no higher-derivative parity-violating term in either subclass. Finally, we propose a new generalization of higher-derivative interaction terms for the case of a charged complex scalar field.

Differential Equations for Wilson Loops in ABJM Theory
Takao Suyama

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We derive a system of differential equations which are satisfied by the vevs of BPS Wilson loops and 't Hooft coupling of ABJM theory. They are Picard-Fuchs equations of an algebraic curve defined by the derivative of the planar resolvent of the corresponding matrix model. The weak and strong coupling behaviors can be reproduced by their local solutions around regular singularities. We also obtain a recursion relation which can be used to determine the planar vevs of BPS Wilson loops in arbitrary representations.

Twists of four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories (SQFTs) isolate protected sectors with rich algebraic structures. We develop a unified framework for analyzing symmetries and anomalies in four-dimensional holomorphically twisted SQFTs, combiningcomplex-geometric and algebraic perspectives. This approach clarifies the connections between existing formulations in the literature and resolves several open questions left unanswered in the first installment of this series.
We place particular emphasis on theories with extended supersymmetry, where the holomorphic twist gives rise to enhanced algebraic and geometric structures. We explain how these features emerge and govern the organization of the twisted theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a superconformal deformation of the twisted theory naturally leads to the associated vertex operator algebra, clarifying how the higher algebraic structures of the holomorphically twisted theory give rise to vertex algebras structures.

Ghost-free, gauge invariant SVT generalizations of Horndeski theory

We present a new type of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories with higher derivatives of all the fields in the action, but with second order equations of motion. The higher derivative vector field is invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation and the Scalar-Tensor sector corresponds to Horndeski theory. We also present a subclass of these SVT theories with 8 free functions of $\pi$ and $X$ where the speed of the tensor and vector modes is exactly the same. In particular, the Horndeski functions $G_4(\pi,X)$ and $G_5(\pi)$ remain free, while the speed of the vector modes tracks the speed of the tensor modes. Additionally, the vector sector retains freedom through the four new functions. All the theories here shown are a generalization of the Kaluza-Klein reduction of 5D Horndeski theory, sharing the main properties in cosmology, but including new free scalar functions in the Lagrangian.

Spectral Curves with Complex Multiplication in Hermitian Matrix Models
Ali Nassar
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We show that elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM) naturally emerge in the spectral geometry of Hermitian one-matrix models in the two-cut phase. Focusing on a symmetric quartic potential, we derive the corresponding genus-one spectral curve and compute its modular $j$-invariant in closed form as a function of the quartic coupling $g$. We identify specific values of $g$ for which the elliptic curve exhibits $CM$, i.e., its endomorphism ring is larger than $\mathbb{Z}$. This establishes a direct connection between number-theoretic structures and the spectral data of random matrix ensembles.

Integrable Sigma Models and Universal Root $T\bar{T}$ Deformation via Courant-Hilbert Approach
H. Babaei-Aghbolagh, Bin Chen, Song He
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We develop a unified Courant--Hilbert framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable sigma models deformed by two couplings: a marginal one $\gamma$ and an irrelevant one $\lambda$. The integrability condition is encoded in a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) for two invariants $(P_1,P_2)$, whose general solution could be expressed through an arbitrary generating function $\ell(\tau)$. This formulation encompasses and extends known models, such as ModMax and Born-Infeld, while introducing new classes of solvable models with closed-form Lagrangians, including those with logarithmic and $q$-deformations. All resulting theories obey a universal root-$T\overline{T}$ flow equation, consistent under dimensional reduction from four-dimensional duality-invariant electrodynamics. Using perturbative expansions, we recover ModMax in the free limit, determine the $\gamma$-dependence of the coupling functions, and show how different flow equations, including a single-trace form, naturally emerge. Our results reveal deep structural connections between self-duality, integrability, and deformation dynamics across different dimensions.

Gyromagnetic ratio and Pauli form factor in anisotropic QED$_{2 + 1}$ at one-loop

The gyromagnetic ratio and Pauli form factor are important quantities that characterize the electric and magnetic moment distribution of a particle. The experimentally measured value for the gyromagnetic ratio or the spin g-factor of an electron in a vacuum agrees remarkably well with theoretical predictions, making it one of the biggest successes of quantum field theory. However, these factors may get modified compared to their vacuum counterparts due to the interaction present in the system. Motivating from that, in this article, we investigate the effects of interactions within the framework of $2+1$ dimensional Proca quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate how the g-factor and Pauli form factors change with the electron's Fermi velocity and the mass of the vector fields within Proca quantum electrodynamics.

Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries: Noether Realization & Algebraic Structure in Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory
Nicolas Cresto
Comments:
PhD Thesis. 231 pages
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
This thesis deals with the phase space realization of asymptotic higher spin symmetries, in 4d asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the gravitational case for instance, these symmetries generalize the BMS algebra to include an infinite tower of symmetry generators constructed from tensors on the sphere of arbitrary high rank $s$.
Building on a first series of results on their canonical representation, we develop the necessary framework to define Noether charges for all degrees $s$. Importantly, we construct these charges out of a `holomorphic' asymptotic symplectic potential, such that we obtain an infinite collection of charges conserved in the absence of radiation. The classical symmetry is then realized non-perturbatively and non-linearly in the so-called holomorphic coupling constant, generalizing the perturbative linear and quadratic approach known so far. The infinitesimal action defines a symmetry algebroid which reduces to a symmetry algebra at non-radiative cuts of $\mathscr{I}$. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic equations of motion in vacuum. We expose our results for Yang-Mills, General Relativity, and Einstein-Yang-Mills theories.
This canonical analysis comes hand in hand with an in-depth study of the algebraic structure underlying the symmetry. We reveal several Lie algebroid and Lie algebra brackets, which connect the Carrollian, celestial and twistorial realizations.
For the specific case of non-abelian gauge theory, we also investigate how the asymptotic expansion around null infinity of the full Yang-Mills equations of motion in vacuum can be recast in terms of the higher spin charge aspects.

Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.

We study the one-loop renormalization of massless matter fields in the $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$ representation of the Restricted Lorentz Group. The model is constructed with the most general parity-invariant kinetic term and includes all the independent dimension-4 parity-invariant self-interactions available in this representation. Its free Lagrangian reproduces the massless limit of three theories previously studied in the literature: the Joos-Weinberg, the Shay-Good/Hammer-McDonald-Pursey, and the Klein-Gordon-like one, as particular cases. The model is found to be renormalizable.

On the Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field with Magnetic Monopoles
Kanan Anwar
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
We present a covariant framework for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of magnetic monopoles. Building on the two-potential formalism of Cabibbo and Ferrari, which treats electric and magnetic sources on equal footing and reveals a $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we extend the theory into the quantum domain. Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.

We compute the potential-graviton contributions to the conservative scattering angle of two non-spinning bodies in maximal supergravity at fifth order in Newton's constant, including second-order self-force effects. Our goal is to tackle the challenging integrals arising at this order in Einstein gravity, but within the technically simpler framework of supergravity. The calculation employs the scattering-amplitude framework, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. The final result is expressed as a series expansion around the static limit, thereby avoiding the explicit evaluation of intricate special functions. This series solution for the master integrals applies, as well, to the corresponding computation in general relativity. Remarkably, we observe nontrivial cancellations among contributions associated with Calabi-Yau integrals, alongside a distinct contribution governed by a Heun differential equation.

We construct an exact solution in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, describing multi-centered rotating black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges, obtained via dimensional reduction from five-dimensional Einstein gravity. This generalizes the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to the rotating case, and extends the recent multi-centered rotating black hole solutions of Teo and Wan to configurations with unequal electric and magnetic charges. The resulting spacetimes are free of curvature singularities, conical defects, Dirac-Misner strings, and closed timelike curves, both on and outside the horizons, provided that the black holes have either aligned or anti-aligned spin orientations.

We consider the thermodynamic properties of a rotating gas of fermions. We begin by constructing the thermodynamic potential $\Phi$ and its associated current $\phi^\mu$ within the grand canonical ensemble of a macroscopic rigidly rotating body, where the ensemble parameters are the temperature $T_0$ and chemical potential $\mu_0$ on the rotation axis, as well as the rotation angular velocity $\Omega_0$. We then consider the problem of local thermodynamics, where the thermodynamic state is defined by the local temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$, as well as the local spin potential tensor, $\Omega_{\mu\nu}$. We find the thermodynamic pressure $P$, given as the sum of the usual classical (non-quantum) pressure and other corrections due to the spin potential and the kinematic state of the fluid. We compute the associated entropy, charge and spin densities, and show they are consistent with the Euler relation.

Critical Points and Syzygies for Feynman Integrals

Subjects:

We investigate a novel theoretical structure underlying the computation of integration-by-parts relations between Feynman integrals via syzygy-based methods. Building on insights from intersection theory, we analyze the large-$\epsilon$ limit of dimensional regularization on the maximal cut, showing that total derivatives vanish on the critical locus of the logarithm of the Baikov polynomial--the locus known to govern the number of master integrals. We introduce "critical syzygies" as a distinguished subset of syzygies that captures this behavior. We show that, when the critical locus is isolated, critical syzygies generate a sufficient set of total derivatives in the large-$\epsilon$ limit. We study their structure analytically at one loop and develop a numerical approach for their construction at two loops. Our results demonstrate that critical syzygies are a valuable tool for integral reduction in cutting-edge two-loop examples, offering a novel geometric perspective on integration-by-parts relations.

We construct a variety of bound states of Dirac magnetic monopoles in product $U(1)$ gauge theories, that make up a unit charge Dirac magnetic monopole of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group. The size of the bound states is determined by the balance between the repulsive magnetic Coulomb force of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group and the attractive force from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes of the broken $U(1)$ gauge groups. These bound states are extensions of the configuration first studied in arXiv:1608.06951. We dub this type of configurations ``Magnetic Monopole Molecules'' (MMMs). Besides some illustrative examples of MMMs made of a small number of constituent magnetic monopoles, a method to combine smaller MMMs to construct larger MMMs is presented. Implications for the weak gravity conjecture are also discussed.

Differential equations are one of the main approaches to evaluate multi-loop Feynman integrals. The construction of a canonical or $\varepsilon$-factorised basis for multi-loop integrals remains a key bottleneck for this approach, especially when the differential equation involves non dlog-forms. Recently, several methods have been proposed to find $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. Many of them introduce new functions that are themselves defined as iterated integrals. If and when these iterated integrals can be explicitly evaluated in terms of other classes of functions remains an open problem. In this paper we elaborate on the recent proposal that one can use the fact that the intersection matrix computed in a canonical basis can be used to derive polynomial relations between these iterated integrals. On the one hand, we discuss properties of the canonical intersection matrix, in particular methods to determine the intersection matrix in a canonical basis. On the other hand we show how one can reduce the non-linear constraints on the iterated integrals to linear ones. We illustrate these ideas on examples involving Calabi-Yau varieties and higher-genus Riemann surfaces.

Finite Entropy Implies Finite Dimension in Quantum Gravity

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson\cite{ted95}, Fischler and Susskind\cite{fs} and particularly Bousso\cite{bousso} suggested that in the quantum theory of gravity this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made in\cite{tb}\cite{wf}. ``String theory constructions" of ``meta-stable dS states" always involve a model with an infinite number of states. The real challenge of such models is to define the asymptotic correlation functions of the space-time to which the dS space decays, and show how to isolate properties of the dS ``resonance" from those correlators. We argue that the theory of the resonance itself is adequately described, on time scales shorter than its lifetime, by a model with a finite number of states.

In this work, we investigate gauge theories in two dimensions nonperturbatively using the Hamiltonian truncation approach. Working on a spatial interval and adopting the axial gauge, we remove all gauge field degrees of freedom and express the interacting Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of the free Dirac theory, truncated at a finite energy. As a benchmark we analyse the Schwinger model, where our numerical spectra agree closely with the exact results from bosonization across a wide range of couplings, validating the construction of the Hamiltonian. We then generalize the formulation to nonabelian gauge groups and apply it to SU(3) gauge theory with a single massless Dirac fermion. These results demonstrate that gauge theories can be explored nonperturbatively using a truncated Hamiltonian that generates evolutions in ordinary time, offering a complementary alternative to lattice field theory.

Towards a Nicolai map for supergravity

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We investigate the possibility of a Nicolai map for minimal supergravity in four dimensions. Such a map would allow for the computation of quantum supergravity correlation functions in terms of flat-space correlators in an effective nonlocal bosonic theory with the help of a nonlinear field transformation, the inverse Nicolai map. Such a map is guaranteed for off-shell global supersymmetry, but local supersymmetry presents at least three obstacles for the construction. Their effects are analyzed in detail, in an attempt to set up a Nicolai map to leading order in the gravitational coupling. We find indications that the conformal factor of the metric obstructs the off-shell construction, suggesting that the unimodular variant of supergravity may do better. The on-shell supersymmetry approach, successful for super-Yang--Mills theory in its critical dimensions, also fails, because the graviton self-interaction cannot be written as a supervariation. Nevertheless, by brute force we obtain a four-parameter first-order Nicolai map fulfilling the free-action condition. For the acid test of determinant matching, however, one needs to push the general ansatz and the perturbative expansion to the second order.

Integral cubic form of 5D minimal supergravities and non-perturbative anomalies in 6D (1,0) theories

A five-dimensional minimal supergravity theory coupled to vector and hypermultiplets is specified by a set of trilinear couplings, given by an intersection form $C_{IJK}$, and gravitational couplings specified by an integer-valued vector $a_I$ and is consistent when these data define an integral cubic form. For every Calabi-Yau threefold reduction of M-theory, this condition is satisfied automatically. Via suitable redefinitions of the basis of 5D vectors, this is also shown to be the case for the circle reductions of six-dimensional anomaly-free (1,0) theories. When the 6D theory has a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge symmetry, we point out that the consistency of the circle reduction with nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_k$ holonomy is closely related to 6D constraints derived by Monnier and Moore. These constraints are extended to semidirect products with continuous gauge groups $\mathbb{Z}_k \ltimes G$ and CHL-like circle compactifications. When $\mathbb{Z}_k$ acts on anti-self-dual tensor fields of 6D supergravity, there should be a nontrivial action of holonomy on the topological Green-Schwarz terms.

We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.

In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.

Inspired by an earlier idea of Mashhoon, who suggested to relate the discrete quasinormal resonant modes of a black hole to the bound-state resonances of the corresponding inverted black-hole potential, VÃ¶lkel [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 134}, 241401 (2025)] has recently computed numerically, for the first time, the bound-state energy spectrum of the inverted Schwarzschild potential. Motivated by this intriguing work, in the present work we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical and mathematical properties of the Schwarzschild bound-state resonances. In particular, we derive closed-form compact analytical formulas for the infinite spectrum $\{E_n\}_{n=0}^{n=\infty}$ of energy eigenvalues that characterize the inverted (binding) black-hole potential. Interestingly, it is explicitly shown that our analytically derived energy spectrum of the black-hole inverted potential agrees remarkably well with the corresponding numerical data that recently appeared in the physics literature.

We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein--Maxwell--Scalar framework. The geometry, sustained solely by an electric charge \(Q\), features an infinite sequence of curvature singularity shells, with the outermost at \(r_\ast = \frac{2|Q|}{\pi}\) acting as a hard boundary for nonradial motion, while radial trajectories can access it depending on the particle's charge-to-mass ratio \(\frac{|q|}{m}\). Exploiting exact first integrals, we construct the effective potential and obtain circular orbit radii, radial epicyclic frequencies, and azimuthal precession rates. In the weak-field limit (\(r \gg |Q|\)), the motion reduces to a Coulombic system with small curvature-induced retrograde precession. At large radii, the dynamics maps to a hydrogenic system, with curvature corrections inducing perturbative energy shifts. Approaching \(r_\ast\), the potential diverges, producing hard-wall confinement. Curvature corrections also modify the canonical thermodynamics, raising energies and slightly altering entropy and heat capacity. Our results characterize the transition from Newtonian-like orbits to strongly confined, curvature-dominated dynamics.

Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.

We investigate the rate of change of the mean atomic energy for centripetally accelerated atoms interacting with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations near a reflecting boundary, using the Dalibard-Dupont-Roc-Cohen-Tannoudji formalism. The distinct contributions from vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction are analyzed separately. Our results reveal that, when the centripetal acceleration significantly exceeds the characteristic acceleration set by the atomic transition frequency, vacuum fluctuations dominates over radiation reaction, irrespective of the atom-boundary distance and the atomic polarization. In the near-zone regime, where the atom-boundary distance is much smaller than both the characteristic length associated with the acceleration and the transition wavelength of the atom, the boundary introduces substantial corrections to the rate of change of the mean atomic energy. These corrections are comparable in magnitude to those in free space and exhibit strong dependence on the atomic polarization. Remarkably, in the intermediate and far regions, contributions stemming from the combined effects of the boundary and acceleration can become the leading and subleading terms, respectively. An acceleration-independent term also arises from their interplay. These findings highlight the significant interplay between acceleration and the presence of a boundary in shaping atomic radiative properties and may have potential implications for experimentally probing the circular Unruh effect.

We study collective excitations in a relativistic collisionless plasma composed of massless fermions subject to an external magnetic field. We include dynamical electromagnetism and fluctuations of the chiral charge, while maintaining a vanishing net chiral charge. Within the framework of chiral kinetic theory, we find that the chiral anomaly gives a correction to the dispersion relation of the transverse mode. In a strong magnetic field, we also show that the collective mode has a gap using the lowest Landau level approximation. We discuss the anomalous correction in the context of neutron star phenomenology.

We construct and analyze a novel family of exact higher-dimensional black hole solutions in Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field multiplet supporting a global monopole and a surrounding anisotropic ''scalar gas'' whose stress-energy obeys a generalized Murnaghan equation of state. By adopting the Wu-Yang magnetic ansatz for the non-Abelian sector and enforcing the physically motivated radial condition $p_r=-\rho$, the field equations admit closed-form expressions for the matter density and a single-function lapse $F(r)$ expressed in terms of elementary and Gauss hypergeometric functions. The Murnaghan fluid interpolates between a non-linear core and an effective vacuum at a large radius, producing a backreaction encoded by parameters that control the stiffness and scalar-backreaction scale. We perform a systematic survey of classical energy condition, identifying regions of parameter space where the null energy condition/dominant energy condition holds while the strong energy condition is generically violated (phantom-like behavior), and examine curvature invariants to demonstrate that the solutions possess a central curvature singularity for $n>3$. Thermodynamic properties are derived in the extended phase space: explicit formulas for the Hawking temperature, entropy, conjugate potentials, and a generalized Smarr relation are obtained; the heat capacity exhibits divergencies and sign changes that mark local stability boundaries and second-order phase transitions. Varying the Yang-Mills charge, the nonlinearity index, the monopole coupling, and the Murnaghan parameters generates a rich phase behavior structure and topology changes in the defect ($\varphi$-Duan) map. The results underscore the manner in which gauge nonlinearity, topological defects, and dual-polytropic matter collaboratively transform BH thermodynamics and the topology of phase spaces.

The extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are emerging as precision laboratories for testing the gravity beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) effect induced by the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field on the gravitational waveforms from the EMRI system. We observe that the LSB parameter $l$ appears in the leading order for the corrections of energy and angular momentum fluxes, and as $|l|$ increases, the differences in EMRI waveforms between the KR black hole and Schwarzschild black hole become more pronounced. We note that the LSB effect becomes detectable by LISA for values of $|l|\sim 10^{-6}$ with a one-year observation period. Furthermore, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approach for the parameter estimation and find the detection error for $l$ can be constrained to $\Delta l \sim 10^{-5}$ at $\mathrm{SNR} = 20$, demonstrating the potential of space-based gravitational wave detectors to rigorously test the KR field.

Exact quasinormal modes in Grumiller spacetime

Subjects:

The Grumiller metric is an effective model for gravity at large distances and plays a significant role in constructing galactic models and explaining dark matter. Here, in Grumiller spacetime, we analytically compute the quasinormal-mode frequencies and wave functions for massless particles with spin $\leq 2$ by introducing a new transformation relation. We find that the quasinormal-mode frequencies are identical for different bosons sharing the same quantum number $N$, and similarly for different fermions. However, the frequencies of bosons and fermions never coincide. Moreover, for a given spin state, the corresponding particles exhibit an $(n + 1)$-fold degeneracy. These results provide a theoretical basis for simulating particle waves with identical statistical properties.

Recent studies suggest that dark matter could take the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a possibility motivated by anomalies in galactic rotation curves and the missing mass problem in galaxy clusters. We investigate the astrophysical properties of BEC dark matter halos and their potential observational signatures distinguishing them from alternative models. In this framework, dark matter behaves as a self-gravitating Newtonian fluid with a polytropic equation of state of index $n=1$. We derive analytic expressions for the mass distribution, gravitational potential, and dynamical profiles such as the density slope and tangential velocity. The lensing behavior of BEC halos is analyzed, yielding a general series representation of the projected surface density that enables precise predictions for deflection angles, lensing potentials, and magnifications. Finally, halo equilibrium and stability are examined via the scalar and tensor virial theorems, leading to perturbation equations that describe their response to small disturbances. Together, these results provide a unified framework linking the microscopic physics of condensate dark matter to macroscopic halo observables.

The symmetry of Ising model questions any single crossover scenario for supercritical fluids. In this work, we firstly study a pair of thermodynamic crossovers $L^\pm$ analytically for the Van der Waals class fluids. We uncover an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in addition to the universal scalings in the scaling regime for this class fluids. By using the self-reciprocal property between coexistenct phases, we further establish that under suitable conditions, the Ising symmetry generally emerges in the scaling regime for a general universality class. As a consequence, the thermodynamic crossovers $L^\pm$ generally exhibit an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in the scaling regime. This partly resolves the symmetry puzzle raised by the Ising model. The results also imply that the physical importance of the Ising model in critical phenomenon is far beyond the scope of magentic transitions.

Axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model and offer a unifying perspective on open problems in cosmology. Depending on their mass and interactions, axions can act as dark matter, drive cosmic acceleration as dark energy, or contribute to the relativistic background as dark radiation. Motivated by the plenary talk at TAUP 2025, this proceeding reviews the phenomenology of light bosons in the early and late Universe, with a focus on the theoretical foundations, observational signatures, and experimental prospects.

We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 > -1$, $\omega_a < 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a < -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu < 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu < 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu < 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu < 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $< 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $< 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $> 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

Quantum mechanics predicts deviations from exponential decay at short and long times, yet experimental evidence is limited. We report a power-law tail after $\sim$10 lifetimes in erythrosine~B fluorescence, confirmed by two detectors probing distinct bands but yielding different power coefficients. The data match a divergent but normalizable spectral density, and theory predicts oscillations as a future test. A novel and general result is that in multichannel QM (and QFT) decay the lifetime is universal, but the late-time deviations exhibit a sizeable time window in which they are channel (or band) dependent, a feature consistent with our data.

The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.

Modified Einstein's equations implementing both an energy-dependent Newtonian and cosmological constant can be obtained via a modified action characterised by a non-minimal gravity-matter coupling. We show how different dynamics for the high energy regime - that nevertheless have in common the vanishing of the Newton constant - result in models of gravitational collapse which source the formation of non-singular geometries with different types of asymptotic core: de Sitter, Minkowski, and with "steep pressure". As we categorise their defining properties, one feature, which we prove to be actually independent of both the specific form of the non-minimal coupling and the equation of state of the collapsing fluid, stands out: the formation of a geometry with Minkowski core occurs only if the Newton constant, before finally vanishing, assumes negative values.

Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.

Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.

This paper attempts to construct monotonic entropy functionals for four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime under certain physical boundary conditions, as an extension of Perelman's monotonic entropy functionals constructed for three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds. The monotonicity of these entropy functionals is utilized to prove the well-posedness of applying Ricci flow to four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, particularly for the timelike modes which would seem blow up and ill-defined. The general idea is that the the Ricci flow of a Lorentzian spacetime metric and the coupled conjugate heat flow of a density on the Lorentzian spacetime as a whole turns out to be the gradient flows of the monotonic functionals under some imposed constraint, so the superficial "blow-up" in the individual Ricci flow system or the conjugate heat flow system contradicts the boundedness of the monotonic functionals within finite flow interval, which gives a global control to the whole coupled system. The physical significance and applications of these monotonic entropy functionals in real gravitational systems are also discussed.

Momentum correlation in pair production by spacetime dependent fields from scattered wave functions

We consider Sauter-Schwinger pair production by electric fields that depend on both time and space, $E(t,z)$ and $E(t,x,y)$. For space-independent fields, $E(t)$, momentum conservation, $\delta({\bf p}+{\bf p}')$, fixes the positron momentum, ${\bf p}'$, in terms of the electron momentum, ${\bf p}$. For $E(t,z)$, on the other hand, $p_z$ and $p'_z$ are independent. However, previous exact-numerical studies have considered only the probability as a function of a single momentum variable, $P(p_z)$, $P(p'_z)$ or $P(p'_z-p_z)$, but not the correlation $P(p_z,p'_z)$. In this paper, we show how to obtain $P(p_z,p'_z)$ by solving the Dirac equation numerically. To do so, we split the wave function into a background and a scattered wave, $\psi(t,{\bf x})=\psi_{\rm back.}(t,{\bf x})+\psi_{\rm scat.}(t,{\bf x})$, where $\psi_{\rm back.}\propto\exp(\pm ipx+\text{gauge term})$. $\psi_{\rm scat.}$ vanishes outside a past light cone and is obtained by solving $(i\mathcal{D}-m)\psi_{\rm scat.}=-(i\mathcal{D}-m)\psi_{\rm back}$ backwards in time starting with $\psi_{\rm scat.}(t\to+\infty,{\bf x})=0$.

This paper investigates a new black hole solution within the framework of bumblebee gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections parameterized by $\Theta$ and implemented through the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$. Notably, the event horizon remains unaffected by $\Theta$, while the surface gravity becomes ill-defined, in agreement with the behavior previously reported for the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole [1]. The propagation of light is examined by analyzing null geodesics, identifying critical orbits, and determining the resulting black hole shadow. To complement these analyses, we explore gravitational lensing by evaluating the deflection angle in both the weak- and strong-field regimes. Using these results, constraints are derived for the lensing observables by comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, we close the analysis by deriving additional constraints from standard Solar System experiments, including Mercury's orbital precession, gravitational light bending, and time-delay measurements.

It is well known that soft singularities of massless amplitudes are significantly simpler than those of massive ones. However, the computation of the soft anomalous dimension (AD) using Wilson-lines correctors is only straightforward in the massive case, thanks to the multiplicative renormalizability of correlators of non-lightlike Wilson lines. Instead, correlators involving lightlike lines, develop higher-order poles in dimensional regularization due to collinear singularities, on top of their ultraviolet divergences. We nevertheless show, using the method of regions, how correlators involving lightlike lines can be interpreted and used in the computation of the multileg soft AD. As a case study, we compute the two-loop soft AD for two massive and one massless particles. To this end, we start with the correlator of three timelike Wilson lines and apply the method of regions in the limit where one of the lines becomes lightlike. A correlator involving a strictly lightlike line then emerges as the "hard region" in this expansion. Its collinear divergences are removed upon adding the remaining regions, recovering the correct ultraviolet pole corresponding to the sought-after AD. By applying the method of regions, we are able to disentangle between ultraviolet and infrared divergences appearing in the strict limit. We also discover new phenomena, such as hard-virtuality collinear modes whose presence reflects the rescaling symmetry of semi-infinite Wilson lines. Our approach generalizes to any combination of massive and massless particles at higher loop order.

We review results on small-data global stability and highlight their applicability to classical interacting scalar fields with opposite-sign kinetic terms (ghosts). Further, we present a one-parameter family of numerical scattering solutions under the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. We thereby identify classical ghostly field theories with polynomial interaction potentials for which small-data global stability apparently extends to large-data global stability, i.e., global stability for all compactly supported initial data. These global stability results support an underlying physical mechanism by which the ghost instability can be quenched due to dominant self-interactions, at least in classical physics.

$E_2L_\infty$-algebras, Generalized Geometry, and Tensor Hierarchies

We define a generalized form of $L_\infty$-algebras called $E_2L_\infty$-algebras. As we show, these provide the natural algebraic framework for generalized geometry and the symmetries of double field theory as well as the gauge algebras arising in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. Our perspective shows that the kinematical data of the tensor hierarchy is an adjusted higher gauge theory, which is important for developing finite gauge transformations as well as non-local descriptions. Mathematically, $E_2L_\infty$-algebras shed some light on Loday's problem of integrating Leibniz algebras.

We study a class of SYK models with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, described by $N$ fermions in chiral Fermi multiplets, as well as $\alpha N$ first-order bosons in chiral multiplets. The interactions are characterized by two integers $(p,q)$. We focus on the large $N$ and low energy limit of these models. Despite the presence of dynamical bosons, we find conformal behavior akin to the standard SYK model. We use $\mathcal{I}$-extremization of a Witten index to study the supersymmetric solutions. In particular, we find an exact expression for the entropy, which matches the numerical solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We further solve the model both in the large $p$ and large $p,q$ limits. Numerically, we verify our analytical results and obtain estimates for the Schwarzian coupling in the near zero-temperature limit. We also study the low-lying spectrum of operators to determine the parameter ranges where the Schwarzian mode dominates the IR dynamics. Lastly, we study out-of-time-ordered correlators to show that the model is maximally chaotic.

Quantum informatic quantities such as entanglement entropy are useful in detecting quantum phase transitions. Recently, a new entanglement measure called pseudo-entropy was proposed which is a generalization of the more well-known entanglement entropy. It has many nice properties and is useful in the study of post-selection measurements. In this paper, one of our goals is to explore the properties of pseudo-entropy and study its effectiveness as a quantum chaos diagnostic, i.e., as a tool to distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. Using various variants of the SYK model, we study the signal of quantum chaos captured in the pseudo-entropy and relate it to the spectral form factor (SFF) and local operator entanglement (LOE).

We compute the potential-graviton contribution to the scattering amplitude, the radial action, and the scattering angle of two extremal black holes in N = 8 supergravity at the fifth post-Minkowskian order to next-to-leading order in a large mass expansion (first self-force order). Properties of classical unitarity cuts allow us to focus on the integration-by-parts reduction of planar integrals, while nonplanar integrals at this order are obtained from the planar ones by straightforward manipulations. We present all master integrals and solve their associated differential equations necessary to evaluate the classical scattering amplitudes of massive scalar particles at this order in all gravitational theories, in particular in N = 8 supergravity, and in general relativity. Despite the appearance of higher-weight generalized polylogarithms and elliptic functions in the solution to the differential equation for master integrals, the final supergravity answer is remarkably simple and contains only (harmonic) polylogarithmic functions up to weight 2. The systematic analysis of elliptic integrals discussed here, as well as the particular organization of boundary integrals in N = 8 observables are independent of supersymmetry and may have wider applications, including to aspects of collider physics.

Twisted holography captures protected aspects of well-known holographic dualities. We show how the holographic dual B-model background can be systematically derived from the 't Hooft expansion of the chiral algebras associated to four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories. A crucial tool is the match of planar BRST anomalies in the field theory and on the worldsheet, especially in the presence of probe D-branes. Our construction is very general and can be applied to chiral algebras which do not have a four-dimensional origin. The resulting holographic dual backgrounds are typically non-geometric and appear to be novel. We expect our strategy to have a wide range of applications to other examples of twisted holography and, potentially, weak coupling holography.

The Ryu-Takayanagi formula predicts that two boundary subsystems $A$ and $C$ can exhibit large mutual information $I(A:C)$ even when they are spatially disconnected on the boundary and separated by a buffer subsystem $B$, as long as $A$ and $C$ have connected entanglement wedge in the bulk. However, whether the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ contains distillable EPR pairs has remained a longstanding open problem. In this work, we resolve this problem by showing that: i) there is no LO-distillable entanglement at leading order in $G_N$, suggesting the absence of bipartite entanglement in a holographic mixed state $\rho_{AC}$, and ii) one-shot, one-way LOCC-distillable entanglement is given at leading order by locally accessible information $J^W(A|C)$, which is related to the entanglement wedge cross section $E^W$ involving the (third) purifying system $B$ via $J^W(A|C) = S_A - E^W(A:B)$. Namely, we demonstrate that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply nonzero distillable entanglement in one-shot, one-way LOCC. We also show that entanglement of formation $E_{F}(A:C)$ is given by $E^W(A:C)$ at leading order in holography.

The universality of gravitational scattering at low energies and large distances encoded in soft theorems and memory effects can be understood from symmetries. In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite enhancement of translations, extending the PoincarÃ© group to the BMS group, is the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the gravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared triangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the soft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the classical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an `infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions is accounted for. Building on earlier results in 2403.13053 where we derived a novel conservation law associated to the infinite dimensional enhancement of Lorentz transformations to superrotations, we prove here its validity to all orders in the gravitational coupling and show that it implies the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Saha-Sahoo-Sen in 1912.06413. We furthermore extend the formula for the displacement memory and its tail from particles to fields, thus completing the classical superrotation infrared triangle.

The universality of the logarithmic soft photon theorem in four dimensions can be traced to an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts as a local phase rotation on matter as we have shown in 2403.13053. Here we extend our earlier results for the charges associated to these superphaserotations to all orders in the coupling and prove that their conservation is exactly the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem discovered by Saha, Sahoo and Sen in 1912.06413. We furthermore generalize the formulae for the associated electromagnetic displacement memory and its tail from particles to scalar matter fields. This completes the classical superphaserotation infrared triangle.

Recently, it was shown that in the absence of gravity there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons. In this paper, focusing on the false-vacuum decay in a single scalar field in flat Euclidean space, we provide a general discussion on $O(4)$-symmetric instantons that are singular at the true-vacuum bubble. We find that, for the action to remain finite without introducing a UV cutoff, the potential must be unbounded from below, thereby evading Coleman's theorem. We then consider two explicit examples of such instantons and perturbatively analyze the dynamics of small deformations around them. We find that one of them does not allow regular deformations, which indicates that the $O(4)$ symmetric solution still gives the minimum action, while the other one is found to allow regular deformations that cost no additional action at second order in perturbation. The latter example opens up the possibility of the existence of non-linear non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with lower action if we allow singular instantons with finite action.

We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative quantum field theory, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.

We investigate the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the photon-fermion one-particle irreducible vertex in QED in linear covariant gauges. The longitudinal component of this vertex is described using the Ball-Chiu basis, while its transverse part is expressed with the KÄ±zÄ±lersu-Reenders-Pennington basis. Combining the vertex Ward-Takahashi identity with the vertex equation, we derive a set of exact, non-linear integral equations governing the transverse vertex. These equations hold for any linear covariant gauge and must be solved self-consistently. We discuss several approximations to the exact equations, generalizing results previously obtained at the perturbative one-loop level. Various kinematical configurations are also examined. Furthermore, we compute the perturbative solution of the transverse vertex Dyson-Schwinger equations for all transverse form factors and derive their perturbative asymptotic expressions.

In type II Calabi-Yau string compactifications, S-duality predicts that suitable generating series of BPS indices counting micro-states of D4-D2-D0 black holes are in general mock modular forms of higher depth. The non-holomorphic contributions needed to cancel the anomaly under modular transformations involve certain indefinite theta series with kernels constructed from generalized error functions. Physically, these contributions are expected to arise from a spectral asymmetry in the continuum of scattering states of $n$ BPS dyons with mutually non-local charges. For $n=2$, the (standard, depth one) error function completion was derived long ago by explicitly computing the bosonic and fermionic density of states in the two-body supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Here we derive the general non-holomorphic completion for an arbitrary number of centers by evaluating the refined Witten index of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics using localisation. In a nutshell, the index reduces to an integral over $\mathbb{R}^{3n-3}$ (the relative location of the centers), and splits into an integral over the $2n-2$ dimensional phase space of BPS ground states times an integral over $n-1$ transverse directions, which ultimately produces the expected generalized error functions.

The gauge invariant minimal couplings for a class of relativistic free matter fields with global symmetry (related to usual charge conservation) have been obtained by incorporating an iterative Noether mechanism. Non-relativistic reduction of both matter and gauge sectors of the obtained interacting theory is then performed simultaneously which in turn yield a set of new effective actions which are invariant under the Galilean relativistic framework. To be precise, we show that one can obtain the SchrÃ¶dinger field theory coupled to Galilean electromagnetism from the scalar quantum electrodynamics theory. Higher derivative corrections have also been included for which the non-relativistic reductions have been consistently carried out once again. On the other hand, the action for quantum electrodynamics leads to the Galilean Pauli-SchrÃ¶dinger theory where the gauge field is non-relativistic or Galilean. Further, some novel relations are found (in both the electric and magnetic limits) between various components appearing in the Galilean avatar of electrodynamics.

Scale without conformal symmetry corresponds to an inhomogeneous conservation equation for the virial current sourced by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Fluids that are just scale-invariant differ qualitatively from their conformal counterparts, and generic dissipation effects relax the hydrodynamic response over sufficiently long time scales. Remarkably, this holds true already at the ideal order. Spontaneously broken scale symmetry does not, in general, add any new mode to the hydrodynamic sector.

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
Holographic thermal two-point functions can be analyzed using the operator product expansion which contains contributions from both multi-stress-tensor and double-trace operators. The former can be computed by analyzing the bulk equation of motion in a near-boundary expansion, but the latter has remained elusive-in practice, one resorts to solving a partial differential equation with limited accuracy. We show that imposing the Euclidean periodicity condition on the holographic correlator (also known as the KMS condition or thermal bootstrap), followed by PadÃ©-Borel resummation, provides an efficient method for computing double-trace thermal coefficients. The resulting series converges rapidly and yields numerical values in excellent agreement with those obtained from solving the partial differential equation.

We show that the infrared phases of certain line defects in 2+1d quantum field theories are determined by anomalies, including anomalies in the space of defect coupling constants, together with a symmetry-refined corollary of the $g$-theorem. As an example, we prove that the spin-$1/2$ impurities in the 2+1d critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models (known respectively as the Halon and Boson-Kondo defects) flow to non-trivial conformal line operators in the IR, and we supply evidence that the same extends to all spin $s$. We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.

In this paper, we study a new class of AdS/BCFT setups, where the world-volumes of end-of-the-world branes (EOW branes) are given by flat spaces, to explore flat space holography from an AdS bulk. We show that they provide gravity duals of CFTs in the presence of null boundaries. Our holographic calculations lead to many new predictions on entanglement entropy, correlation functions and partition functions for CFTs with null boundaries. By considering a bulk region between two EOW branes, we present an AdS/BCFT explanation that the flat space gravity is dual to a Carrollian CFT (CCFT), including the swing surface calculation of entanglement entropy.

We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model Ã  la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays PoincarÃ© duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.

We apply the method of regions to the evaluation of dual conformal integrals with small off-shellness. In contrast to conventional approach, where the separation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization breaking the dual conformal invariance (DCI), we use a sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and analytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization (dubbed as DCI regularization), the contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method dramatically simplifies the calculations. As a demonstration, we calculate the slightly off-shell DCI pentabox integral up to power corrections. The contributions of all 32 regions appear to be expressible in terms of products/ratios of $\Gamma$-functions multiplied by some powers of DCI cross-ratios. Therefore, after removing the regularization, we obtain the final expression in terms of cross-ratios logarithms only. We have checked that our result for pentabox integral numerically agrees with the result of the recent Belitsky\&Smirnov paper [arXiv:2508.14298] which has essentially more complicated form.

We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in SchrÃ¶dinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials, the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However, as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs -- Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile, transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of $2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered -- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.

We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.

The Unruh effect predicts that a uniformly accelerated observer perceives the vacuum seen by an inertial observer as a thermal bath at a temperature proportional to its proper acceleration. This phenomenon is often regarded as a flat spacetime ``cousin" of Hawking radiation. In this Letter, we first study the entanglement dynamics of a quantum system composed of two polarizable two-level subsystems undergoing centripetal acceleration in a vacuum. We demonstrate that the system's steady state can be entangled irrespective of the initial state, a distinct characteristic attributable to the circular manifestation of the Unruh effect. Through meticulous analysis, we then propose that this phenomenon can feasibly be detected using state-of-the-art optomechanical technologies, particularly with a quantum system of two molecules.

We conclude that the phase transition of an NS is a plausible mechanism to power the SGRs as well as the repeating FRBs.

In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium including its transport properties are most likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the specific heat at constant pressure, the specific heat at constant volume, the trace anomaly, the thermal diffusion constant and the isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the emergence of angular velocity enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and the thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperatures than at low temperatures. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.

Non-trivial fixed point of a $Ï^4_d$ fermionic theory, II. Anomalous exponent and scaling operators

We consider the Renormalization Group (RG) fixed-point theory associated with a fermionic $\psi^4_d$ model in $d=1,2,3$ with fractional kinetic term, whose scaling dimension is fixed so that the quartic interaction is weakly relevant in the RG sense. The model is defined in terms of a Grassmann functional integral with interaction $V^*$, solving a fixed-point RG equation in the presence of external fields, and a fixed ultraviolet cutoff. We define and construct the field and density scale-invariant response functions, and prove that the critical exponent of the former is the naive one, while that of the latter is anomalous and analytic. We construct the corresponding (almost-)scaling operators, whose two point correlations are scale-invariant up to a remainder term, which decays like a stretched exponential at distances larger than the inverse of the ultraviolet cutoff. Our proof is based on constructive RG methods and, specifically, on a convergent tree expansion for the generating function of correlations, which generalizes the approach developed by three of the authors in a previous publication [A. Giuliani, V. Mastropietro, S. Rychkov, JHEP 01 (2021) 026].

In this work, we analyze the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory of gravity in a cosmological context using the formalism of dynamical systems. We obtain the equations of motion of the theory and introduce an appropriate set of dynamical variables to allow for a direct comparison with the results from General Relativity (GR). We observe that the cosmological phase space features the same set of fixed points as in standard GR, i.e., radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, curvature-dominated, and exponentially-accelerated solutions independently of the values of the coupling function and the scalar field. Furthermore, the radiation-dominated fixed points are repellers and the exponentially accelerated fixed points are attractors in the phase space, thus allowing for cosmological solutions behaving qualitatively similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., transitioning from a radiation-dominated phase into a matter-dominated phase, and later into a late-time cosmic acceleration phase supported by the scalar field potential. Following a reconstruction method through which we produce the cosmological solutions in the GR limit of the theory and introduce them into the general EsGB dynamical system, a numerical integration of the dynamical system shows that the EsGB theory provides cosmological solutions indistinguishable from those of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, while maintaining the scalar field and the coupling function finite and regular throughout the entire time evolution.

Thermodynamics of local causal horizons have been shown to encode the information necessary to derive the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We have previously shown that, in the presence of matter, this derivation further implies quantum phenomenological corrections to gravitational dynamics. Herein, we study whether similar corrections also occur in vacuum. We show that, under the assumptions of locality and local Lorentz invariance of physics, the vacuum dynamics is prescribed by the Einstein equations. We also discuss an alternative paradigm which assumes the existence of a preferred direction of time (much like in Einstein-aether or HoÅava-Lifshitz gravity). Then, we find an modified gravitational dynamics in which Ricci curvature is sourced by Bel-Robinson super-energy.

The question of what is the total entropy of the universe, how it compares to the maximal entropy of de Sitter space, and how it is distributed across the universe's components, bears considerable importance for a number of reasons. Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.

Gauge Covariant Link Formulation of Twisted N=D=4 and N=4 D=5 Super Yang-Mills on a Lattice

We propose a lattice formulation of four dimensional super Yang-Mills model with a twisted N=4 supersymmetry in a manifestly gauge covariant manner. The formulation we employ here is a four dimensional extension of the manifestly gauge covariant method which was developed in our proposals of Dirac-Kahler twisted N=D=2 and N=4 D=3 super Yang-Mills on a lattice. Twisted N=4 supersymmetry algebra is geometrically realized on a four dimensional lattice with link supercharges and the use of link (anti-)commutators. Employing Grassmann parameters with link nature, we explicitly show that the resulting super Yang-Mills action is invariant under all the supercharges on a lattice without chiral fermion problems. As a group and algebraic interpretation of the link approach, we show that promoting bosonic supercovariant derivatives to their exponentials consistently with the lattice Leibniz rule naturally gives rise to the notion of gauge covariant link (anti-)commutators. This can be regarded as a fermionic decomposition of a Lie group element, which may provide a new methodology in super Lie group and super Lie algebra. We also provide a five dimensional lift-up of the formulation with exact N=4 SUSY invariance on a five dimensional lattice.

There exist two consistent theories of massless, self-interacting gravitons, which differ by their local symmetries: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. We show that these two theories are also the only two metric descriptions of gravity in 4 spacetime dimensions which obey the equivalence principle for test gravitational physics. We further analyse how the weaker formulations of the equivalence principle are realised in Weyl transverse gravity (and its generalisations). The analysis sheds light on the behaviour of matter fields in this theory.

We present the first exact and analytical solution in General Relativity describing an equilibrium configuration for two stationary black holes. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed in an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta and the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.

We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.

Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics

Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.

Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We provide understanding of our numerical and analytical large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.

The equivalence principle for test gravitational physics strongly constrains dynamics of spacetime, providing a powerful criterion for selecting candidate theories of gravity. However, checking its validity for a particular theory is often a very difficult task. We devise here a simple theoretical criterion for identifying equivalence principle violations in black hole thermodynamics. Employing this criterion, we prove that Lanczos-Lovelock gravity violates the strong equivalence principle, leaving general relativity as the only local, diffeomorphism-invariant theory compatible with it. However, we also show that certain nonlocal expressions for black hole entropy appear to obey the strong equivalence principle.

Electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe) have emerged as a compelling formation channel for low-mass neutron stars, bolstered by decades of theoretical work and increasingly supported by observational evidence, including the recent identification of SN~2018zd. Motivated by this, we investigate the influence of fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) on the equilibrium structure of progenitor cores and the formation of their neutron star remnants. Using a general relativistic two-fluid formalism, we model the coupled evolution of ordinary matter (OM) and ADM, treated as separately conserved fluids interacting solely through gravity. Our analysis focuses on neon-rich white dwarfs (Ne WDs), which are typical progenitor cores for ECSNe. We assume conservation of both baryon number ($N_B$) and dark matter particle number ($N_D$) during collapse, allowing for a consistent mapping between progenitor and remnant configurations. We find that ADM significantly enhances the central density of the WD progenitor. This lowers the threshold gravitational mass $M^*$ required to initiate electron capture, enabling ECSNe from lower-mass progenitors. The resulting remnants are stable, dark matter-admixed neutron stars with gravitational masses potentially well below current observational bounds. Moreover, we find that the conversion energy during the WD-to-NS conversion is also significantly reduced for higher ADM particle masses and fractions, suggesting that unusually low-energy ECSNe may serve as potential indicators of ADM involvement in stellar collapse.

We study the entanglement indices such as logarithmic negativities (LNs) and mutual informations (MIs) between two adjacent subsets in a isolated universal set $U$ of harmonic oscillators arranged on a two dimensional lattice within a sufficiently large square. First, we verify the values of the corner functions of angle $\pi/2, \pi/4, 3\pi/4$ presented in the previous study which adopts periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the $U$. The values of each corner function obtained from LNs are nearly equal to those in the previous ones, while those of $3\pi/4$ from MIs are not sufficiently consistent with those computed from LNs. Next, for the case where the universal system $U$ satisfies the fixed end boundary conditions(FBCs), we calculate LNs, MIs at several locations in $U$, compare them, especially corner functions with the values obtained in the PBCs case, and examine the effect of the fixed ends. In addition, we examine Renyi entropies for sets of three dimensional lattice sites, the corner functions and the edge terms with solid angles and dihedral angles $\pi/2,\pi/4$, respectively.

In this work we examine a theoretical scenario which combines two fundamental theoretical proposals for the early Universe and a possible evolution for the early post-inflationary epoch. Specifically, we assume that the early Universe contains gravity's rainbow effects on the spacetime and the inflationary Lagrangian contains $R^2$ corrections or $f(R)$ gravity corrections in general. In addition we assume that the era beyond the end of inflation until the reheating temperature is reached, is a kination era. Both theories, $R^2$ and gravity's rainbow emerge from a quantum context so their effects should be first checked at the theory which connects the quantum with the classical, hence inflation. Spacetime is four dimensional and the effects of the quantum theory could possibly be imprinted in the inflationary Lagrangian and of course on the spacetime itself. For the gravity's rainbow deformed Starobinsky model, both Lagrangian quantum effects and spacetime quantum effects are combined. As we show the resulting theory is compatible with the ACT data. We also consider power-law $f(R)$ gravity deformations and we show that in this case, the model is viable without the need of extending the slow-roll era of inflation.

We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.

In this work we aim to provide a new parametrization of power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation framework in the Jordan frame. It is known in the literature that the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation of the form $F(R)=R+\beta R^n$ is non-viable and produces a power-law evolution. We demonstrate that the standard approach in power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation has some parametrization issues that may lead to inconsistencies and we introduce a new parametrization which elevates the role of power-law $F(R)$ gravity deformations of the Starobinsky inflation, making it viable and compatible with both the Planck and ACT data. In our approach the power-law $F(R)$ gravity inflation is disentangled from a power-law evolution.

This work digs into the connection between gravity and thermodynamics of stretched light cones (SLC). They are associated with uniformly accelerating observers, who endow the SLC with a physical notion of temperature via the Unruh effect. We compute the expansion, shear, and vorticity of the SLC to fully study its dynamics and account for the possibility of previously predicted non-equilibrium entropy production. For consistency, we prove the equivalence of the two different geometrical methods available for studying the SLCs' properties. Then, we apply the energy balance and use Clausius' relation to relate the geometrical properties of the SLC with energy fluxes crossing its surface, showing that it encodes the equations governing the gravitational dynamics. We show here how this analysis can be fully carried in terms of equilibrium thermodynamics due to the vanishing of shear, and how one can identify a work term related to the acceleration of the observer.

We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with PadÃ© resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.
