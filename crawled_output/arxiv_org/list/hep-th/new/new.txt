Title:
Living on the edge: a non-perturbative resolution to the negativity of bulk entropies

Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg, and Shan (LMRS) presented a new information paradox in black hole physics by noticing that the entanglement and Rényi entropies in a two-sided black hole can become negative when the geometry contains a very large number of matter excitations behind the black hole horizon. While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and Rényi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using random tensor network techniques.

Title:
Higher-form symmetries as higher automorphism bundles
Alonso Perez-Lona
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Category Theory (math.CT)
The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.

A generalization of the coadjoint orbit action describes the dynamics of an observer (or instrument). We consider how this fits in with the view of observables in field theory being correlations of read-outs of instruments and show how one recovers the usual $S$-matrix formulae. A simple resolution of the Fermi paradox is also pointed out.

Topological invariant for holographic Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetal

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The presence of a topological phase in a topological many-body system can be distinguished through the analysis of topological invariants. In the present study, the topological invariants for the strongly coupled holographic semimetals have been systematically computed, especially focusing on the holographic Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetal. The topological invariants that we calculate include the Weyl charge, the topological charges for a nodal ring $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$ and an additional mirror symmetry protected topological invariant, $\widetilde{\zeta}_{2}$, that we herein introduce. In addition, the effective band structures and topological invariants in the critical phases of holographic semimetals are investigated, including the case of Weyl, nodal line and Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetals. The findings indicate the presence of notable and unique features inherent to strongly coupled topological semimetals, including band-crossing ordering interchange and multi Fermi surfaces, which provide a valuable platform for experimental investigations of strongly coupled semimetals in condensed matter physics.

Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory

Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.

New recursion relations for M2-brane matrix models
Bin He, Tomoki Nosaka
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
In this paper we investigate the finite $N$ exact values of the $S^3$ partition function of the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with one adjoint hypermultiplet and $N_\text{f}$ fundamental hypermultiplets, which describes $N$ M2-branes on $\mathbb{C}^2\times \mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{N_\text{f}}$, with mass and FI deformations. We claim that the grand canonical sum of the partition function obeys a bilinear difference relation with respect to the shifts of the mass parameters of the fundamental hypermultiplets, which results in a new recursion relation for the partition function with respect to $N$. As an application, we also determine the analytic expression for the leading $1/N$ non-perturbative correction to the free energy of these models, which would correspond holographically to the contribution from an M2-brane wrapped on a 3d volume in the internal space of $\text{AdS}_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{N_\text{f}}$.

Viewed through the lens of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we demonstrate that higher-form currents with nonzero ghost number also define higher-form symmetries, directly analogous to the standard higher-form symmetries with ghost number zero. These ghostly higher symmetries descend from and into conventional higher-form symmetries via chains of descent equations familiar from the theory of anomalies and topological field theories. We give examples of such chains of ghostly symmetries in Maxwell theory, Abelian and non-Abelian higher gauge theory, Yang-Mills theory, and beyond.

Eigenvalue distribution from bootstrap estimates

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The bootstrap method has proven useful for a wide range of matrix models. Here, we show that the computed momenta can be used to reconstruct the underlying eigenvalue probability distribution, which in turn allows us to compute the free energy of the model, a necessary quantity for identifying the thermodynamically preferred solution. We verify the method on the well-studied quartic potential model and then apply it to a recently analysed asymmetric multi-trace model. We consider an extended class of possible solutions and demonstrate that free-energy analysis reliably selects the correct one, making it an essential tool for studying models with a complex solution structure.

Sampling String Vacua Using Generative Models
Moritz Walden, Magdalena Larfors
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We apply generative models to a key problem in the string compactification program, namely construction of type IIB string vacua. To this end, we make use of a Bayesian Flow Network, a generative model capable of handling discrete data, to generate flux vectors that give rise to type IIB vacua. Furthermore, we sample flux vacua that have certain desirable properties by employing a Transformer as a conditional generative model. Both models demonstrate good performance in finding flux vacua and thus prove to be powerful tools in the exploration of the string landscape.

$η_{\rm w}$-meson from topological properties of the electroweak vacuum

We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous $B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the $B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.

Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.

Symmetry extension by condensation defects in five-dimensional gauge theories

Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We investigate the symmetry structure of five-dimensional Yang-Mills theories with $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ gauge algebra. These theories feature intertwined 0-, 1-, and 2-form symmetries, depending on the global variant one is considering. In the $SU(N)$ theory, there is a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the instantonic 0-form symmetry and the electric 1-form symmetry. We show that in the $PSU(N)$ theory this translates into a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ extension of the instantonic symmetry, generated by an invertible condensation defect of the magnetic 2-form symmetry. We identify the charged configurations as linked 't Hooft surfaces, while pointlike instanton operators remain insensitive to the extension. We generalize our analysis to the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_k$ global form and show that similar results hold, embedded now in a 3-group structure for generic $k$. We then apply our findings to $SO(3)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We determine the global form of the enhanced instantonic symmetry of its superconformal UV completion, showing that it arises through a similar symmetry extension mechanism from the parent $E_1$ theory, which is the UV completion of $SU(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Finally, we recast our results in the language of the symmetry topological field theory. As a warm-up, we also analyze Maxwell theory, highlighting analogous features involving continuous symmetries and composite currents.

Quantum Properties of Non-Dirichlet Boundary Conditions in Gravity

The Euclidean path integral for gravity is enriched by the addition of boundaries, which provide useful probes of thermodynamic properties. Common boundary conditions include Dirichlet conditions on the boundary induced metric; microcanonical conditions, which refers to fixing some components of the Brown-York boundary stress tensor; and conformal conditions, in which the conformal structure of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Boundaries also present interesting problems of consistency. The Dirichlet problem is known, under various (and generally different) conditions, to be inconsistent with perturbative quantization of graviton fluctuations; to exhibit thermodynamic instability; or to require infinite fine-tuning in the presence of matter fluctuations. We extend some of these results to other boundary conditions. We find that similarly to the Dirichlet problem, the graviton fluctuation operator is not elliptic with microcanonical boundaries, and the non-elliptic modes correspond to ``boundary-moving diffeomorphisms." However, we argue that microcanonical factorization of path integrals -- essentially, the insertion of microcanonical constraints on two-sided surfaces in the bulk -- is not affected by the same issues of ellipticity. We also show that for a variety of matter field boundary conditions, matter fluctuations renormalize the gravitational bulk and boundary terms differently, so that the classical microcanonical or conformal variational problems are not preserved unless an infinite fine-tuning is performed.

Title:
Classical Mechanics on Finite Spaces
Kaustav Giri, V. V. Sreedhar
Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The connection between topology and quantum mechanics is one of the cornerstones of modern physics. Several examples of current interest like the Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum mechanics, monopoles and instantons in quantum field theory, the quantum Hall effect in condensed matter physics, anyons in topological quantum computation, and the AdS-CFT correspondence in string theory illustrate this connection.
Since classical mechanics is a limiting case of quantum mechanics, it behooves us to ask how topology impacts classical mechanics. Topological considerations do play an important role in the classical context too, for example in fluid vortices and atmospheric dynamics.
With a desire to understand this connection more deeply, we study classical mechanics on finite spaces. Towards this end, we use the formalism developed by Bering and identify the corrections to the Klein-Gordon equation due to the presence of the boundary. We solve the modified equation in various dimensions under suitable assumptions of symmetry.

General form of $f(R)$ and $(2+1)$-dimensional charge/non-charge black hole solutions

We introduce novel black hole (BH) solutions, charge/non-charge, within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that does not inherently include a cosmological constant, using equal/diffirent metric ansatzs. Remarkably, these solutions exhibit asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) or de Sitter (dS) behavior, depending on their parameter values. Unlike the BTZ solutions of General Relativity, which feature a causal singularity and constant scalar invariants, our solutions display strong spacetime singularities, as shown by their scalar invariants. We construct $f(R)$ functions that behave as polynomial functions, emphasizing the unique nature of these solutions. We demonstrate the stability of these solutions in two ways: first, by showing that their heat capacity is positive, which ensures thermodynamic stability; and second, by proving that the second derivative of $f(R)$ is positive, meeting the Ostrogradski criterion for dynamical stability. Furthermore, the solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, confirming their consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles.

Analytic two-loop amplitudes for di-jet and $γ+$jet production mediated by a heavy-quark loop

In this paper, we present analytical results for the two-loop QCD corrections to the production of two partons or a photon and a parton in hadronic collisions, mediated by loops of massive quarks. These amplitudes involve Feynman integrals defined on an elliptic curve. We compute them by generalizing our recent results for the production of two photons to include additional crossings of the corresponding master integrals, which we compute in terms of the same basis of independent iterated integrals. We discuss the analytical properties of the amplitudes, highlighting the cancellations of a large number of elliptic differential forms in their finite remainders. Finally, we elaborate on a strategy for their numerical evaluation based on generalized series expansions at singular points of the physical amplitude, through the introduction of suitable sets of variables that allow us to resolve all singularities.

Singularity and differentiability at the origin of regular black holes
Tommaso Antonelli, Marco Sebastianutti
Comments:

Subjects:

The divergence of curvature invariants at a given point signals the incompleteness of the spacetime, and the derivative order of these diverging invariants determines the differentiability class of the considered spacetime. We hereby focus on a general static and spherically symmetric geometry and determine, in the full non-linear regime and in a model independent way, the conditions that the metric functions must satisfy in order to achieve regularity at the origin. This work is structured around a central theorem, which relates the regularity of the spacetime at the origin to the parity of the metric functions. The detailed proof of this theorem constitutes the main result of the paper.

Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter, $0<|\varepsilon|<1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic} reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$ gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)<0$). All the above physically interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit reconstruction approach.

The Weyl Geometric Gravity black hole in light of the Solar System tests

The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the Eötvös parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.

We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.

For more than half a century, dualities have been at the heart of modern physics. From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.

We investigate the conditions necessary for the existence of a rotating traversable wormhole by introducing a Casimir source and an external electric field. A viable wormhole solution emerges when the rotation is constant, corresponding to that of an observer in a zero angular momentum frame. Furthermore, a radially dependent rotation is also a feasible solution, provided the angular velocity decreases exponentially as one moves away from the throat.

The presence of a topological susceptibility in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model implies the existence of a pseudoscalar state in the spectrum, $\eta_W$. We show that, within the Standard Model, no new particle is required to form this state.

We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with Padé resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.

We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.

Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moiré flatbands are known to host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators). In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $, coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after constructing a minimal effective action.

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We investigate thermodynamics of a non-interacting quantum field in a static black hole background. The horizon divergences are regulated by the brick wall method, which consists of subjecting the quantum field to Dirichlet boundary conditions on a surface (the brick wall) just outside the horizon. Using heat kernel and Mellin transform methods, we derive high-temperature expansions for the free energy and entropy and study the boundary and higher-order geometric effects on the horizon divergences induced by the brick wall. We consider real scalar, complex scalar, and Dirac fields in Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström and dilatonic black hole backgrounds, as well as in their near-horizon geometries. By evaluating the high-temperature expansion of the entropy (up to a certain order) at the Hawking temperature, we show that, for a given field type, the leading horizon divergence is the same for all the metrics considered. Moreover, we show that the different orders in the high-temperature expansion become comparable at the Hawking temperature and compare our findings with existing results in the literature. We derive an explicit formula for the sub-leading horizon divergence expressed in terms of the field mass, surface gravity, horizon area, and dilaton parameter, which is applicable to all the exact metrics considered. We also consider the possibility of using Neumann boundary conditions to regularize the horizon divergences.

Gauged compact Q-balls and Q-shells in a multi-component $CP^N$ model

We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains Q-balls/shells, which are non-topological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, Q-shells can shelter another compact Q-ball or Q-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multi-compacton formations is affected by electric charge. We are interested in structures with non-zero or zero total net charge.

D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks

We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.

Holographic derivation of effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid

Using a holographic prescription for the Schwinger-Keldysh closed time path, we derive the effective action for a dissipative neutral fluid holographically described by the Einstein gravity in an asymptotic AdS spacetime. In the saddle point approximation for the dual gravity, the goal is achieved by solving the double Dirichlet problem for the linearized gravitational field living in a complexified static AdS black brane background. We adopt a partially on-shell scheme for solving the bulk dynamics, which is equivalent to ``integrating out'' the gapped modes in the boundary field theory. The boundary effective action in the fluid spacetime, identified as the partially on-shell bulk action, is computed to first order in boundary derivative and to cubic order in AdS boundary data. The boundary effective action, rewritten in the physical spacetime, successfully reproduces various results known in the framework of classical hydrodynamics, confirming our holographic derivation.

A Celestial Kinematical Interpretation for an Extended BMS$_4$
Carles Batlle, Roberto Casalbuoni, Daniele Dominici, José Figueroa-O'Farrill, Joaquim Gomis

Enlarged version. Two new sections about the scalar field realization in the boost basis, using the Mellin transform, and the relation to the Longhi-Materassi construction in terms of spherical harmonics have been added, as well as a short discussion about the massive case and a new appendix.

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
Motivated by the work of Longhi and Materassi, who constructed a realisation of the (centreless) BMS$_4$ algebra for the massive Klein-Gordon field in $3+1$, we build a realisation of the (centreless) massless BMS$_4$ algebra including super-rotations. This realisation depends only on the momenta in the lightcone expressed in celestial coordinates without any reference to the Klein--Gordon field. The quadratic Casimir of the Lorentz algebra is written in terms of a second order differential operator and the volume form plays an essential role in this construction.
The BMS$_4$ algebra in terms of vector fields shows its kinematical nature, like the Poincaré algebra. We also construct a dynamical realisation of BMS$_4$ from the symplectic structure on the solutions of the massless four-dimensional Klein--Gordon field in terms of quadratic expressions of the Fourier modes and plane waves invariant under translations. Using the Mellin transform, we rewrite the Klein--Gordon field in terms of the boost invariant basis, and write down the corresponding BMS$_4$ realization. We also provide the relation with spherical harmonics, linking our results with the solutions of Longhi-Materassi, which are in fact a subset of ours.

Ambiguities in the generation of CFJ-terms in a QED with dimension-5 operators in one loop

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
In this paper, we investigate a Lorentz symmetry breaking extension of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), incorporating 5-dimensional CPT-odd terms at the one-loop level. Employing an independent regularization method, we systematically separate the divergences into regularization-independent contributions and regularization-dependent (surface terms). We demonstrate that these surface terms, potentially contributing to the radiative generation of Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) terms, remain undetermined even when imposing the Ward-Takahashi identity. Our results are consistent with existing literature and emphasize the necessity of a careful and consistent treatment of regularization ambiguities in quantum field theories involving symmetry breaking extensions.

We consider matrix quantum mechanics with multiple bosonic matrices, including those obtained from dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theories. Using the matrix bootstrap, we study simple observables like $\langle \mathop{tr} X^2 \rangle$ in the confining phase of the theory in the infinite $N$ limit. By leveraging the symmetries of these models and using non-linear relaxation, we consider constraints up to level 14, e.g., constraints from traces of words of length $\le 14$. Our results are more precise than large $N$, continuum extrapolations of lattice Monte Carlo simulations, including an estimate of certain simple observables up to 8 significant digits.

In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.

Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order

Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.

Fermion Parity Resolution of Entanglement

Comments:
32 Pages plus appendix, many figures
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Entanglement is analyzed in the Majorana fermion conformal field theory (CFT) in the vacuum, in the fermion state, and in states built from conformal interfaces. In the boundary-state approach, the Hilbert space admits two factorizations for a single interval, producing distinct entanglement spectra determined by spin structures. Although Rényi and relative entropies are shown to be insensitive to these structures, symmetry-resolved entanglement naturally reveals their differences. The Majorana fermion's $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ symmetry, generated by the fermion-parity operator $(-1)^F$, distinguishes bosonic from fermionic sectors, motivating the notion of fermion-parity resolution. While $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$ is naturally a symmetry of the vacuum and fermion reduced density matrices, the Hilbert space factorization is shown to stabilize this symmetry in conformal interface states. When an unpaired Majorana zero mode is present, fermion-parity-resolved entropies display equipartition at all orders in the UV cutoff; in its absence, the breaking of equipartition is quantified by Ramond-sector data. This behavior persists across all states considered. Connections with symmetry-protected topological phases of matter are outlined. All results are compared with twist field computations.

The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work lays the foundation for studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.

We investigate second-order gravitational perturbations in asymptotically AdS black branes, developing a gauge-invariant framework to compute the amplitude ratio between quadratic and linear quasi-normal modes. Our analysis reveals resonant divergences of this ratio when the summed frequencies of two source modes coincide with the frequency of a third mode. These divergences are shown to manifest as poles in three-point fully retarded correlators of the energy-momentum tensor in the holographically dual quantum field theory, establishing a concrete connection between bulk gravitational nonlinearities and observables in the dual boundary theory. Our findings contribute to the understanding of nonlinearity in quantum many-body systems while deepening the holographic dictionary between spacetime dynamics and quantum correlations.

Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.

We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\sim \alpha R^3$, scaled by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being the standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an additive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained by a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the Starobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending the correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and modifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1.9 \times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$.

Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.

We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the complex $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the real $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.

Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.

We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.

We revisit Coincident General Relativity (CGR) in the gauge approach to gravity based on Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the {\it internal-space formulation}, which one of the authors recently proposed in Ref.~[J. Math. Phys. 66 (2025) 5, 052505]. First, we review the standard formulation of STEGR theories in the Palatini approach to gravity, in which formulation we impose the teleparallel and torsion-free conditions by using Lagrange multipliers. Second, we introduce the STEGR theories in the gauge approach to gravity, which is formulated in the internal space, and derive its field equations. We briefly discuss whether the Ostrogradski ghost instability exists and find that the theory may require a degenerate condition to be imposed. Finally, assuming the coincident gauge, we derive CGR in both terms of the action integral and the field equation. Discussing the possible kinematics of the STEGR theory, we formulate a motion of a test scalar particle in the spacetime with non-metricity.

Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.

We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that chaotic instabilities appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.
