Title:
The Impact of Structural Changes on Learning Capacity in the Fly Olfactory Neural Circuit
Katherine Xie, Gabriel Koch Ocker

Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)
The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

1. Expert knowledge elicitation provides information to characterize ecological systems and management options. Linking expert knowledge elicitation with a curated question catalog supports a community of practice for ongoing improvement of question quality.
2. The MetaQuestion web app we introduce here draws on the PlantQuest catalog of questions addressing applied plant ecology and management options, making the catalog available in a flexible form for organizers of expert knowledge elicitation. Organizers can select among questions in the catalog, modify them as needed, and generate an instrument customized to their elicitation project. MetaQuestion makes available PlantQuest questions specialized for the study of invasive species such as pathogens and arthropod pests, such as geographic analyses of prevalence and network analysis of the movement of plant materials.
3. Experts answer questions in the customized instrument and their responses are compiled. For settings where internet access may be sporadic, there are options to download the instrument for experts' work and then upload responses later. MetaQuestion provides the resulting dataset in a CSV file for analysis in users' choice of software
4. Development of the PlantQuest catalog and the MetaQuestion app is ongoing, incorporating lessons learned from applications of the app. The MetaQuestion app could also be adapted to address questions from other subject areas.

Title:
Deep Clustering for Blood Cell Classification and Quantification
Mihaela Macarie-Ancau, Adrian Groza
Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Accurate classification of blood cells plays a key role in improving automated blood analysis for both medical and veterinary applications. This work presents a two-stage deep clustering method for classifying blood cells from high-dimensional signal data. In the first stage, red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs) are separated using a combination of an improved autoencoder and the IDEC algorithm. The second stage further classifies RBC subtypes, pure RBCs, reticulocytes, and clumped RBCs, through a variational deep embedding (VaDE) approach. Due to the lack of detailed cell-level labels, soft classification probabilities are generated from sample-level data to approximate the true distributions. The aim is to contribute to the development of low-cost, automated blood analysis systems suitable for veterinary and biomedical use. Initial results indicate this method shows promise in effectively distinguishing different blood cell populations, even with limited supervision.

The ongoing opioid crisis highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that can be rapidly deployed. This study presents a novel approach to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of opioid addiction, aiming to bridge the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. Speciffcally, we perform a meta-analysis of seven transcriptomic datasets related to opioid addiction by differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, and propose a novel multiscale topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method uses persistent Laplacians to accurately single out important nodes within the PPI network through a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Subsequent functional validation by pathway enrichment and rigorous data curation yield 1,865 high-conffdence targets implicated in opioid addiction, which are cross-referenced with DrugBank to compile a repurposing candidate list. To evaluate drug-target interactions, we construct predictive models utilizing two natural language processing-derived molecular embeddings and a conventional molecular ffngerprint. Based on these models, we prioritize compounds with favorable binding afffnity proffles, and select candidates that are further assessed through molecular docking simulations to elucidate their receptor-level interactions. Additionally, pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations are performed via ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) proffling, providing a multidimensional assessment of druggability and safety. This study offers a generalizable approach for drug repurposing in other complex diseases beyond opioid addiction.

Integrating Mechanistic Modeling and Machine Learning to Study CD4+/CD8+ CAR-T Cell Dynamics with Tumor Antigen Regulation

Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM); Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in hematological malignancies, yet patient responses remain highly variable and the roles of CD4 and CD8 subsets are not fully understood. We present an extended mathematical framework of CAR-T cell dynamics that explicitly models CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic lineages and their interactions with tumor antigen burden. Building on the Kirouac et al. (2023) model of antigen-regulated memory, effector, and exhaustion transitions, our system of differential equations incorporates cytokine-mediated modulation of CD8 proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory regeneration by CD4 T cells. Sensitivity analyses identify effector proliferation burst size, antigen turnover, and CD8 expansion rates as dominant determinants of treatment outcome. Virtual patient simulations reproduce clinical findings that a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio enhances CAR-T expansion and tumor clearance relative to CD8-only products. Finally, we integrate a feed-forward neural network trained on noisy virtual patient data to improve predictive robustness, and apply SHAP analysis to interpret the network predictions and compare them with mechanistic sensitivity analyses. This work highlights the synergistic roles of CD4 and CD8 CAR-T cells and provides a quantitative foundation for optimizing treatments and patient stratification.

Advances in genomic medicine accelerate the identi cation of mutations in disease-associated genes, but the pathogenicity of many mutations remains unknown, hindering their use in diagnostics and clinical decision-making. Predictive AI models are generated to combat this issue, but current tools display low accuracy when tested against functionally validated datasets. We show that integrating detailed conformational data extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) into advanced AI-based models increases their predictive power. We carry out an exhaustive mutational analysis of the disease gene PMM2 and subject structural models of each variant to MDS. AI models trained on this dataset outperform existing tools when predicting the known pathogenicity of mutations. Our best performing model, a neuronal networks model, also predicts the pathogenicity of several PMM2 mutations currently considered of unknown signi cance. We believe this model helps alleviate the burden of unknown variants in genomic medicine.

Title:
An energy-based mathematical model of actin-driven protrusions in eukaryotic chemotaxis

Subjects:
Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)
In eukaryotic cell chemotaxis, cells extend and retract transient actin-driven protrusions at their membrane that facilitate both the detection of external chemical gradients and directional movement via the formation of focal adhesions with the extracellular matrix. Although extensive experimental work has detailed how cellular protrusions and morphology vary under different environmental conditions, the mechanistic principles linking protrusive activity to these factors remain poorly understood. Here, we model the extension of actin-based protrusions in chemotaxis as an optimisation problem, wherein cells balance the detection of chemical gradients with the energetic cost of protrusion formation. Our model, built on the assumption of energy minimisation, provides a framework that successfully reproduces experimentally observed patterns of protrusive activity across a range of biological systems and environmental conditions, suggesting that energetic efficiency may underpin the morphology and chemotactic behaviour of motile eukaryotic cells. Additionally, we leverage the model to generate novel predictions regarding cellular responses to other, experimentally untested environmental perturbations, providing testable hypotheses for future experimental work that may be used to validate and refine the model presented here.

Nano Bio-Agents (NBA): Small Language Model Agents for Genomics
George Hong, Daniel Trejo Banos
Subjects:
Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Genomics (q-bio.GN)
We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate performance.

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)
We introduce FragAtlas-62M, a specialized foundation model trained on the largest fragment dataset to date. Built on the complete ZINC-22 fragment subset comprising over 62 million molecules, it achieves unprecedented coverage of fragment chemical space. Our GPT-2 based model (42.7M parameters) generates 99.90% chemically valid fragments. Validation across 12 descriptors and three fingerprint methods shows generated fragments closely match the training distribution (all effect sizes < 0.4). The model retains 53.6% of known ZINC fragments while producing 22% novel structures with practical relevance. We release FragAtlas-62M with training code, preprocessed data, documentation, and model weights to accelerate adoption.

Title:
Evolution of phenocopying in a dynamical model of developmental trajectories
Yuuki Matsushita, Archishman Raju
Subjects:
Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Developmental trajectories are known to be canalized, or robust to both environmental and genetic perturbations. However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.

BioBO: Biology-informed Bayesian Optimization for Perturbation Design

Comments:
NeurIPS: Structured Probabilistic Inference & Generative Modeling, 2025
Subjects:
Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.

Methodology (stat.ME); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Estimating, understanding, and communicating uncertainty is fundamental to statistical epidemiology, where model-based estimates regularly inform real-world decisions. However, sources of uncertainty are rarely formalised, and existing classifications are often defined inconsistently. This lack of structure hampers interpretation, model comparison, and targeted data collection. Connecting ideas from machine learning, information theory, experimental design, and health economics, we present a first-principles decision-theoretic framework that defines uncertainty as the expected loss incurred by making an estimate based on incomplete information, arguing that this is a highly useful and practically relevant definition for epidemiology. We show how reasoning about future data leads to a notion of expected uncertainty reduction, which induces formal definitions of reducible and irreducible uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach using a case study of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance in Aotearoa New Zealand, estimating the uncertainty reduction if wastewater surveillance were expanded to the full population. We then connect our framework to relevant literature from adjacent fields, showing how it unifies and extends many of these ideas and how it allows these ideas to be applied to a wider range of models. Altogether, our framework provides a foundation for more reliable, consistent, and policy-relevant uncertainty quantification in infectious disease epidemiology.

First-Extinction Law for Resampling Processes

Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Ising dynamics on multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers

Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.

Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research. However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab", a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.

PGCLODA: Prompt-Guided Graph Contrastive Learning for Oligopeptide-Infectious Disease Association Prediction

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at this https URL.

Discrete vs. continuous dynamics in biology: When do they align and when do they diverge?
Shuyun Jiao, David Waxman
Comments:
36 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Many biological systems are governed by difference equations and exhibit discrete-time dynamics. Examples include the size of a population when generations are non-overlapping, and the incidence of a disease when infections are recorded at fixed intervals. For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, continuous-time approximations are frequently employed when small changes occur between discrete time steps.
Here, we present an approach motivated by exactly soluble discrete time problems. We show that such systems have continuous-time descriptions (governed by differential equations) whose solutions precisely agree, at the discrete times, with the discrete time solutions, irrespective of the size of changes that occur.
For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, we develop approximate continuous-time models that can, to high accuracy, capture rapid growth and decay. Our approach employs mappings between difference and differential equations, generating functional solutions that exactly or closely preserve the original discrete time behaviour. It uncovers fundamental structural parallels and also distinctions between the difference equation and the `equivalent' differential equation. The findings we present cover both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous systems.
For completeness, we also consider discrete-time systems with the most rapid oscillatory behaviour possible, namely a sign change each time step. We show, for exactly soluble cases, that such systems also have a continuous-time description, but that this comes at the expense of generally complex-valued solutions.
This work has applications in, for example, population genetics, ecology and epidemic modelling. By bridging discrete and continuous representations of a system, it enhances insights/analysis of different types of dynamics.

The burgeoning growth of open-sourced vision-language models (VLMs) has catalyzed a plethora of applications across diverse domains. Ensuring the transparency and interpretability of these models is critical for fostering trustworthy and responsible AI systems. In this study, our objective is to delve into the internals of VLMs to interpret the functions of individual neurons. We observe the activations of neurons with respects to the input visual tokens and text tokens, and reveal some interesting findings. Particularly, we found that there are neurons responsible for only visual or text information, or both, respectively, which we refer to them as visual neurons, text neurons, and multi-modal neurons, respectively. We build a framework that automates the explanation of neurons with the assistant of GPT-4o. Meanwhile, for visual neurons, we propose an activation simulator to assess the reliability of the explanations for visual neurons. System statistical analyses on top of one representative VLM of LLaVA, uncover the behaviors/characteristics of different categories of neurons.

Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Second-person neuroscience holds social cognition as embodied meaning co-regulation through reciprocal interaction, modeled here as coupled active inference with affect emerging as inference over identity-relevant surprise. Each agent maintains a self-model that tracks violations in its predictive coherence while recursively modeling the other. Valence is computed from self-model prediction error, weighted by self-relevance, and modulated by prior affective states and by what we term temporal aiming, which captures affective appraisal over time. This accommodates shifts in the self-other boundary, allowing affect to emerge at individual and dyadic levels. We propose a novel method termed geometric hyperscanning, based on the Forman-Ricci curvature, to empirically operationalize these processes: it tracks topological reconfigurations in inter-brain networks, with its entro-py serving as a proxy for affective phase transitions such as rupture, co-regulation, and re-attunement.

Suppression of errors in collectively coded information

Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.

Cerebral aneurysms affect three to five percent of the population, and rupture remains a major cause of stroke-related death and disability. Current therapies, surgical clipping, endovascular coiling, and flow diversion, have improved outcomes but each carries limitations. Clipping is invasive and often unsuitable for deep or posterior lesions. Coiling is prone to recurrence from compaction or incomplete occlusion, particularly in wide-neck or fusiform aneurysms. Flow diverters offer improved durability but rely on rigid metallic scaffolds that may malappose in tortuous vessels, compromise branch arteries, delay endothelialization, and necessitate long-term dual antiplatelet therapy. These shortcomings highlight a gap in current management: devices primarily provide mechanical occlusion but fail to conform to complex geometries or reliably promote rapid, complete endothelialization. As a result, aneurysm necks may remain exposed to persistent flow, delayed healing, and thrombosis.
To address this, we propose magnetically guided endothelial BioBots as a next-generation therapeutic strategy. BioBots are biodegradable hydrogel carriers embedded with magnetic nanoparticles and coated with primed endothelial progenitor cells. Delivered through microcatheters and guided by external electromagnetic fields, they can assemble across aneurysm defects. Once localized, they form a conformal, geometry-adaptive endothelial patch that provides immediate antithrombotic protection and, as the hydrogel degrades, leaves behind a stable, functional endothelial lining. By integrating microrobotic navigation with regenerative vascular biology, BioBots may overcome the central limitations of current devices and enable safer, more durable treatment for complex aneurysms.

Title:
Runtime Analysis of Competitive co-Evolutionary Algorithms for Maximin Optimisation of a Bilinear Function

Co-evolutionary algorithms have a wide range of applications, such as in hardware design, evolution of strategies for board games, and patching software bugs. However, these algorithms are poorly understood and applications are often limited by pathological behaviour, such as loss of gradient, relative over-generalisation, and mediocre objective stasis. It is an open challenge to develop a theory that can predict when co-evolutionary algorithms find solutions efficiently and reliable.
This paper provides a first step in developing runtime analysis for population-based competitive co-evolutionary algorithms. We provide a mathematical framework for describing and reasoning about the performance of co-evolutionary processes. To illustrate the framework, we introduce a population-based co-evolutionary algorithm called \pdcoea, and prove that it obtains a solution to a bilinear maximin optimisation problem in expected polynomial time. Finally, we describe settings where \pdcoea needs exponential time with overwhelmingly high probability to obtain a solution.

Chase-and-Run and Chirality in Nonlocal Models of Pattern Formation

Chase-and-run dynamics, in which one population pursues another that flees from it, are found throughout nature, from predator-prey interactions in ecosystems to the collective motion of cells during development. Intriguingly, in many of these systems, the movement is not straight; instead, 'runners' veer off at an angle from their pursuers. This angled movement often exhibits a consistent left-right asymmetry, known as lateralisation or chirality. Inspired by such phenomena in zebrafish skin patterns and evasive animal motion, we explore how chirality shapes the emergence of patterns in nonlocal (integro-differential) advection-diffusion models. We extend such models to allow movement at arbitrary angles, uncovering a rich landscape of behaviours. We find that chirality can enhance pattern formation, suppress oscillations, and give rise to entirely new dynamical structures, such as rotating pulses of chasers and runners. We also uncover how chase-and-run dynamics can cause populations to mix or separate. Through linear stability analysis, we identify physical mechanisms that drive some of these effects, whilst also exposing striking limitations of this theory in capturing more complex dynamics. Our findings suggest that chirality could have roles in ecological and cellular patterning beyond simply breaking left-right symmetry.

Title:
Multi-Modal Artificial Intelligence of Embryo Grading and Pregnancy Prediction in Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Review

Infertility, a pressing global health concern, affects a substantial proportion of individuals worldwide. While advancements in assisted reproductive technology (ART) have offered effective interventions, conventional in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) procedures still encounter significant hurdles in enhancing pregnancy success rates. Key challenges include the inherent subjectivity in embryo grading and the inefficiency of multi-modal data integration. Against this backdrop, the adoption of AI-driven technologies has emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these issues. This article presents a comprehensive review of the progress in AI applications for embryo grading and pregnancy prediction from a novel perspective, with a specific focus on the utilization of different modal data, such as static images, time-lapse videos, and structured tabular data. The reason for this perspective is that reorganizing tasks based on data sources can not only more accurately depict the essence of the problem but also help clarify the rationality and limitations of model design. Furthermore, this review critically examines the core challenges in contemporary research, encompassing the intricacies of multi-modal feature fusion, constraints imposed by data scarcity, limitations in model generalization capabilities, and the dynamically evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. On this basis, it explicitly identifies potential avenues for future research, aiming to provide actionable guidance for advancing the application of multi-modal AI in the field of ART.

Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate candidate molecules' functional responses against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

In this paper a novel optical illusion is described in which purple structures are perceived as purple at the point of fixation, while the surrounding structures of the same purple color are perceived toward a blue hue. As the viewing distance increases, a greater number of purple structures revert to a purple appearance.

Title:
Causality-Induced Positional Encoding for Transformer-Based Representation Learning of Non-Sequential Features

Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation, we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism. Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title:
Explicit Path CGR: Maintaining Sequence Fidelity in Geometric Representations
Sarwan Ali
Comments:
Accepted to CIKM 2025 as Short paper
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.
