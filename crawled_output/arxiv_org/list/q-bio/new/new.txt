Title:
Securing the Language of Life: Inheritable Watermarks from DNA Language Models to Proteins
Zaixi Zhang, Ruofan Jin, Le Cong, Mengdi Wang

Genomics (q-bio.GN)
DNA language models have revolutionized our ability to understand and design DNA sequences--the fundamental language of life--with unprecedented precision, enabling transformative applications in therapeutics, synthetic biology, and gene editing. However, this capability also poses substantial dual-use risks, including the potential for creating pathogens, viruses, and even bioweapons. To address these biosecurity challenges, we introduce two innovative watermarking techniques to reliably track the designed DNA: DNAMark and CentralMark. DNAMark employs synonymous codon substitutions to embed watermarks in DNA sequences while preserving the original function. CentralMark further advances this by creating inheritable watermarks that transfer from DNA to translated proteins, leveraging protein embeddings to ensure detection across the central dogma. Both methods utilize semantic embeddings to generate watermark logits, enhancing robustness against natural mutations, synthesis errors, and adversarial attacks. Evaluated on our therapeutic DNA benchmark, DNAMark and CentralMark achieve F1 detection scores above 0.85 under various conditions, while maintaining over 60% sequence similarity to ground truth and degeneracy scores below 15%. A case study on the CRISPR-Cas9 system underscores CentralMark's utility in real-world settings. This work establishes a vital framework for securing DNA language models, balancing innovation with accountability to mitigate biosecurity risks.

Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Urban ecosystems exhibit complex predator-prey dynamics increasingly disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., noise, habitat fragmentation). Classical Lotka-Volterra (LV) models fail to capture these human-induced stressors, and integrated frameworks incorporating functional responses, stochasticity, and spatial dynamics remain scarce. We develop a comprehensive stochastic model to quantify how human disturbance reshapes predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes, using rat-cat systems as a case study. Our framework extends the LV model to incorporate: (i) human disturbance as an external mortality factor, (ii) Holling Type III functional responses to model predation saturation and prey refugia, (iii) multiplicative noise and periodic forcing to capture stochastic disturbance regimes, and (iv) spatial diffusion across fragmented habitats. We non-dimensionalize the system to generalize dynamics and analyze stability, bifurcations, and noise-induced transitions. Numerical simulations (MATLAB) reveal three key outcomes: (1) Human disturbance disrupts classical oscillations, inducing quasi-periodic cycles and elevating extinction risks; (2) Stochasticity lowers collapse thresholds by 25% compared to deterministic predictions; (3) Spatial diffusion drives pattern formation (e.g., disturbance shadows, prey hotspots) through habitat coupling. Results highlight the extreme vulnerability of urban wildlife to anthropogenic pressures, demonstrating how disturbance intensity governs system stability. The model provides a predictive framework for conservation strategies, emphasizing refuge enhancement and phased interventions synchronized with population cycles.

The challenge of translating vast, multimodal biological data into predictive and mechanistic understanding of cellular function is a central theme in modern biology. Virtual cells, or digital cellular twins, have emerged as a critical paradigm to meet this challenge by creating integrative computational models of cellular processes. This review synthesizes the evolution and current state of the virtual cell, from foundational mechanistic frameworks like the Virtual Cell that employ deterministic and stochastic simulations to the recent transformative impact of artificial intelligence and foundation models. We examine the core technological pillars required to build these models, including the integration of various data types, such as single-cell and spatial omics, the spectrum of modeling approaches, and the bioengineering principles that connect simulation to application. We further discuss key applications, frameworks for model benchmarking and validation, and the significant hurdles that remain, including computational scalability, parameter inference, and ethical considerations, which provides a roadmap for development of predictive virtual cells that promise to revolutionize biomedical research and clinical practice.

In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.

Locomotor behavioural responses are increasingly recognized as sensitive and ecologically relevant indicators for assessing aquatic organism exposure to contaminants. They often occur at concentrations lower than those causing physiological damage, yet their consequences for organisms' fitness and population dynamics remain unclear. Moreover, it is still uncertain how these behavioural endpoints align with traditional toxicological apical endpoints used to assess species sensitivities in risk assessment. This study evaluates the correlation between thresholds triggering locomotor reactions with LC50 values across 19 freshwater and 12 marine invertebrate species exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid and the metal copper. Behavioural responses were measured via videotracking during pulse exposure assays, while 96h acute tests provided species-specific LC50 values for copper. Results reveal strong discrepancies: some highly sensitive species showed no locomotor changes, whereas others tolerant to lethality displayed strong movement responses. For instance, freshwater annelids and gastropods responded markedly to imidacloprid, while marine shrimps exhibited hyperactivity under low copper levels. These findings indicate that relying solely on lethality-based data may underestimate the fraction of species affected by contamination. Integrating behavioural endpoints into population risk assessment frameworks is therefore crucial to better protect aquatic biodiversity.

Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
In response to increasing threats to biodiversity, conservation objectives have been set at national and international level, with the aim of halting biodiversity decline by reducing direct anthropogenic pressures on species. However, the potential effects of conservation policies derived from these objectives on common species remain rarely studied. Common species are often not the primary species targeted by conservation measures and can be distributed across a wide range of habitats that may be affected differently by these measures. We analyse the effect of a range of pressures related to climate, land use and land use intensity, on 263 common bird and 144 common butterfly species from more than 20,000 sites between 2000 and 2021 across 26 European countries. We use land-use and land-use-intensity change scenarios produced previously using the IPBES Nature Futures Framework to support the achievement of conservation objectives, as well as climate change scenarios in order to project the future of biodiversity pressures in Europe up to 2050. To project the future of common biodiversity in these scenarios, we translate these pressure changes into expected variations of abundances for all common bird and butterfly species, as well as for the multi-species indicators used to monitor common biodiversity status in Europe. The projected trends are improved, while still declining, for birds in particular farmland species under the scenarios that meet the conservation objectives, with few effects on butterflies. No scenario shows a stop or a reversal in the decline in abundance of bird and butterfly species that are currently common, on the time scale considered. Our results therefore call into question the fate of common biodiversity under the current conservation policies and the need for other anticipatory frameworks that do not implicitly require a growing need for natural resources.

We present a new 10-meter map of dominant tree species in Swedish forests accompanied by pixel-level uncertainty estimates. The tree species classification is based on spatiotemporal metrics derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, combined with field observations from the Swedish National Forest Inventory. We apply an extreme gradient boosting model with Bayesian optimization to relate field observations to satellite-derived features and generate the final species map. Classification uncertainty is quantified using Shannon's entropy of the predicted class probabilities, which provide a spatially explicit measure of model confidence. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 85% (F1 score = 0.82, Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.81), and mapped species distributions showed strong agreement with official forest statistics (r = 0.96).

High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However, this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities.

From Noise to Insight: Visualizing Neural Dynamics with Segmented SNR Topographies for Improved EEG-BCI Performance

Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Electroencephalography (EEG)-based wearable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and non-stationary neural activity. We introduce in this manuscript a mathematically rigorous framework that combines data-driven noise interval evaluation with advanced SNR visualization to address these limitations. Analysis of the publicly available Eye-BCI multimodal dataset demonstrates the method's ability to recover canonical P300 characteristics across frequency bands (delta: 0.5-4 Hz, theta: 4-7.5 Hz, broadband: 1-15 Hz), with precise spatiotemporal localization of both P3a (frontocentral) and P3b (parietal) subcomponents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the impact of noise interval selection on EEG signal quality. Cross-session correlations for four different choices of noise intervals spanning from early to late pre-stimulus phases also indicate that alertness and task engagement states modulate noise interval sensitivity, suggesting broader applications for adaptive BCI systems. While validated in healthy participants, our results represent a first step towards providing clinicians with an interpretable tool for detecting neurophysiological abnormalities and provides quantifiable metrics for system optimization.

Neural populations exhibit complex recurrent structures that drive behavior, while continuously receiving and integrating external inputs from sensory stimuli, upstream regions, and neurostimulation. However, neural populations are often modeled as autonomous dynamical systems, with little consideration given to the influence of external inputs that shape the population activity and behavioral outcomes. Here, we introduce BRAID, a deep learning framework that models nonlinear neural dynamics underlying behavior while explicitly incorporating any measured external inputs. Our method disentangles intrinsic recurrent neural population dynamics from the effects of inputs by including a forecasting objective within input-driven recurrent neural networks. BRAID further prioritizes the learning of intrinsic dynamics that are related to a behavior of interest by using a multi-stage optimization scheme. We validate BRAID with nonlinear simulations, showing that it can accurately learn the intrinsic dynamics shared between neural and behavioral modalities. We then apply BRAID to motor cortical activity recorded during a motor task and demonstrate that our method more accurately fits the neural-behavioral data by incorporating measured sensory stimuli into the model and improves the forecasting of neural-behavioral data compared with various baseline methods, whether input-driven or not.

Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics are two complementary disciplines that study language from different perspectives. Psycholinguistics focuses on the cognitive processes involved in language production and comprehension, while neurolinguistics investigates the brain bases of these mechanisms. Brain imaging techniques make it possible to identify the regions and networks involved in various psycholinguistic processes, and to better understand the effects of brain lesions on language abilities. By integrating psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic approaches, research provides a deeper understanding of language processing, whether intact or impaired. This knowledge paves the way for more targeted and effective rehabilitation strategies.

Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.

A Novel Mathematical Model of Protein Interactions from the Perspective of Electron Delocalization
Naoto Morikawa
Comments:
36 pages, 12 figures
Subjects:
Biomolecules (q-bio.BM); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Proteins are the workhorse molecules of the cell and perform their biological functions by binding to other molecules through physical contact. Protein function is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein (allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for protein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein communication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how binding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at another distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery in 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein interactions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the discrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the concept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum chemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the definition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete differential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I hope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study chemistry and molecular biology.

On a Neutral Host-Virus Model with Recombination
Raphael Eichhorn, Cornelia Pokalyuk
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Probability (math.PR)
Motivated by observations in sequence data of herpesviruses, we introduce a multi-locus model for the joint evolution of different genotypes in a virus population that is distributed across a population of hosts. In the model, virus particles replicate, recombine, and mutate within their hosts at rates that act on different time scales. Furthermore, virus particles are exchanged between hosts at reinfection events and hosts are replaced by primary infected hosts when they die. We determine the asymptotic type distribution observed in a single host in the limit of large host and virus populations under asymptotic rate assumptions by tracing back the ancestry of the sample. The proposed model may serve as a null model for the evolution of virus populations that are capable of persistence and can be used to estimate the strengths of different evolutionary forces driving genetic diversity, see also [4].

Non-ordinary states of consciousness (NOC) provide an opportunity to experience highly intense, unique, and perceptually rich subjective states. The neural mechanisms supporting these experiences remain poorly understood. This study examined brain activity associated with a self-induced, substance-free NOC known as Auto-Induced Cognitive Trance (AICT). Twenty-seven trained participants underwent high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during rest and AICT. We analyzed the aperiodic component of the power spectrum (1/f), Lempel-Ziv complexity, and sample entropy from five-minute signal segments. A machine learning approach was used to classify rest and AICT, identify discriminative features, and localize their sources. We also compared EEG metrics across conditions and assessed whether baseline activity predicted the magnitude of change during AICT. Classification analyses revealed condition-specific differences in spectral exponents, complexity, and entropy. The aperiodic component showed the strongest discriminative power, followed by entropy and complexity. Source localization highlighted frontal regions, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the left parietal cortex as key contributors to the AICT state. Baseline neural activity in frontal and parietal regions predicted individual variability in the transition from rest to AICT. These findings indicate that AICT engages brain regions implicated in rich subjective experiences and provide mechanistic insights into how self-induced trance states influence neural functioning.

Biochemical Network Motifs Under Periodic Forcing: A Selective Catalogue of Transfer Functions and Frequency Response Properties
Nguyen H.N. Tran, Federico Frascoli, Andrew H.A. Clayton
Subjects:
Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)
Understanding the function of network motifs in an attempt to gain insight into how their combinations create larger reaction networks that drive cellular functions, has been a longstanding pursuit of systems biology. One specific objective within this pursuit is understanding how individual motifs respond to pulsatile and oscillatory signals. This is especially relevant because biochemical networks are often activated by signals that, in nature, occur in the form of pulses and oscillations. A powerful analytical tool for studying such dynamics is the transfer function: a compact frequency-domain description of input-output dynamics. In this work, we derive transfer functions for a set of commonly studied network motifs and characterise their responses to pulsatile and oscillatory inputs. The novelty of this review does not lie in the introduction of new mathematical theorems or biological discoveries, but in bridging well-established frequency domain formalisms from control theory with the analysis of biochemical networks under periodic forcing. In doing so, our contributions are threefold: 1. A systematic derivation and compilation of transfer functions for common network motifs: consolidating results scattered across the literature and establishing a consistent formalism for motif-level transfer functions. 2. Contextualisation of these transfer functions within biological models: extending abstract transfer functions to concrete biological settings so that the results are readily applicable without extensive mathematical labour. 3. Resolution of ambiguity between biological and control-theoretic treatments of feedback: clarifying how feedback loops should be understood within the transfer function formalism and reconciling differences between biology literature and control-oriented literature. This is done by formalising the notion of an intrinsic transfer function.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within hours.

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery are essential.

Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold.

Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.

Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models

A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification, scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning recipe for diverse biology tasks.

Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.

Continuous and reliable access to curated biological data repositories is indispensable for accelerating rigorous scientific inquiry and fostering reproducible research. Centralized repositories, though widely used, are vulnerable to single points of failure arising from cyberattacks, technical faults, natural disasters, or funding and political uncertainties. This can lead to widespread data unavailability, data loss, integrity compromises, and substantial delays in critical research, ultimately impeding scientific progress. Centralizing essential scientific resources in a single geopolitical or institutional hub is inherently dangerous, as any disruption can paralyze diverse ongoing research. The rapid acceleration of data generation, combined with an increasingly volatile global landscape, necessitates a critical re-evaluation of the sustainability of centralized models. Implementing federated and decentralized architectures presents a compelling and future-oriented pathway to substantially strengthen the resilience of scientific data infrastructures, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities and ensuring the long-term integrity of data. Here, we examine the structural limitations of centralized repositories, evaluate federated and decentralized models, and propose a hybrid framework for resilient, FAIR, and sustainable scientific data stewardship. Such an approach offers a significant reduction in exposure to governance instability, infrastructural fragility, and funding volatility, and also fosters fairness and global accessibility. The future of open science depends on integrating these complementary approaches to establish a globally distributed, economically sustainable, and institutionally robust infrastructure that safeguards scientific data as a public good, further ensuring continued accessibility, interoperability, and preservation for generations to come.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. Our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Machine learning was employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from brain network at different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains, but their application to multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale instruction-tuning dataset for multi-omics biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules. This dataset bridges LLMs and complex biological sequence-related tasks, enhancing their versatility and reasoning while maintaining conversational fluency. We also highlight significant limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs on multi-omics tasks without specialized training. To overcome this, we propose ChatMultiOmics, a strong baseline with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating superior biological understanding through Biology-Instructions. Both resources are publicly available, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in multi-omics analysis. The Biology-Instructions is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title:
THFlow: A Temporally Hierarchical Flow Matching Framework for 3D Peptide Design
Dengdeng Huang, Shikui Tu
Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Deep generative models provide a promising approach to de novo 3D peptide design. Most of them jointly model the distributions of peptide's position, orientation, and conformation, attempting to simultaneously converge to the target pocket. However, in the early stage of docking, optimizing conformation-only modalities such as rotation and torsion can be physically meaningless, as the peptide is initialized far from the protein pocket and no interaction field is present. We define this problem as the multimodal temporal inconsistency problem and claim it is a key factor contributing to low binding affinity in generated peptides. To address this challenge, we propose THFlow, a novel flow matching-based multimodal generative model that explicitly models the temporal hierarchy between peptide position and conformation. It employs a polynomial based conditional flow to accelerate positional convergence early on, and later aligns it with rotation and torsion for coordinated conformation refinement under the emerging interaction field. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related features, such as polarity, to further enhance the model's understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering an effective and accurate solution for advancing peptide-based therapeutic development.

Earth-abundant iron is an essential metal in regulating the structure and function of proteins. This study presents the development of a comprehensive X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) database focused on iron-containing proteins, addressing a critical gap in available high-quality annotated spectral data for iron-containing proteins. The database integrates detailed XAS spectra with their corresponding local structural data of proteins and enables direct comparison between spectral features and structural motifs. Utilizing a combination of manual curation and semi-automated data extraction techniques, we developed a comprehensive dataset via extensive literature review, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data, which contains 437 protein structures and 1954 XAS spectrums. Our methods included careful documentation and validation processes to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. This dataset not only centralizes information on iron-containing proteins but also supports advanced data-driven discoveries, such as machine learning, to predict and analyze protein structure and functions. This work underscores the potential of integrating detailed spectroscopic data with structural biology to advance the field of biological chemistry and catalysis.

Title:
Language Models Do Not Have Human-Like Working Memory

Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, we demonstrate that they lack a fundamental aspect of human cognition: working memory. Human working memory is an active cognitive system that enables not only the temporary storage of information but also its processing and utilization, enabling coherent reasoning and decision-making. Without working memory, individuals may produce unrealistic responses, exhibit self-contradictions, and struggle with tasks that require mental reasoning. Existing evaluations using N-back or context-dependent tasks fall short as they allow LLMs to exploit external context rather than retaining the reasoning process in the latent space. We introduce three novel tasks: (1) Number Guessing, (2) Yes-No Deduction, and (3) Math Magic, designed to isolate internal representation from external context. Across seventeen frontier models spanning four major model families, we consistently observe irrational or contradictory behaviors, indicating LLMs' inability to retain and manipulate latent information. Our work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating working memory in LLMs and highlights this limitation as a key bottleneck for advancing reliable reasoning systems. Code and prompts for the experiments are available at this https URL.

Title:
A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks
Michael Fuchs, Mike Steel
Comments:
15 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of several of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are `closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc.) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.

Complexity-Informed Causal Modeling of Neurodevelopmental Trajectories in Pediatric High-Grade Gliomas: Divergences from Neural Stem Cell Signatures
Abicumaran Uthamacumaran, Hector Zenil
Subjects:
Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Pediatric high grade gliomas are lethal evolutionary disorders with stalled developmental trajectories and disrupted differentiation hierarchies. We integrate transcriptional and algorithmic network complexity based perturbation analysis to elucidate gene expression patterns and molecular divergence between Diffuse Midline Gliomas and glioblastoma, revealing shared developmental programs steering cell fate decision making. Our complex systems approach supports the emerging paradigm that pediatric high grade gliomas are neurodevelopmental disorders with hybrid lineage identities and disrupted patterning. We identify dysregulated neurodevelopmental and morphogenetic signatures, alongside bioelectric and neurotransmitter signaling programs that alter synaptic organization, neuronal fate commitment, and phenotypic plasticity, regulating glioma phenotypic switching. Causal drivers and regulators of plasticity were predicted as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, reinforcing the view that pediatric gliomas are disorders of cell fate decisions and collective cellular identity. Decoded plasticity signatures indicate a teleonomic bias toward neural progenitor or neuron like identities, while synaptic transmission gene enrichment supports neuron glioma interactions shaping fate trajectories. These findings advance differentiation therapy as a systems medicine strategy, discovering plasticity regulators to reprogram malignant fates toward stable lineages, offering complex systems based targets for cancer reversion and predictive, preventive, precision oncology.

TRPM4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer (PCa) associated with metastasis or recurrence. There is paucity of information pertaining to TRPM4 characterization and functions at single-cell level in PCa. This study introduces the CEP-IP framework, a novel explainable machine learning approach for the identification of biologically relevant cell subpopulations in single-cell transcriptomics of pairwise genes. The framework combines cell explanatory power (CEP) classification with inflection point (IP) analysis to assign model performance into individual cells, while stratifying transcriptional space into distinct regions. To demonstrate the CEP-IP framework, generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to model relationships between TRPM4 and co-expressed genes in aggressive PCa and benign prostate cells from scRNA-seq data. Genes were identified using Spearman-Kendall dual-filter. Seven ribosomal genes (RPL10, RPL27, RPL28, RPS2, RPS8, RPS12, RPS26; averaged as Ribo gene set) passed dual-filtering specifically in PCa cells. TRPM4-Ribo modeling outperformed alternative cancer gene sets (deviance explained FDR<0.05). The CEP-IP framework identified top-ranked explanatory power (TREP) cells and stratified them using IP analysis into pre-IP and post-IP regions, creating four distinct cell subpopulations per patient. Gene Ontology analysis revealed pre-IP TREP cells enriched for immune-related processes, while post-IP TREP cells enriched for ribosomal, translation, and cell adhesion pathways. In conclusion, the explainable CEP-IP framework allows for the identification of cancer cell subpopulations with distinctive biology and therapeutic implications, applicable to any pairwise gene analysis.

Title:
Effective decoupling of mutations and the resulting loss of biodiversity caused by environmental change

Subjects:

Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.

This study focuses on optimizing species release $S_2$ to control species population $S_1$ through impulsive release strategies. We investigate the conditions required to remove species $S_1$, which is equivalent to the establishment of $S_2$. The research includes a theoretical analysis that examines the positivity, existence, and uniqueness of solutions, the conditions ensuring global stability, and a sufficient condition for controlling the $S_1$-free solution. In addition, we formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the effectiveness of $S_2$ releases, manage the population of $S_1$, and minimize the costs associated with this intervention strategy. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theories and allow visualization of population dynamics under various release scenarios.

We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.

FragmentGPT: A Unified GPT Model for Fragment Growing, Linking, and Merging in Molecular Design

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)
Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities, and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior
Dhruv Mittal, Flávio L. Pinheiro, Vítor V. Vasconcelos
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.
