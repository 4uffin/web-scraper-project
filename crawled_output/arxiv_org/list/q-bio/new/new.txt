Title:
Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging

The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from six heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (this https URL), a novel tool for the systematic assessment of privacy in tabular data, we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, minor issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables (age, sex, race, income, and geolocation) represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.

Title:
Epidemic amplification by correlated superspreading
Noah Silva de Leonardi, Benjamin D. Dalziel
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Infectious pathogens often propagate by superspreading, which focusses onward transmission on disproportionately few infected individuals. At the same time, infector-infectee pairs tend to have more similar transmission potentials than expected by chance, as risk factors assort among individuals who frequently interact. A key problem for infectious disease epidemiology, and in the dynamics of complex systems, is to understand how structured variation in individual transmission will scale to impact epidemic dynamics. Here we introduce a framework that reveals how population structure shapes epidemic thresholds, through autocorrelation of individual reproductive numbers along chains of transmission. We show that chains of superspreading can sustain epidemics even when the average transmission rate in the host population is below one, and derive a mathematical threshold beyond which correlated superspreading allows epidemics in otherwise subcritical systems. Empirical analysis of 47 transmission trees for 13 human pathogens indicate self-organizing bursts of superspreading are common and that many trees are near the critical boundary. Vaccination campaigns that proceed up assortative hierarchies of transmission are predicted to sustain the force of infection until herd immunity is reached, providing a mechanistic basis for threshold dynamics observed in real-world settings. Conversely, modulating correlations in transmission, rather than mean or variance, could enable cities and other complex systems to develop immune-like capacities that suppress contagion while preserving core functions.

Title:
Incorporating Visual Cortical Lateral Connection Properties into CNN: Recurrent Activation and Excitatory-Inhibitory Separation
Jin Hyun Park, Cheng Zhang, Yoonsuck Choe
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
The original Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their modern updates such as the ResNet are heavily inspired by the mammalian visual system. These models include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and long-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas). However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2) separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system. We expect our approach to help align CNN closer to its biological counterpart and better understand the principles of visual cortical computation.

Title:
Polynomial Equivalence of Extended Chemical Reaction Models

Subjects:
Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN); Computational Complexity (cs.CC)
The ability to detect whether a species (or dimension) is zero in Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN), Vector Addition Systems, or Petri Nets is known to increase the power of these models -- making them capable of universal computation. While this ability may appear in many forms, such as extending the models to allow transitions to be inhibited, prioritized, or synchronized, we present an extension that directly performs this zero checking. We introduce a new void genesis CRN variant with a simple design that merely increments the count of a specific species when any other species' count goes to zero. As with previous extensions, we show that the model is Turing Universal. We then analyze several other studied CRN variants and show that they are all equivalent through a polynomial simulation with the void genesis model, which does not merely follow from Turing-universality. Thus, inhibitor species, reactions that occur at different rates, being allowed to run reactions in parallel, or even being allowed to continually add more volume to the CRN, does not add additional simulation power beyond simply detecting if a species count becomes zero.

siDPT: siRNA Efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer
Honggen Zhang, Xiangrui Gao, Lipeng Lai
Subjects:
Genomics (q-bio.GN); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a short double-stranded RNA molecule (about 21-23 nucleotides) with the potential to cure diseases by silencing the function of target genes. Due to its well-understood mechanism, many siRNA-based drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials. However, selecting effective binding regions and designing siRNA sequences requires extensive experimentation, making the process costly. As genomic resources and publicly available siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged to better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data, curating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental errors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased Preference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair dataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking objectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization. We evaluate our approach using two public datasets and one newly collected patent dataset. Our model demonstrates substantial improvement in Pearson correlation and strong performance across other metrics.

Title:
A Visual Discrete Event-based Simulator for Protection of Plants against Herbivores Employed as Computational Optimization Game
Lucas Dietrich, Benjamin Förster, Peter Langendörfer, Thomas Hinze
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Plants come with sophisticated strategies to survive within a highly competing environment. In addition, they need to resist frequent attacks from a variety of herbivores acting alone, in small groups, or in swarms. Since the amount of energy a plant might invest in defense and reproduction is limited, a complex optimization problem emerges. In a shared habitat, plants fight herbivores by shape and camouflage, by the release of specific toxins, or by attracting predators of herbivores. Furthermore, plants alert their surrounding field by signaling substances in the event of an assault. Transported by air or through a network of roots, signaling substances reach neighbors to trigger their defense. The offsprings of a plant commonly grow within a certain distance to benefit from symbiotic protection. We introduce a grid-based visual simulation software for detailed configuration and subsequent processing of the behavior of the resulting system in time and space. In terms of solution to a computational optimization problem inspired by nature, settings with low energy need and long life able to cope with different patterns of attack can be figured out and analyzed. Applications include novel techniques for efficient construction and secure operation of sensor networks.

Title:
Overcoming Output Dimension Collapse: How Sparsity Enables Zero-shot Brain-to-Image Reconstruction at Small Data Scales
Kenya Otsuka, Yoshihiro Nagano, Yukiyasu Kamitani
Subjects:
Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Advances in brain-to-image reconstruction are enabling us to externalize the subjective visual experiences encoded in the brain as images. Achieving such reconstruction with limited training data requires generalization beyond the training set, a task known as zero-shot prediction. Despite its importance, we still lack theoretical guidelines for achieving efficient and accurate reconstruction. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of two widely used models for translating brain activity to latent image features. We define the data scale as the ratio of the number of training samples to the latent feature dimensionality and characterize how each model behaves across data scales. We first show that the naive linear regression model, which uses a shared set of input variables for all outputs, suffers from "output dimension collapse" at small data scales, restricting generalization beyond the training data. We then mathematically characterize the prediction error of the sparse linear regression model by deriving formulas linking prediction error with data scale and other problem parameters. Leveraging the sparsity of the brain-to-feature mapping, this approach enables accurate zero-shot prediction even at small data scales without trapping in output dimension collapse. Our results provide a theoretical guideline for achieving zero-shot reconstruction and highlight the benefits of variable selection in brain-to-image reconstruction.

Title:
Changes in Liver Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Treated with Pegylated Interferon Combined with Oral Antiviral Agents: A 48-Week Observation from a Prospective Cohort Study
Zhao Jinhua
Subjects:
Tissues and Organs (q-bio.TO)
Background and Aims: Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) combined with oral antiviral agents is currently the most widely used and highly effective treatment regimen for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. While effectively suppressing HBV replication, its impact on liver histopathological fibrosis and inflammation remains a critical concern for clinicians and patients. Methods : A total of 625 patients who completed 48 weeks of PEG-IFN combined with oral antiviral therapy were enrolled in this real-world study. Based on their virological response at 48 weeks, patients were categorized into Clearance group and Non-clearance group. Changes in liver biochemistry, fibrosis, and renal function were compared between groups and before/after treatment. Results: No significant differences were observed in baseline blood tests, liver biochemical markers, or histopathological features between the Clearance group and Non-clearance group. Similarly, baseline renal function showed no significant variation. Further analysis revealed that the Clearance group exhibited significant aggravation of liver fibrosis after 48 weeks of treatment, which correlated strongly with alterations in liver enzyme levels. However, one patient who underwent paired liver biopsies before and after treatment demonstrated marked histopathological improvement in fibrosis. This finding underscores the irreplaceable role of liver histopathology in assessing fibrosis and inflammation. Conclusion: PEG-IFN combined with oral antiviral therapy exerts favorable effects on liver fibrosis and inflammation in chronic HBV patients. Non-invasive fibrosis assessment models can monitor fibrotic progression but are susceptible to confounding by hepatic inflammation.

Title:
The evolution of asymmetrical regulation of physiology is central to aging
Mirre J P Simons, Marc Tatar
Comments:

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
The evolutionary biology of aging is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of aging and how to develop anti-aging treatments. Thus far most evolutionary theory concerns the genetics of aging with limited physiological integration. Here we present an intuitive evolutionary framework built on how physiology is regulated and how this regulation itself is then predicted to age. Life has evolved to secure reproduction and avoid system failure in early life, and it is the physiological regulation that evolves in response to those early life selection pressures that leads to the emergence of aging. Importantly, asymmetrical regulation of physiology will evolve as the Darwinian fitness costs of loss of regulation will not be symmetrical. When asymmetrical regulatory systems break during aging, they cause physiological function to drift towards the physiological range where costs of dysregulation are lowest, rendering aging directional. Our model explains many puzzling aspects of the biology of aging. These include why aging appears (but is not) programmed, why aging is gradual yet heterogeneous, why cellular and hormonal signaling are closely related to aging, the compensation law of mortality, why trade-offs between reproduction and aging remain elusive, why longer-lived organisms show more signs of aging during their natural lifespans, and why longer-lived organisms can be less responsive to treatments of aging that work well in short-lived organisms. We provide predictions of our theory that are empirically testable. By incorporating physiological regulation into evolutionary models of aging, we provide a novel perspective to guide empirical research in this still growing field.

A Hypothesis-First Framework for Mechanistic Model Evaluation and Selection in Neuroimaging

Neuroimaging provides rich measurements of brain structure and neural activity, but turning these data into mechanistic insight remains difficult. Statistical models quantify associations without much considerations for how they arise, whereas bio-realistic models directly embody candidate mechanisms but remain hard to deploy rigorously without specialized training. We present a framework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and supplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications, such as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based on predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected model behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a model solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an optimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model is constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire parameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived from the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using standard statistics. In synthetic experiments with known ground truth (Wilson Cowan dynamics), the framework correctly rejects mis-specified hypotheses, penalizes unnecessary degrees of freedom, and preserves valid specifications. This provides a practical, hypothesis-first route to using mechanistic models for neuroimaging without requiring expert-level methodology.

Title:
A Unified and Predictive Measure of Functional Diversity
Adji Bousso Dieng, Amey Pasarkar
Comments:
A single index to accurately measure functional diversity at different biological levels
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
Despite the critical role of functional diversity (FD) in understanding ecological systems and processes, its robust quantification remains a significant challenge. A long-held view in the field is that it is not possible to capture its three facets -- functional richness, functional divergence, and functional evenness -- in a single index. This perspective has prompted recent proposals for FD measurement to use three separate indices, one for each aspect. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that the probability-weighted Vendi Score (pVS), first introduced by Friedman and Dieng (2023), can serve as a powerful functional diversity index that can capture its three facets. We adapt pVS to functional ecology by defining it as the exponential of the Rényi entropy of the eigenvalues of the abundance-weighted trait similarity matrix. This formulation allows pVS to be applicable at any biological level. It can be defined at the species level, at which most existing FD metrics are defined, and at the individual level to naturally incorporate intraspecific trait variation (ITV) when detailed data are available. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the robustness of pVS. We first mathematically prove it satisfies several essential desiderata for FD metrics, including invariance to functional redundancy, set monotonicity, distance monotonicity, and concavity. We then show that pVS consistently exhibits the expected ground-truth behavior on simulated ecosystem scenarios under which many FD metrics fail. By integrating abundances and trait similarities within a single, theoretically sound framework, pVS provides a generally applicable index for ecology.

Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

The weakly electric fish \emph{Eigenmannia virescens} naturally swims back and forth to stay within a moving refuge, tracking its motion using visual and electrosensory feedback. Previous experiments show that when the refuge oscillates as a low-frequency sinusoid (below about 0.5 Hz), the tracking is nearly perfect, but phase lag increases and gain decreases at higher frequencies. Here, we model this nonlinear behavior as an adaptive internal model principle (IMP) system. Specifically, an adaptive state estimator identifies the \emph{a priori} unknown frequency, and feeds this parameter estimate into a closed-loop IMP-based system built around a lightly damped harmonic oscillator. We prove that the closed-loop tracking error of the IMP-based system, where the online adaptive frequency estimate is used as a surrogate for the unknown frequency, converges exponentially to that of an ideal control system with perfect information about the stimulus. Simulations further show that our model reproduces the fish refuge tracking Bode plot across a wide frequency range. These results establish the theoretical validity of combining the IMP with an adaptive identification process and provide a basic framework in adaptive sensorimotor control.

KoMbine: Propagating Statistical and Systematic Errors to Kaplan--Meier Curves
Jeffrey Roskes
Comments:
submitted to JSS
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)
Kaplan--Meier curves are widely used in medical research to evaluate the performance of biomarkers and predict patient outcomes. These curves are often shown without error bands, and even when error bands are provided, they typically only account for the statistical uncertainty resulting from the finite number of patients in the study. In reality, other sources of uncertainty affect the measurements as well. As datasets grow, the statistical uncertainty on the number of patients no longer dominates the overall uncertainty, and other uncertainties are increasingly important to model. The KoMbine package, developed based on procedures used in particle physics, provides the first method to propagate both statistical and systematic uncertainties through the Kaplan--Meier curve estimation processes.

Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data

Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields

Subjects:
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations.
This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences.
The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.

The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts, which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine, jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and multi-objective molecular generation.

Lateral oscillation and body compliance help snakes and snake robots stably traverse large, smooth obstacles

Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.

Effective locomotion in nature happens by transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around near-steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled through complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for multi-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of multi-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help understand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale interactions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical environment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large, intractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor transitions through the real world.

Animals and robots must right themselves after flipping over on the ground. The discoid cockroach pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to dynamically self-right by a somersault. However, because this maneuver is strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier and makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose lateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our previous work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted, winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the phase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case by developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from discontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy dissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg coordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase) accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase), thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more successfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for predicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance and informing robot design.

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH) play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp, highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.

Feature selection (FS) is assumed to improve predictive performance and identify meaningful features in high-dimensional datasets. Surprisingly, small random subsets of features (0.02-1%) match or outperform the predictive performance of both full feature sets and FS across 28 out of 30 diverse datasets (microarray, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq, mass spectrometry, imaging, etc.). In short, any arbitrary set of features is as good as any other (with surprisingly low variance in results) - so how can a particular set of selected features be "important" if they perform no better than an arbitrary set? These results challenge the assumption that computationally selected features reliably capture meaningful signals, emphasizing the importance of rigorous validation before interpreting selected features as actionable, particularly in computational genomics.

Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.
