Title:
Fractional Logistic Growth with Memory Effects: A Tool for Industry-Oriented Modeling

Systems and Control (eess.SY)
The logistic growth model is a classical framework for describing constrained growth phenomena, widely applied in areas such as population dynamics, epidemiology, and resource management. This study presents a generalized extension using Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense (ABC)-type fractional derivatives. Proportional time delay is also included, allowing the model to capture memory-dependent and nonlocal dynamics not addressed in classical formulations. Free parameters provide flexibility for modeling complex growth in industrial, medical, and social systems. The Hybrid Sumudu Variational (HSV) method is employed to efficiently obtain semi-analytical solutions. Results highlight the combined effects of fractional order and delay on system behavior. This approach demonstrates the novelty of integrating ABC-type derivatives, proportional delay, and HSV-based solutions for real-world applications.

Title:
The First Open-Source Framework for Learning Stability Certificate from Data
Zhe Shen
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Before 2025, no open-source system existed that could learn Lyapunov stability certificates directly from noisy, real-world flight data. No tool could answer the critical question: is this controller still stabilizable-especially when its closed-loop system is a total black box. We broke that boundary. This year, we released the first-ever open-source framework that can learn Lyapunov functions from trajectory data under realistic, noise-corrupted conditions. Unlike statistical anomaly detectors, our method does not merely flag deviations-it directly determines whether the system can still be proven stable. Applied to public data from the 2024 SAS severe turbulence incident, our method revealed that, within just 60 seconds of the aircrafts descent becoming abnormal, no Lyapunov function could be constructed to certify system stability. Moreover, this is the first known data-driven stability-theoretic method ever applied to a civil airliner accident. And our approach works with zero access to the controller logic-a breakthrough for commercial aircraft where control laws are proprietary and opaque. The implementation of the proposed framework is open-sourced and available at: this https URL

Title:
Data-Efficient ASR Personalization for Non-Normative Speech Using an Uncertainty-Based Phoneme Difficulty Score for Guided Sampling

Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Sound (cs.SD)
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with non-normative speech from individuals with impairments caused by conditions like cerebral palsy or structural anomalies. The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report, marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive ASR.

Title:
Variational Low-Rank Adaptation for Personalized Impaired Speech Recognition
Niclas Pokel, Pehuén Moure, Roman Boehringer, Shih-Chii Liu, Yingqiang Gao
Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Speech impairments resulting from congenital disorders, such as cerebral palsy, down syndrome, or apert syndrome, as well as acquired brain injuries due to stroke, traumatic accidents, or tumors, present major challenges to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advancements, state-of-the-art ASR models like Whisper still struggle with non-normative speech due to limited training data availability and high acoustic variability. Moreover, collecting and annotating non-normative speech is burdensome: speaking is effortful for many affected individuals, while laborious annotation often requires caregivers familiar with the speaker. This work introduces a novel ASR personalization method based on Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for data-efficient fine-tuning. We validate our method on the English UA-Speech dataset and a newly collected German speech dataset, BF-Sprache, from a child with structural speech impairment. The dataset and approach are designed to reflect the challenges of low-resource settings that include individuals with speech impairments. Our method significantly improves ASR accuracy for impaired speech while maintaining data and annotation efficiency, offering a practical path toward inclusive ASR.

Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Sound (cs.SD)
Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human\textendash computer interaction, yet they lack a plug\textendash and\textendash play full\textendash duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix\textendashVAD, an LLM\textendash based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix\textendash VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix\textendash VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full\textendash duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next\textendash generation human\textendash computer interaction.

Optimal Transport Based Hyperspectral Unmixing for Highly Mixed Observations

2024 14th Workshop on Hyperspectral Imaging and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS)
Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Applications (stat.AP)
We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions, which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target abundance distribution.

Title:
Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens
Ismail Rasim Ulgen, Zongyang Du, Junchen Lu, Philipp Koehn, Berrak Sisman

Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Sound (cs.SD)
Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

Real-Time Markov Modeling for Single-Photon LiDAR: $1000 \times$ Acceleration and Convergence Analysis
Weijian Zhang, Hashan K. Weerasooriya, Prateek Chennuri, Stanley H. Chan
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Asynchronous single-photon LiDAR (SP-LiDAR) is an important imaging modality for high-quality 3D applications and navigation, but the modeling of the timestamp distributions of a SP-LiDAR in the presence of dead time remains a very challenging open problem. Prior works have shown that timestamps form a discrete-time Markov chain, whose stationary distribution can be computed as the leading left eigenvector of a large transition matrix. However, constructing this matrix is known to be computationally expensive because of the coupling between states and the dead time. This paper presents the first non-sequential Markov modeling for the timestamp distribution. The key innovation is an equivalent formulation that reparameterizes the integral bounds and separates the effect of dead time as a deterministic row permutation of a base matrix. This decoupling enables efficient vectorized matrix construction, yielding up to $1000 \times$ acceleration over existing methods. The new model produces a nearly exact stationary distribution when compared with the gold standard Monte Carlo simulations, yet using a fraction of the time. In addition, a new theoretical analysis reveals the impact of the magnitude and phase of the second-largest eigenvalue, which are overlooked in the literature but are critical to the convergence.

Adaptive Altitude Control of a Tethered Multirotor Autogyro under Varying Wind Speeds using Differential Rotor Braking
Tasnia Noboni, Tuhin Das
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)
A tethered multirotor autogyro can function as an unmanned aerial vehicle for energy-efficient and prolonged deployment, as it uses the available wind energy to sustain flight. This article presents an adaptive altitude control strategy for such a device. At a constant wind speed, the equilibrium altitude can be approximated by a quadratic function of the pitch angle. The proposed adaptive control estimates the coefficients of this quadratic function. The estimates are used for altitude control and to attain the maximum altitude (and minimum horizontal drift) for a given wind speed. A feedback controller based on regenerative differential rotor braking is used as the actuation to modulate the autogyro's pitch angle. Implementation of the controller using a control-oriented, higher-order dynamic model demonstrates the controller's capability to regulate the altitude and maintain stable flights under varying wind speeds. Based on the system's maximum altitude tracking performance, the adaptive control is adjusted to improve performance under substantial changes in wind speeds.

Data-Driven State Observers for Measure-Preserving Systems

Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The increasing use of data-driven control strategies gives rise to the problem of learning-based state observation. Motivated by this need, the present work proposes a data-driven approach for the synthesis of state observers for discrete-time nonlinear systems with measure-preserving dynamics. To this end, Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenburger (KKL) observers are shown to be well-defined, where the observer design boils down to determining a nonlinear injective mapping of states and its pseudo-inverse. For its learning-based construction, the KKL observer is related to the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, defined on a Sobolev-type reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) on which they are shown to be normal operators and thus have a spectral resolution. Hence, observer synthesis algorithms, based on kernel interpolation/regression routines for the desired injective mapping in the observer and its pseudo-inverse, have been proposed in various settings of available dataset -- (i) many orbits, (ii) single long orbit, and (iii) snapshots. Theoretical error analyses are provided, and numerical studies on a chaotic Lorenz system are demonstrated.

Journal-ref:
D. Saba and D. Gross, Frequency Domain Stability Conditions for Hybrid AC/DC Systems, Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks, p. 101852, July 2025
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In this article, we investigate small-signal frequency and DC voltage stability of hybrid AC/DC power systems that combine AC and DC transmission, conventional machine- based generation, and converter-interfaced generation. The main contributions of this work are a compact frequency domain representation of hybrid AC/DC systems and associated stability conditions that can be divided into conditions on the individual bus dynamics and conditions on each DC network. The bus- level conditions apply to a wide range of technologies (e.g., synchronous generators, synchronous condensers, grid-forming renewables and energy storage). Moreover, the system-level conditions establish that hybrid AC/DC systems combining a wide range of devices are stable independently of the network topology provided that the frequency response of converters on each DC network is sufficiently coherent relative to the network coupling strength. Additionally, we develop and validate a novel reduced- order damper winding model for multi-machine systems.

Title:
Parasitic actuation delay limits the minimum employable time headway in connected and autonomous vehicles
Guoqi Ma, Prabhakar R. Pagilla, Swaroop Darbha
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Adaptive andcooperative adaptive cruise control (ACC and CACC) and next generation CACC (CACC+) systems usually employ a constant time headway policy (CTHP) for platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In ACC, the ego vehicle uses onboard sensors to measure the position and velocity of the predecessor vehicle to maintain a desired spacing. The CACC and CACC+systems use additional information, such as acceleration(s) communicated through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of the predecessor vehicle(s); these systems have been shown to result in improved spacing performance, throughput, and safety over ACC. Parasitic dynamics are generally difficult to model and the parasitic parameters (delay, lag, etc.) are difficult to obtain. Parasitic actuation delays can have deleterious effects and impose limits on the mobility and safety of CAVs. It is reasonable to assume that the bounds on parasitic actuation delays are known a priori. For CAVs, we need to address both internal stability and string stability in the presence of parasitic actuation delays. This requires robustness of string and internal stability for all values of parasitic actuation delays that are within the specified upper bound. In this paper, we provide the minimum employable time headway for ACC, CACC, and CACC+ (`r' predecessors look-ahead), respectively. The inclusion of the internal stability in the string stability condition is analyzed based on Pontryagin's interlacing theorem for time delay systems. We provide comparative numerical results to corroborate the achieved theoretical results.

Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Emerging Technologies (cs.ET); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel, audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup, with clean speech playback through headphones.

Identifying an optimal set of driver nodes to achieve synchronization via pinning control is a fundamental challenge in complex network science, limited by computational intractability and the lack of general theory. Here, leveraging a degree-based mean-field (annealed) approximation from statistical physics, we analytically reveal how the structural degree distribution systematically governs synchronization performance, and derive an analytic characterization of the globally optimal pinning set and constructive algorithms with linear complexity (dominated by degree sorting, O(N+M). The optimal configuration exhibits a chaotic dependence--a discontinuous sensitivity--on its cardinality, whereby adding a single node can trigger abrupt changes in node composition and control effectiveness. This structural transition fundamentally challenges traditional heuristics that assume monotonic performance gains with budget. Systematic experiments on synthetic and empirical networks confirm that the proposed approach consistently outperforms degree-, betweenness-, and other centrality-based baselines. Furthermore, we quantify how key degree-distribution features--low-degree saturation, high-degree cutoff, and the power-law exponent--govern achievable synchronizability and shape the form of optimal sets. These results offer a systematic understanding of how degree heterogeneity shapes the network controllability. Our work establishes a unified link between degree heterogeneity and spectral controllability, offering both mechanistic insights and practical design rules for optimal driver-node selection in diverse complex systems.

The goal of this paper is to introduce SPADE, a framework for Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient Large Language Model-based text-to-speech (LLM-TTS). Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Speech enhancement for voice pickup in hearables aims to improve the user's voice by suppressing noise and interfering talkers, while maintaining own-voice quality. For single-channel methods, it is particularly challenging to distinguish the target from interfering talkers without additional context. In this paper, we compare two strategies to resolve this ambiguity: personalized speech enhancement (PSE), which uses enrollment utterances to represent the target, and auxiliary-sensor speech enhancement (AS-SE), which uses in-ear microphones as additional input. We evaluate the strategies on two public datasets, employing different auxiliary sensor arrays, to investigate their cross-dataset generalization. We propose training-time augmentations to facilitate cross-dataset generalization of AS-SE systems. We also show that combining PSE and AS-SE (PAS-SE) provides complementary performance benefits, especially when enrollment speech is recorded with the in-ear microphone. We further demonstrate that PAS-SE personalized with noisy in-ear enrollments maintains performance benefits over the AS-SE system.

Dual-Band Flexible Endfire Filtering Antenna With Conformal Capability for Emergency Communication Applications
Fan Qin, Runkai Song, Chao Gu, Wenchi Cheng, Steven Gao
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In this letter, a single-layer dual-band flexible conformal filtering endfire antenna is presented. The proposed antenna is based on two co-designed folded dipoles (FDs) working at two frequencies, where the lower-frequency FD acts as a reflector for the higher-frequency one. Then, by devising an additional reflector for lower-frequency FD, dual-band endfire radiation is realized. Parasitic strips are deliberately introduced around the FDs to generate electric coupling and magnetic coupling in the two operating bands, resulting in significant filtering performance with four radiation nulls. With flexible structure and single-layer configuration, the antenna design exhibits flexible conformability with cylindrical surfaces of diverse diameters, thereby enabling seamless integration into scalable emergency communication systems. To verify our design concept, an antenna prototype is fabricated and measured. The measured working frequency ranges from 1.37 to 1.45 GHz and 1.89 to 2.07 GHz. Out-of-band radiation suppression more than 11 dB is achieved under different bending radii. The proposed design offers several advantages including dual-band endfire filtering radiation, flexible conformability and low-profile.

Wireless Powered MEC Systems via Discrete Pinching Antennas: TDMA versus NOMA

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior computation performance over NOMA.

On the convergence of a numerical scheme for a boundary controlled 1D linear parabolic PIDE

Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We consider an 1D partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) comprising of an 1D parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) and a nonlocal integral term. The control input is applied on one of the boundaries of the PIDE. Partitioning the spatial interval into $n+1$ subintervals and approximating the spatial derivatives and the integral term with their finite-difference approximations and Riemann sum, respectively, we derive an $n^{\rm th}$-order semi-discrete approximation of the PIDE. The $n^{\rm th}$-order semi-discrete approximation of the PIDE is an $n^{\rm th}$-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. We establish some of its salient properties and using them prove that the solution of the semi-discrete approximation converges to the solution of the PIDE as $n\to\infty$. We illustrate our convergence results using numerical examples. The results in this work are useful for establishing the null controllability of the PIDE considered.

A General Optimization Framework for Movable Antenna Systems via Discrete Sampling
Changhao Liu, Weidong Mei, Zhi Chen, Jun Fang, Boyu Ning
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Movable antenna (MA) systems have attracted growing interest in wireless communications due to their ability to reshape wireless channels via local antenna movement within a confined region. However, optimizing antenna positions to enhance communication performance turns out to be challenging due to the highly nonlinear relationship between wireless channels and antenna positions. Existing approaches, such as gradient-based and heuristic algorithms, often suffer from high computational complexity or undesired local optima. To address the above challenge, this letter proposes a general and low-complexity optimization framework for MA position optimization. Specifically, we discretize the antenna movement region into a set of sampling points, thereby transforming the continuous optimization problem into a discrete point selection problem. Next, we sequentially update the optimal sampling point for each MA over multiple rounds. To avoid convergence to poor local optima, a Gibbs sampling (GS) phase is introduced between rounds to explore adjacent and randomly generated candidate solutions. As a case study, we investigate joint precoding and antenna position optimization for an MA-enhanced broadcast system by applying the proposed framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance and significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

TF-Restormer: Complex Spectral Prediction for Speech Restoration
Ui-Hyeop Shin, Jaehyun Ko, Woocheol Jeong, Hyuing-Min Park
Comments:
Preprint. Under review
Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Speech restoration in real-world conditions is challenging due to compounded distortions such as clipping, band-pass filtering, digital artifacts, noise, and reverberation, and low sampling rates. Existing systems, including vocoder-based approaches, often sacrifice signal fidelity, while diffusion models remain impractical for streaming. Moreover, most assume a fixed target sampling rate, requiring external resampling that leads to redundant computations. We present TF-Restormer, an encoder-decoder architecture that concentrates analysis on input-bandwidth with a time-frequency dual-path encoder and reconstructs missing high-frequency bands through a light decoder with frequency extension queries. It enables efficient and universal restoration across arbitrary input-output rates without redundant resampling. To support adversarial training across diverse rates, we introduce a shared sampling-frequency-independent (SFI) STFT discriminator. TF-Restormer further supports streaming with a causal time module, and improves robustness under extreme degradations by injecting spectral inductive bias into the frequency module. Finally, we propose a scaled log-spectral loss that stabilizes optimization under severe conditions while emphasizing well-predicted spectral details. As a single model across sampling rates, TF-Restormer consistently outperforms prior systems, achieving balanced gains in signal fidelity and perceptual quality, while its streaming mode maintains competitive effectiveness for real-time application.

Systems and Control (eess.SY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts, adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling real-time constraints.
Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover. The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults due to the learning component.

Shapley Features for Robust Signal Prediction in Tactile Internet
Mohammad Ali Vahedifar, Qi Zhang
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
The Tactile Internet (TI) requires ultra-low latency and reliable haptic signal transmission, yet packet loss and delay remain unresolved challenges. We present a novel prediction framework that integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) with a ResNet-based Neural Network, where GP acts as an oracle to recover signals lost or heavily delayed. To further optimize performance, we introduce Shapley Feature Values (SFV), a principled feature selection mechanism that isolates the most informative inputs for prediction. This GP+SFV framework achieves 95.72% accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art LeFo method by 11.1%, while simultaneously relaxing TI's rigid delay constraints. Beyond accuracy, SFV operates as a modular accelerator: when paired with LeFo, it reduces inference time by 27%, and when paired with GP, by 72%. These results establish GP+SFV as both a high-accuracy and high-efficiency solution, paving the way for practical and reliable haptic communications in TI systems.

While single-stage post-training such as reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results, multi-stage approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL remain suboptimal. The allocation of data across multiple training stages to maximize LALM capabilities has not been fully explored, and large-scale, high-quality datasets for such research are also lacking. To address these problems, we firstly present AudioMCQ, a comprehensive audio multiple-choice question dataset comprising 571k samples with two kinds of chain-of-thought annotations. Secondly, we investigate the prevalent zero audio-contribution phenomenon in LALMs, where models derive correct answers solely from textual information without processing audio content. We propose Audio-Contribution Filtering to partition data into weak and strong audio-contribution subsets. Based on these insights, we develop two effective post-training paradigms: Weak-to-Strong (SFT on weak audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data) and Mixed-to-Strong (SFT on mixed audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data). We achieve first place in the DCASE 2025 Audio-Question-Answering challenge by using AudioMCQ. Additionally, leveraging our dataset with different training strategies, we achieve 78.2\% on MMAU-test-mini, 75.6\% on MMAU, 67.1\% on MMAR, and 70.7\% on MMSU, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across these benchmarks.

Super-resolution of 4D flow MRI through inverse problem explicit solving

Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)
Four-dimensional Flow MRI (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive, time-resolved imaging of blood flow in three spatial dimensions, offering valuable insights into complex hemodynamics. However, its clinical utility is limited by low spatial resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), imposed by acquisition time constraints. In this work, we propose a novel method for super-resolution and denoising of 4D Flow MRI based on the explicit solution of an inverse problem formulated in the complex domain. Using clinically available magnitude and velocity images, we reconstruct complex-valued spatial signals and model resolution degradation as a convolution followed by subsampling. A fast, non-iterative algorithm is employed to solve the inverse problem independently for each velocity direction. We validate our method on synthetic data generated from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and on physical phantom experiments acquired with 4D Flow MRI. Results demonstrate the potential of our approach to enhance velocity field resolution and reduce noise without the need for large training datasets or iterative solvers.

Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.

Direct Continuous-Time LPV System Identification of Li-ion Batteries via L1-Regularized Least Squares
Yang Wang, Riccardo M.G. Ferrari
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Accurate identification of lithium-ion battery parameters is essential for estimating battery states and managing performance. However, the variation of battery parameters over the state of charge (SOC) and the nonlinear dependence of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) on the SOC complicate the identification process. In this work, we develop a continuous-time LPV system identification approach to identify the SOC-dependent battery parameters and the OCV-SOC mapping. We model parameter variations using cubic B-splines to capture the piecewise nonlinearity of the variations and estimate signal derivatives via state variable filters, facilitating CT-LPV identification. Battery parameters and the OCV-SOC mapping are jointly identified by solving L1-regularized least squares problems. Numerical experiments on a simulated battery and real-life data demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method in battery identification, presenting improved performance compared to conventional RLS-based methods.

Continuous-Time System Identification and OCV Reconstruction of Li-ion Batteries via Regularized Least Squares

Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Accurate identification of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery parameters is essential for managing and predicting battery behavior. However, existing discrete-time methods hinder the estimation of physical parameters and face the fast-slow dynamics problem presented in the battery. In this paper, we developed a continuous-time approach that enables the estimation of battery parameters directly from sampled data. This method avoids discretization errors in converting continuous-time models into discrete-time ones, achieving more accurate identification. In addition, we jointly identify the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and the state of charge (SOC) relation of the battery without utilizing offline OCV tests. By modeling the OCV-SOC curve as a cubic B-spline, we achieve a high-fidelity representation of the OCV curve, facilitating its estimation. Through solving a rank and L1 regularized least squares problem, we jointly identify battery parameters and the OCV-SOC relation from the battery's dynamic data. Simulated and real-life data demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.

The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically, our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication pipeline or reducing data rates.

This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the security, data rate, and sensing performance of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. We employ a random frequency and pulse repetition interval (PRI) agility (RFPA) method for the waveform design, where the necessary random sequences are governed by shared secrets. These secrets, which can be pre-shared or generated via channel reciprocity, obfuscate critical radar parameters like Doppler frequency and pulse start times, thereby significantly impeding the ability to perform reconnaissance from a passive adversary without the secret key. To further introduce enhanced data throughput, we also introduce a hybrid information embedding scheme that integrates amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), index modulation (IM), and spatial modulation (SM), for which a low-complexity sparse-matched filter receiver is proposed for accurate decoding with practical complexity. Finally, the excellent range-velocity resolution and clutter suppression of the proposed waveform are analyzed via the ambiguity function (AF).

We propose an adversarially robust physical layer authentication (AR-PLA) framework tailored for non-stationary multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels. The framework integrates sequential Bayesian decision-making, deep feature extraction via contrastive learning, and generative adversarial modeling to simulate adaptive spoofers. Unlike conventional methods that assume stationary channels or independent observations, our approach explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial correlations, line-of-sight (LoS) blockages, and dynamic spoofing strategies. A comprehensive analytical characterization of the authentication performance using both 2-state and 3-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) with moving-average online adaptation is also provided, with closed-form recursions for loglikelihood ratios, detection probabilities, and steady-state approximations, which demonstrate significant robustness improvement over classical sequential authentication schemes.

In this paper, we propose hybrid real- and complex-valued neural networks for speech enhancement. Real- or complex-valued models are either inefficient or present high complexity. We devise a straightforward design method for extending a real-valued network into its hybrid counterpart. Based on speech intelligibility and quality metrics, we compare the real, complex, and hybrid versions of a convolutional and a convolutional-recurrent architecture. The hybrid network consistently outperforms its counterparts with the same number of parameters. Additionally, the hybrid models' complexity in terms of multiply-accumulate operations is substantially lower than that of their counterparts.

Speech enhancement (SE) improves degraded speech's quality, with generative models like flow matching gaining attention for their outstanding perceptual quality. However, the flow-based model requires multiple numbers of function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve stable and satisfactory performance, leading to high computational load and poor 1-NFE performance. In this paper, we propose MeanSE, an efficient generative speech enhancement model using mean flows, which models the average velocity field to achieve high-quality 1-NFE enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MeanSE significantly outperforms the flow matching baseline with a single NFE, exhibiting extremely better out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

An enhanced statistical feature fusion approach using an improved distance evaluation algorithm and weighted K-nearest neighbor for bearing fault diagnosis
Amir Eshaghi Chaleshtori, Abdollah Aghaie
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Bearings are among the most failure-prone components in rotating machinery, and their condition directly impacts overall performance. Therefore, accurately diagnosing bearing faults is essential for ensuring system stability. However, detecting such malfunctions in noisy environments, where data is collected from multiple sensors, necessitates the extraction and selection of informative features. This paper proposes an improved distance evaluation algorithm combined with a weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for bearing fault diagnosis. The process begins with extracting and integrating statistical features of vibration across the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. Next, the improved distance evaluation algorithm assigns weights to the extracted features, retaining only the most informative ones by eliminating insensitive features. Finally, the selected features are used to train the weighted KNN classifier. To validate the proposed method, we employ bearing data from the University of Ottawa. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying bearing faults.

Vision-Intelligence-Enabled Beam Tracking for Cross-Interface Water-Air Optical Wireless Communications

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
The escalating development of oceanic applications like underwater surveillance and mineral exploration, is motivating real-time wireless backhaul of the considerable observation data. Such prospects can be hardly realized by the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater applications due to its great potential for broadband underwater transmission. However, the implementations of water-air OWC can be rather challenging, especially when penetrating the fluctuating interface, where the direction of refracted signals changes dynamically, causing severe beam misalignment with airborne stations. This has necessitated real-time transceiver alignment adaptable to the sophisticated oceanic environment, which has yet to be addressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical channel model for water-air optical wireless transmission across the fluctuating sea surface. Based on the model, we propose a vision-based beam tracking algorithm that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) methods for dynamic channel prediction. The proposed algorithm integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), which further incorporates the attention mechanism to effectively extract critical spatio-temporal features from the vision data. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform its classical counterparts in maintaining receiving signal strength and supressing the vision noises, which demonstrates its robustness against the the harsh conditions of water-air OWC systems.

Efficient Digital Methods to Quantify Sensor Output Uncertainty

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Accurate characterization of sensor output uncertainty is important for reliable data interpretation in many applications. Here, we investigate the impact of transducer-level measurement uncertainty on overall sensor measurement accuracy due to limited-precision information about sensor components. We explain our method using thermopile-based sensors as an example class of sensors. We show how sensor calibration and conversion equations, which are an essential part of all sensing systems, propagate uncertainties resulting from the quantization of calibration parameters, to the final, compensated sensor output. The experimental results show that the epistemic uncertainty of calibration-related quantities leads to absolute error in the sensor output as high as 5.3 °C (and relative error as high as 25.7%) for one commonly-used thermopile sensor. In one instance of using the epistemic uncertainty information in edge detection, we show reduction of false-positives edges to zero for the conventional Canny operator, while maintaining accuracy. We show these ideas are practical and possible on actual embedded sensor systems by prototyping them on two commercially-available uncertainty tracking hardware platforms, one with average power dissipation 16.7 mW and 42.9x speedup compared to the equal-confidence Monte Carlo computation (the status quo), and the other with average power dissipation 147.15 mW and 94.4x speedup, paving the way for use in real time.

ECG biometrics offer a unique, secure authentication method, yet their deployment on wearable devices faces real-time processing, privacy, and spoofing vulnerability challenges. This paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model (MobileNetV1+GRU) for ECG-based authentication, injection of 20dB Gaussian noise & custom preprocessing. We simulate wearable conditions and edge deployment using the ECGID, MIT-BIH, CYBHi, and PTB datasets, achieving accuracies of 99.34%, 99.31%, 91.74%, and 98.49%, F1-scores of 0.9869, 0.9923, 0.9125, and 0.9771, Precision of 0.9866, 0.9924, 0.9180 and 0.9845, Recall of 0.9878, 0.9923, 0.9129, and 0.9756, equal error rates (EER) of 0.0009, 0.00013, 0.0091, and 0.0009, and ROC-AUC values of 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9985, and 0.9998, while under FGSM adversarial attacks, accuracy drops from 96.82% to as low as 0.80%. This paper highlights federated learning, adversarial testing, and the need for diverse wearable physiological datasets to ensure secure and scalable biometrics.

Why Speech Deepfake Detectors Won't Generalize: The Limits of Detection in an Open World
Visar Berisha, Prad Kadambi, Isabella Lenz
Subjects:
Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Speech deepfake detectors are often evaluated on clean, benchmark-style conditions, but deployment occurs in an open world of shifting devices, sampling rates, codecs, environments, and attack families. This creates a ``coverage debt" for AI-based detectors: every new condition multiplies with existing ones, producing data blind spots that grow faster than data can be collected. Because attackers can target these uncovered regions, worst-case performance (not average benchmark scores) determines security. To demonstrate the impact of the coverage debt problem, we analyze results from a recent cross-testing framework. Grouping performance by bona fide domain and spoof release year, two patterns emerge: newer synthesizers erase the legacy artifacts detectors rely on, and conversational speech domains (teleconferencing, interviews, social media) are consistently the hardest to secure. These findings show that detection alone should not be relied upon for high-stakes decisions. Detectors should be treated as auxiliary signals within layered defenses that include provenance, personhood credentials, and policy safeguards.

Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective

Subjects:
Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.

A Recovery Theory for Diffusion Priors: Deterministic Analysis of the Implicit Prior Algorithm

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors, but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set, we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions: uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

PIRF: Physics-Informed Reward Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Models

Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However, a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes, highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling.

Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler subtasks.

Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment

Subjects:
Computation and Language (cs.CL); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask: given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Synthesis of optimization algorithms typically follows a {\em design-then-analyze\/} approach, which can obscure fundamental performance limits and hinder the systematic development of algorithms that operate near these limits. Recently, a framework grounded in robust control theory has emerged as a powerful tool for automating algorithm synthesis. By integrating design and analysis stages, fundamental performance bounds are revealed and synthesis of algorithms that achieve them is enabled. In this paper, we apply this framework to design algorithms for solving strongly convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints. Our approach yields a single-loop, gradient-based algorithm whose convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the constraint matrix. This improves upon the best known rate within the same algorithm class, which depends on the product of the condition numbers of the objective function and the constraint matrix.

With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision applications that process image and video data as input, interest has emerged in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact, given the variety of vision tasks, associated NN models and datasets, a consolidated platform is needed as a common ground to implement and evaluate compression methods optimized for downstream vision tasks. CompressAI-Vision is introduced as a comprehensive evaluation platform where new coding tools compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and "split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy. This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is adopted by the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) for the development the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. The software is available publicly at this https URL.

Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration.

We implemented a frequency band-based matched filtering strategy that balances resolution and contrast. The system's inherent imaging capabilities were evaluated and validated in flow phantom and human CA experiments. In the phantom study, 3D/4D power Doppler image and speckle-tracking analyses confirmed the system's ability to resolve flow structures and hemodynamics. In the human study, the CA bifurcation flow structure and its local pulsatile flow dynamics were successfully reconstructed. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a large-footprint, few-element cUSi system for 4D CA flow assessment.

This paper presents a benchmark for singing voice enhancement. The development of singing voice enhancement is limited by the lack of realistic evaluation data. To address this gap, this paper introduces SingVERSE, the first real-world benchmark for singing voice enhancement, covering diverse acoustic scenarios and providing paired, studio-quality clean references. Leveraging SingVERSE, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and uncover a consistent trade-off between perceptual quality and intelligibility. Finally, we show that training on in-domain singing data substantially improves enhancement performance without degrading speech capabilities, establishing a simple yet effective path forward. This work offers the community a foundational benchmark together with critical insights to guide future advances in this underexplored domain. Demopage: this https URL

UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems with Fluid Antennas

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions, and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC systems.

Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.

Next-Generation Aerial Robots -- Omniorientational Strategies: Dynamic Modeling, Control, and Comparative Analysis
Ali Kafili Gavgani, Amin Talaeizadeh, Aria Alasty, Hossein Nejat Pishkenari, Esmaeil Najafi
Subjects:
Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed: a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system, highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

Real-time Hybrid System Identification with Online Deterministic Annealing
Christos Mavridis, Karl Henrik Johansson
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We introduce a real-time identification method for discrete-time state-dependent switching systems in both the input--output and state-space domains. In particular, we design a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales; a stochastic approximation algorithm implements an online deterministic annealing scheme at a slow timescale and estimates the mode-switching signal, and an recursive identification algorithm runs at a faster timescale and updates the parameters of the local models based on the estimate of the switching signal. We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we address specific challenges that arise in the application of the proposed methodology in identification of more general switching systems. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

In this paper, we investigate 3-D localization and frequency synchronization with multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) for a stationary user equipment (UE). In line with the 6G goals of sustainability and efficiency, we focus on a frugal communication scenario with minimal spatial and spectral resources (i.e., narrowband single-input single-ouput system), considering both the presence and blockage of the line-of-sight (LoS) path between the base station (BS) and the UE. We design a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based LoS detector, channel parameter estimation and localization algorithms, with varying complexity. To verify the efficiency of our estimators, we compare the root mean-squared error (RMSE) to the Cramér- Rao bound (CRB) of the unknown parameters. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our algorithms to the presence of uncontrolled multi-path components (MPC) and various levels of CFO. Simulation results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under minimal hardware and spectral requirements, and a wide range of operating conditions, thereby confirming the viability of RIS-aided frugal localization in 6G scenarios.

Universal Scanning GUI Tool for Available and Usable TV White Space (TVWS) Spectrum

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this era of advanced communication technologies, many remote rural and hard-to-reach areas still lack Internet access due to technological, geographical, and economic challenges. The TV white space (TVWS) technology has proven to be effective and feasible in connecting these areas to Internet service in many parts of the world. The TVWS-based systems operate based on geolocation white space databases (WSDB) to protect the primary systems from harmful interference. Thus, there is a critical need to identify the available and usable channels that can be utilized by secondary white space devices (WSDs) in a specific geographic area. In this work, we developed a generalized and flexible graphical user interface (GUI) tool to evaluate the availability and usability of the TVWS channels and their noise levels at each geographic location within the analyzed area. The developed tool has many features and capabilities, such as allowing users to scan the TVWS spectrum for any geographic area in the world and any frequency band in the TVWS spectrum. Moreover, it allows the user to apply widely used terrain-based radio propagation models. It provides the flexibility to import the elevation terrain profile of any region with the desired spatial accuracy and resolution. In addition, various system parameters, including those related to regulation rules, can be modified in the tool. This tool exports to an external dataset file the output data of the available and usable TVWS channels and their noise levels, and it also visualizes these data interactively. Moreover, we develop an RF planning and optimization algorithm in this tool to evaluate the various communication metrics between the TVWS BS and the user equipment (UEs). This tool also provides an RF optimization technique using Ray Tracing to find the best azimuth and elevation orientation for both the BS and the UE antennas.

Artificial Intelligence-derived Photoplethysmography Age as a Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG), increasingly available through wearable devices, provides a non-invasive means of monitoring human hemodynamics. In this study, we introduce artificial intelligence-derived photoplethysmography (AI-PPG) age, a deep learning-based estimate of biological age from raw PPG signals, and evaluate its potential as a digital biomarker for cardiovascular health.
Methods: We developed a deep learning model with a distribution-aware loss function to reduce bias from imbalanced data. The model was trained and evaluated on the UK Biobank cohort (N = 212,231). We analyzed the association between the AI-PPG age gap (AI-PPG age minus calendar age) and multiple cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes, assessed its longitudinal value using serial PPG measurements, and externally validated its generalizability in an independent MIMIC-III-derived cohort (N = 2,343).
Results: After adjusting for key confounders, participants with an AI-PPG age gap greater than 9 years have a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio of 2.37, p = 8.46x10$^{-80}$), as well as seven secondary outcomes including coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (all p < 0.005). Conversely, those with a gap below -9 years show a lower risk profile. Longitudinal analysis demonstrates that changes in AI-PPG age add predictive value over time. In the external validation cohort, each one-year increase in AI-PPG age gap is associated with higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio of 1.02, p = 0.01).
Conclusions: AI-PPG age is a scalable, non-invasive biomarker for cardiovascular health assessment. Integrated with wearable devices, it may enable population-level screening, personalized monitoring, and early intervention.

Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)
The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is a widely used in vivo platform for studying angiogenesis, especially in relation to tumor growth, drug delivery, and vascular this http URL the topology and morphology of developing blood vessels is a key evaluation metric, accurate vessel segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of angiogenesis. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to its subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms remains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between CAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to perform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate intermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate Domain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle cross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily concentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate domain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method outperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in UDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability. The CAM dataset and source codes are available at this https URL.

We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at this https URL .

In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.

Low-Complexity Optimization of Antenna Switching Schemes for Dynamic Channel Sounding

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Understanding wireless channels is crucial for the design of wireless systems. For mobile communication, sounders and antenna arrays with short measurement times are required to simultaneously capture the dynamic and spatial channel characteristics. Switched antenna arrays are an attractive option that can overcome the high cost of real arrays and the long measurement times of virtual arrays. Optimization of the switching sequences is then essential to avoid aliasing and increase the accuracy of channel parameter estimates. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive analysis of the design of switching sequences. We first review the conventional spatio-temporal ambiguity function, extend it to dual-polarized antenna arrays, and analyze its prohibitive complexity when applied to ultra-massive antenna arrays. We thus propose a new method that uses the Fisher information matrix to tackle the estimation accuracy. We also propose to minimize the ambiguity by choosing a switching sequence that minimizes side lobes in its Fourier spectrum. In this sense, we divide the sequence design problem into Fourier-based ambiguity reduction and Fisher-based accuracy improvement, and coin the resulting design approach as Fourier-Fisher. Simulations and measurements show that the Fourier-Fisher approach achieves identical performance and significantly lower computational complexity than that of the conventional ambiguity-based approach.

Accurately forecasting sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Arctic is critical to global ecosystem health and navigation safety. However, current methods still is confronted with two challenges: 1) these methods rarely explore the long-term feature dependencies in the frequency domain. 2) they can hardly preserve the high-frequency details, and the changes in the marginal area of the sea ice cannot be accurately captured. To this end, we present a Frequency-Compensated Network (FCNet) for Arctic SIC prediction on a daily basis. In particular, we design a dual-branch network, including branches for frequency feature extraction and convolutional feature extraction. For frequency feature extraction, we design an adaptive frequency filter block, which integrates trainable layers with Fourier-based filters. By adding frequency features, the FCNet can achieve refined prediction of edges and details. For convolutional feature extraction, we propose a high-frequency enhancement block to separate high and low-frequency information. Moreover, high-frequency features are enhanced via channel-wise attention, and temporal attention unit is employed for low-frequency feature extraction to capture long-range sea ice changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on a satellite-derived daily SIC dataset, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed FCNet. Our codes and data will be made public available at: this https URL .

This paper introduces a novel filter, the Adaptive Weight Modified Riesz Mean Filter (AWMRmF), designed for the effective removal of high-density salt and pepper noise (SPN). AWMRmF integrates a pixel weight function and adaptivity condition inspired by the Different Adaptive Modified Riesz Mean Filter (DAMRmF). In my simulations, I evaluated the performance of AWMRmF against established filters such as Adaptive Frequency Median Filter (AFMF), Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF), Adaptive Cesaro Mean Filter (ACmF), Adaptive Riesz Mean Filter (ARmF), and Improved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (IAWMF). The assessment was conducted on 26 typical test images, varying noise levels from 60% to 95%. The findings indicate that, in terms of both Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics, AWMRmF outperformed other state-of-the-art filters. Furthermore, AWMRmF demonstrated superior performance in mean PSNR and SSIM results as well.

CryoSplat: Gaussian Splatting for Cryo-EM Homogeneous Reconstruction
Suyi Chen, Haibin Ling
Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in self-contained pipelines. In parallel, differentiable rendering techniques such as Gaussian splatting have demonstrated remarkable scalability and efficiency for volumetric representations, suggesting a natural fit for GMM-based cryo-EM reconstruction. However, off-the-shelf Gaussian splatting methods are designed for photorealistic view synthesis and remain incompatible with cryo-EM due to mismatches in the image formation physics, reconstruction objectives, and coordinate systems. Addressing these issues, we propose cryoSplat, a GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a view-dependent normalization term and FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. These innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoSplat over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

In this study, we revisit key training strategies in machine learning often overlooked in favor of deeper architectures. Specifically, we explore balancing strategies, activation functions, and fine-tuning techniques to enhance speech emotion recognition (SER) in naturalistic conditions. Our findings show that simple modifications improve generalization with minimal architectural changes. Our multi-modal fusion model, integrating these optimizations, achieves a valence CCC of 0.6953, the best valence score in Task 2: Emotional Attribute Regression. Notably, fine-tuning RoBERTa and WavLM separately in a single-modality setting, followed by feature fusion without training the backbone extractor, yields the highest valence performance. Additionally, focal loss and activation functions significantly enhance performance without increasing complexity. These results suggest that refining core components, rather than deepening models, leads to more robust SER in-the-wild.

Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems, driven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population), complex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in resource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings. To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections), DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved 95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance improved clinician performance by 17.21%.

Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction

Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm where one cancer corresponds to one model. However, it naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot utilize the knowledge of other cancers. Although a multi-task learning-like framework has been studied recently, it usually has high demands on computational resources and needs considerable costs in iterative training on ultra-large multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper makes a paradigm shift to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It has three major parts: (i) we curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors); (ii) beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmark, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of transferability; (iii) we further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. We hope CROPKT could serve as an inception and lay the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

Mitotic figures represent a key histoprognostic feature in tumor pathology, providing crucial insights into tumor aggressiveness and proliferation. However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figure detection approach based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv12 object detection architecture. Our method achieved an F1-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set (hotspots only) and ranked second on the final test leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.7216 across complex and heterogeneous whole-slide regions, without relying on external data.

Systems and Control (eess.SY); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We analyze offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies with uncertain disturbances. First, we consider the scenario where the exogenous variable can be estimated in a controlled environment, and subsequently, consider a more practical and challenging scenario where it is unknown in a stochastic setting. Our approach builds on the fundamental learning-based framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), combined with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to design the algorithms and derive sample-based approximations motivated from the Markov decision process (MDP)-based approaches. For the scenario involving non-measurable disturbances, we further establish stability and convergence guarantees for the learned control gains under sample-based approximations. The overall methodology emphasizes simplicity while providing rigorous guarantees. Finally, numerical experiments focus on the intricacies and validations for the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances.

Speech enhancement remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and perceptual quality.

Unlike prior masked generative models with random masking, MAGE employs a scarcity-aware coarse-to-fine masking strategy that prioritizes frequent tokens in early steps and rare tokens in later refinements, improving efficiency and generalization. We also propose a lightweight corrector module that further stabilizes inference by detecting low-confidence predictions and re-masking them for refinement. Built on BigCodec and finetuned from Qwen2.5-0.5B, MAGE is reduced to 200M parameters through selective layer retention. Experiments on DNS Challenge and noisy LibriSpeech show that MAGE achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and significantly reduces word error rate for downstream recognition, outperforming larger baselines.

Measuring Prosody Diversity in Zero-Shot TTS: A New Metric, Benchmark, and Exploration
Yifan Yang, Bing Han, Hui Wang, Long Zhou, Wei Wang, Mingyu Cui, Xu Tan, Xie Chen
Subjects:
Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
Prosody diversity is essential for achieving naturalness and expressiveness in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS). However, frequently used acoustic metrics capture only partial views of prosodic variation and correlate poorly with human perception, leaving the problem of reliably quantifying prosody diversity underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProsodyEval, a prosody diversity assessment dataset that provides Prosody Mean Opinion Score (PMOS) alongside conventional acoustic metrics. ProsodyEval comprises 1000 speech samples derived from 7 mainstream TTS systems, with 2000 human ratings. Building on this, we propose the Discretized Speech Weighted Edit Distance (DS-WED), a new objective diversity metric that quantifies prosodic variation via weighted edit distance over semantic tokens. Experiments on ProsodyEval show that DS-WED achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgments than existing acoustic metrics, while remaining highly robust in speech tokenization from HuBERT and WavLM. Leveraging DS-WED, we benchmark state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems on LibriSpeech test-clean and Seed-TTS test-en, and further explorations uncover several factors that influence prosody diversity, including generative modeling paradigms, duration control, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that current large audio language models (LALMs) remain limited in capturing prosodic variations. Audio samples are available at this https URL.

Snakes can bend their elongate bodies in various forms to traverse various environments. We understand how snakes use lateral bending to push against asperities on flat ground for propulsion, and snake robots can do so effectively. However, snakes can also use vertical bending to push against terrain of large height variation for propulsion, and they can adjust it to adapt to novel terrain presumably using mechano-sensing feedback control. Although some snake robots can traverse uneven terrain, few have used vertical bending for propulsion, and how to control it in novel environments is poorly understood. Here we systematically studied a snake robot with force sensors pushing against large bumps using vertical bending to understand the role of sensory feedback control. We compared a feedforward controller and four feedback controllers that use different senses and generate distinct bending patterns and body-terrain interaction. We challenged the robot with increasing backward load and novel terrain geometry that break its contact with the terrain. We further varied how much the feedback control modulated bending to conform to or push against the terrain to test their effects. Feedforward propagation of vertical bending generated large propulsion when the shape matched terrain geometry. However, when perturbations caused loss of contact, the robot easily lost propulsion or had motor overload. Contact feedback control resolved these by improving contact. Yet excessive conformation interrupted propagation and excessive pushing stalled motors. Unlike that using lateral bending, for propulsion generation using vertical bending, body weight can help maintain contact with the environment but may also overload motors. Our results will help snake robots better traverse terrain with large height variation and can inform how snakes use sensory feedback to control vertical bending for propulsion.

This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. Unlike the previous studies of operator regularization, our framework requires no control of the Lipschitz constant in learning the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.

Audio fingerprinting techniques have seen great advances in recent years, enabling accurate and fast audio retrieval even in conditions when the queried audio sample has been highly deteriorated or recorded in noisy conditions. Expectedly, most of the existing work is centered around music, with popular music identification services such as Apple's Shazam or Google's Now Playing designed for individual audio recognition on mobile devices. However, the spectral content of speech differs from that of music, necessitating modifications to current audio fingerprinting approaches. This paper offers fresh insights into adapting existing techniques to address the specialized challenge of speech retrieval in telecommunications and cloud communications platforms. The focus is on achieving rapid and accurate audio retrieval in batch processing instead of facilitating single requests, typically on a centralized server. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how this approach can be utilized to support audio clustering based on speech transcripts without undergoing actual speech-to-text conversion. This optimization enables significantly faster processing without the need for GPU computing, a requirement for real-time operation that is typically associated with state-of-the-art speech-to-text tools.

The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its theoretical properties are still not well understood. As with classic neural networks, a common approach to improve these models is to increase their size and depth. However, such strategies may be suboptimal, as several works have shown that adding more layers yields increasingly diminishing returns. More importantly, prior studies have shown that increasing depth may lead to model collapse, i.e., all the tokens converge to a single cluster, undermining the ability of LLMs to generate diverse outputs. Building on differential equation models for the transformer dynamics, we prove that all the tokens in a transformer asymptotically converge to a cluster as depth increases. At the technical level we leverage tools from control theory, including consensus dynamics on manifolds and input-to-state stability (ISS). We then extend our analysis to autoregressive models, exploiting their structure to further generalize the theoretical guarantees.

Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.

With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the risks of data tampering and malicious information injection have intensified, making efficient threat detection in large-scale distributed sensor networks a pressing challenge. To address the decline in malicious information detection efficiency as network scale expands, this paper investigates a robust set partitioning strategy and, on this basis, develops a distributed attack detection framework with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we introduce a gain mutual influence metric to characterize the inter-subset interference arising during gain updates, thereby revealing the fundamental reason for the performance gap between distributed and centralized algorithms. Building on this insight, the set partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, which significantly reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance, and ensures that the distributed setting under subset partitioning preserves the same theoretical performance bound as the baseline algorithm. Unlike conventional clustering methods, the proposed set partitioning strategy leverages the intrinsic observational features of sensors for robust partitioning, thereby enhancing resilience to noise and interference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method limits the performance gap between distributed and centralized detection to no more than 1.648$\%$, while the computational cost decreases at an order of $O(1/m)$ with the number of subsets $m$. Therefore, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces computational overhead while preserving detection accuracy, offering a practical low-cost and highly reliable security detection solution for edge nodes in large-scale IoT systems.

The fluid antenna system (FAS) is a disruptive tech-nology for future wireless communication networks. This paper considers the joint optimization of beamforming matrices and antenna positions for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization in fluid antenna (FA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks, which presents significant chal-lenges due to the strong coupling between beamforming and FA positions, the non-concavity of the WSR objective function, and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method that employs matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we develop a parallel majorization maximization (MM) algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simul-taneously. To further reduce computational costs, we propose a decentralized implementation based on the decentralized base-band processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demon-strate that our proposed algorithm not only achieves significant WSR improvements over conventional MIMO networks but also outperforms the existing method. Moreover, the decentralized implementation substantially reduces computation time while maintaining similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.

Occlusion-Aware Consistent Model Predictive Control for Robot Navigation in Occluded Obstacle-Dense Environments

Ensuring safety and motion consistency for robot navigation in occluded, obstacle-dense environments is a critical challenge. In this context, this study presents an occlusion-aware Consistent Model Predictive Control (CMPC) strategy. To account for the occluded obstacles, it incorporates adjustable risk regions that represent their potential future locations. Subsequently, dynamic risk boundary constraints are developed online to ensure this http URL CMPC then constructs multiple locally optimal trajectory branches (each tailored to different risk regions) to strike a balance between safety and performance. A shared consensus segment is generated to ensure smooth transitions between branches without significant velocity fluctuations, further preserving motion consistency. To facilitate high computational efficiency and ensure coordination across local trajectories, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the CMPC into manageable sub-problems for parallel solving. The proposed strategy is validated through simulations and real-world experiments on an Ackermann-steering robot platform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMPC strategy through comparisons with baseline approaches in occluded, obstacle-dense environments.

Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety, allowing, for instance, safe navigation in operational space under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation, which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in the Karhunen-Loève domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on the design of space-time codewords.

Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS)
In recent years, there has been a growing focus on fairness and inclusivity within speech technology, particularly in areas such as automatic speech recognition and speech sentiment analysis. When audio is transcoded prior to processing, as is the case in streaming or real-time applications, any inherent bias in the coding mechanism may result in disparities. This not only affects user experience but can also have broader societal implications by perpetuating stereotypes and exclusion. Thus, it is important that audio coding mechanisms are unbiased. In this work, we contribute towards the scarce research with respect to language and gender biases of audio codecs. By analyzing the speech quality of over 2 million multilingual audio files after transcoding through a representative subset of codecs (PSTN, VoIP and neural), our results indicate that PSTN codecs are strongly biased in terms of gender and that neural codecs introduce language biases.

Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are widely regarded as a cornerstone of the emerging low-altitude economy, yet they face significant challenges, including rapidly varying channels, diverse functional requirements, and dynamic interference environments. Fluid antenna (FA) systems introduce spatial reconfigurability that complements and extends conventional beamforming, enabling flexible exploitation of spatial diversity and adaptive response to channel variations. This paper proposes a novel architecture for FA-empowered LAWNs and presents a case study demonstrating substantial improvements in communication, sensing, and control performance compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Key practical deployment considerations are examined, including mechanical design, position control, energy efficiency, and compliance with emerging industry standards. In addition, several future research directions are highlighted, including intelligent optimization, multi-function integration, and the exploration of novel low-altitude applications. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical deployment perspectives, this paper establishes FA systems as a key enabler for adaptive, efficient, and resilient network infrastructures in next-generation LAWNs.

Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

Speech foundation models (SFMs) are increasingly hailed as powerful computational models of human speech perception. However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SFMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying electrocorticography (ECoG) response variance shared between feature classes. Variance-partitioning analyses revealed several key insights: First, the SFMs' alignment with the brain can be mostly explained by their ability to learn and encode simple interpretable speech features. Second, SFMs exhibit a systematic trade-off between encoding of brain-relevant low-level and high-level features across layers. Finally, our results show that SFMs learn brain-relevant semantics which cannot be explained by lower-level speech features, with this capacity increasing with model size and context length. Together, our findings suggest a principled approach to build more interpretable, accurate, and efficient encoding models of the brain by augmenting SFM embeddings with interpretable features.

Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.

In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) enable us to generate minimum distance collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver. We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static, as well as globally optimal trajectories in cluttered dynamic environments.

Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

This report introduces Canary-1B-v2, a fast, robust multilingual model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech-to-Text Translation (AST). Built with a FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder, it supports 25 languages primarily European. The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples, including Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce hallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an nGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while FastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable segment-level timestamps for ASR and AST. Evaluations show Canary-1B-v2 outperforms Whisper-large-v3 on English ASR while being 10x faster, and delivers competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against larger models like Seamless-M4T-v2-large and LLM-based systems. We also release Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3, a successor to v2, offering multilingual ASR across the same 25 languages with just 600M parameters.

A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.

Title:
Speech Language Models for Under-Represented Languages: Insights from Wolof

We present our journey in training a speech language model for Wolof, an underrepresented language spoken in West Africa, and share key insights. We first emphasize the importance of collecting large-scale, spontaneous, high-quality unsupervised speech data, and show that continued pretraining HuBERT on this dataset outperforms both the base model and African-centric models on ASR. We then integrate this speech encoder into a Wolof LLM to train the first Speech LLM for this language, extending its capabilities to tasks such as speech translation. Furthermore, we explore training the Speech LLM to perform multi-step Chain-of-Thought before transcribing or translating. Our results show that the Speech LLM not only improves speech recognition but also performs well in speech translation. The models and the code will be openly shared.

Mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems excel at transcribing lexical content, but largely fail to recognize nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) embedded in speech, such as sighs, laughs, and coughs. This capability is important for a comprehensive understanding of human communication, as NVs convey crucial emotional and intentional cues. Progress in NV-aware ASR has been hindered by the lack of high-quality, well-annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MNV-17, a 7.55-hour performative Mandarin speech dataset. Unlike most existing corpora that rely on model-based detection, MNV-17's performative nature ensures high-fidelity, clearly articulated NV instances. To the best of our knowledge, MNV-17 provides the most extensive set of nonverbal vocalization categories, comprising 17 distinct and well-balanced classes of common NVs. We benchmarked MNV-17 on four mainstream ASR architectures, evaluating their joint performance on semantic transcription and NV classification. The dataset and the pretrained model checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in expressive ASR.
