Title:
Counting Degrees of Freedom: A Method Applicable from Scalars to f(Q) Gravity and Beyond
Lavinia Heisenberg
Comments:
130 pages, 5 figures. Any comments are welcome
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We present a clear, step-by-step method for counting degrees of freedom and identifying constraints in general field theories. This approach, grounded in the works of Einstein, Hilbert, Cartan, Kuranishi, and, more recently, Seiler, is neither Lagrangian nor Hamiltonian in nature. Instead, it applies directly to the field equations. We offer a transparent physical interpretation of the method, establish new results, and explore a broad set of examples to demonstrate its power and generality. Notably, we apply the method to $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where traditional techniques such as the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm are ineffective, and obtain seven propagating degrees of freedom.

Title:
On the uniqueness of the discrete Calderon problem on multi-dimensional lattices
Maolin Deng, Bangti Jin
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we investigate the discrete Calderón problem on grid graphs of dimension three or higher, formed by hypercubic structures. The discrete Calderón problem is concerned with determining whether the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator, which links boundary potentials to boundary current responses, can uniquely identify the conductivity values on the graph edges. We provide an affirmative answer to the question, thereby extending the classical uniqueness result of Curtis and Morrow for two-dimensional square lattices. The proof employs a novel slicing technique that decomposes the problem into lower-dimensional components. Additionally, we support the theoretical finding with numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Perfect t-Embeddings of Uniformly Weighted Generalized Tower Graphs
David Keating, Hieu Trung Vu
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
In this paper, we study sequences of perfect t-embeddings of a uniformly weighted family of graphs we call generalized tower graphs. We show that the embeddings of these graphs satisfy certain technical assumptions, in particular, the rigidity assumption of Berggren-Nicoletti-Russkikh. As a result, we confirm the convergence of the gradients of the height function fluctuations of these graphs to those of the Gaussian free field.

Short, Quantitative Construction of the IIC in Planar Percolation
Malo Hillairet (IF)
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
It is standard to construct the Infinite Incipient Cluster as the limit of the critical percolation measure conditioned on 0 being connected to radius n, as n tends to infinity. We provide a short proof of that convergence in the planar setting. A key step in the proof is to introduce an unbiased percolation configuration above which are coupled two percolations conditioned on 0 being connected to different radii. It implies a speed of convergence in total variation distance to the IIC measure upper-bounded by the dual one-arm probability, which is the first occurrence of an explicit upperbound.

Title:
Approximating Quantum States with Positive Partial Transposes in Multipartite System via Linearized Proximal Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Numerical approximation of quantum states via convex combinations of states with positive partial transposes (bi-PPT state) in multipartite systems constitutes a fundamental challenge in quantum information science. We reformulate this problem as a linearly constrained optimization problem. An approximate model is constructed through an auxiliary variable and a suitable penalty parameter, balancing constraint violation and approximation error. To slove the approximate model, we design a Linearized Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (LPADMM), proving its convergence under a prescribed inequality condition on regularization parameters. The algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for attaining $\epsilon$-stationary solutions. Numerical validation on diverse quantum systems, including three-qubit W/GHZ states and five-partite GHZ and multiGHZ states with noises, confirms high-quality bi-PPT approximations and decomposability certification, demonstrating the utility of our method for quantum information applications.

Quantum quenches with long range interactions

We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.

We consider the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation in three spatial dimensions with powers close to three and prove the existence of a self-similar solution. This generalizes a previous result on the cubic case and shows that self-similar blowup is stable under perturbations of the equation.

Towards the Parametric Renormalization of the S-matrix - I
Pinaki Banerjee, Harsh, Alok Laddha

Subjects:

Zimmermann's forest formula is the corner stone of perturbative renormalization in QFT. By renormalizing individual Feynman graphs, it generates the UV finite S-matrix. This approach to renormalization makes the graph and all its forests center pieces in the theory of renormalization. On the other hand the positive geometry program delegate the role of Feynman graphs as secondary to the amplitude itself, which are generated by canonical forms associated to positive geometries. State of the art in this program is the convergence of S-matrix theory in local QFTs and string theory as the scattering amplitudes in QFT arise as integrals over certain moduli spaces. These integrals are known as curve integrals. For theories such as $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ theory with massive colored scalars, these integrals are divergent in the UV and have to be regularized. It is then natural to ask if there is a ``forest-like formula'' for these integrals which produce a renormalized amplitude without needing to explicitly invoke the forests associated to divergent subgraphs. In this paper, we initiate such a program by deriving forest-like formula for planar massive $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ amplitudes in $D = 4$ dimensions. Our analysis relies on the insightful manifestation of the forest formula derived by Brown and Kreimer in \cite{Brown:2011pj}, that lead us to a definition of ``tropical counter-term'' for the bare amplitude.

Title:
Cardy limit of the 3d superconformal index
Arash Arabi Ardehali, Mathieu Boisvert, Shehab Hossam Fadda
Comments:
5 figures, a 12-page summary in the introduction section
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We study the superconformal index $Z(q)$ of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories in Cardy-like limits $\beta = \log \tfrac{1}{q} \to 0^+$, extending techniques recently developed in the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ context. For theories with vectorlike matter content we find on the first sheet ($q \to 1$) that $Z(q) \sim \beta^{-\#}$, where the exponent $\#$ is determined by a $multiscale\ decomposition$ of the BPS moduli space appearing in the localization formula for the index. On the second sheet ($q \to e^{2\pi i})$ we find $Z(q) \sim e^{\#/ \beta}$, and that the long-standing puzzle of apparent gauge-enhancing saddles is resolved (in the absence of Chern--Simons couplings) via a novel $Lorentzian\ factorization$ formula that establishes complete screening.
A key insight is the use of $Poisson\ resummation$, which streamlines the asymptotic analysis, sharpens the link to Kaluza--Klein effective field theory, and provides a dual description of parts of the BPS moduli space in terms of punctured surfaces. The Lorentzian factorization formula also emerges from Poisson resummation, though applied after a contour crossing in moduli space. This, in turn, hints at a correspondence between 3d monopoles and vortices via 2d duality.

Title:
A sharper Magnus expansion bound woven in binary branches
Harriet Apel, Toby Cubitt, Emilio Onorati
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The Magnus expansion provides an exponential representation of one-parameter operator families, expressed as a series expansion in its generators. This is useful for example in quantum mechanics for expressing a unitary evolution determined by a time-dependent Hamiltonian generator of the dynamics. The solution is constructed as a series expansion in terms of increasingly complex nested commutators that rapidly become challenging to compute directly. This work establishes a universal upper bound, agnostic to the generator, on the error incurred when the Magnus expansion is truncated at an arbitrary given order. The main technical ingredient of the proof is the binary tree representation introduced by Iserles and Norsett from which we derive a recursion formula to delimit the magnitude of any term in the expansion. We complement our analytic results for the truncation error with explicit calculation of the first 24 terms in the Magnus series, illustrating that they follow the scaling behaviour we have derived. With these findings we aim to contribute to the understanding of the accuracy and limitations of the Magnus expansion technique, and to provide a sharper bound for approximating quantum dynamics without requiring assumptions on the structure of their generators.

ff-bifbox: A scalable, open-source toolbox for bifurcation analysis of nonlinear PDEs
Christopher M. Douglas, Pierre Jolivet
Comments:
19 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Nonlinear PDEs give rise to complex dynamics that are often difficult to analyze in state space due to their relatively large numbers of degrees of freedom, ill-conditioned operators, and changing spatial and parameter resolution requirements. This work introduces ff-bifbox: a new open-source toolbox for performing numerical branch tracing, stability/bifurcation analysis, resolvent analysis, and time integration of large, time-dependent nonlinear PDEs discretized on adaptively refined meshes in two and three spatial dimensions. Spatial discretization is handled using finite elements in FreeFEM, with the discretized operators manipulated in a distributed framework via PETSc. Following a summary of the underlying theory and numerics, results from three examples are presented to validate the implementation and demonstrate its capabilities. The considered examples, which are provided with runnable ff-bifbox code, include: a 3-D Brusselator system, a 3-D plate buckling system, and a 2-D compressible Navier--Stokes system. In addition to reproducing results from prior studies, novel results are presented for each system.

Lipschitz Continuity and Formulas of the Gradient Vector of the SRB Entropy Functional
Jianyu Chen, Miaohua Jiang
Comments:

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The Sobolev embedding theorem implies that the SRB entropy functional is also differentiable in the family of Anosov diffeomorphisms equipped with a suitable Hilbert manifold structure. The same holds true for the SRB entropy functional over the family of smooth expanding maps on a closed Riemannian manifold. This implication leads to the local existence of the gradient flow of the SRB entropy and an explicit formula for the gradient vector of the entropy functional via the linear response of the SRB measure.

Title:
A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids
Christian Tantardini
Subjects:
Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Conventional diagnostics of Weyl points -- Berry flux on small spheres and $k \cdot p$ linearization -- are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center and radius, gauge smoothing, charting, and local frame transport) that introduce algorithmic arbitrariness in first-principles workflows. We propose a \emph{local, basis-free} criterion built from the octonionic structure on $\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we construct a unit octonion field and its octonionic connection; contracting three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$--invariant three-form yields a pseudoscalar density whose sign equals the Weyl chirality. A vanishing octonionic associator at leading order certifies that the local problem closes inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane, while a nonzero density identifies a Weyl point. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge-seam choices. In the linear regime we prove equivalence with the conventional diagnostics (Chern charge on a small sphere and $\mathrm{sgn}\det v$). We outline a practical algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and provide self-consistency checks based on stencil refinement and the associator norm. The \emph{octonionic Weyl point criterion} streamlines chirality assignment in high-throughput searches and offers an intrinsic warning signal in the presence of band entanglement or proximity to multi-fold touchings.

Overcoming limitations on gate fidelity in noisy static exchange-coupled surface qubits
Hoang-Anh Le, Saba Taherpour, Denis Janković, Christoph Wolf
Subjects:

Recent experiments demonstrated that the spin state of individual atoms on surfaces can be quantum-coherently controlled through all-electric electron spin resonance. By constructing interacting arrays of atoms this results in an atomic-scale qubit platform. However, the static exchange coupling between qubits, limited lifetime and polarization of the initial state, impose significant limits on high-fidelity quantum control. We address this issue using open quantum systems simulation and quantum optimal control theory. We demonstrate the conditions under which high-fidelity operations ($\mathcal{F} \gtrsim 0.9$) are feasible in this qubit platform, and show how the Krotov method of quantum optimal control theory adapts to specific noise sources to outperform the conventional Rabi drivings. Finally, we re-examine the experimental setup used in the initial demonstration of this qubit platform and propose optimized experimental designs to maximize gate fidelity in this platform.

An explicit formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the Stiefel manifold
Petre Birtea, Ioan Casu, Dan Comanescu
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive an explicit formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the orthogonal Stiefel manifold, viewed as a constraint submanifold of the Euclidean space of real matrices equipped with the Frobenius metric. Using the general framework of Laplace operators on constraint manifolds, we provide the formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the ambient Euclidean coordinates. The result extends previously known cases, recovering the formulas for the sphere and the special orthogonal group as particular instances.

We show that, in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity without matter fields, the Schwinger-Dyson equations derived within the Hamiltonian framework of non-critical string field theory can be reformulated in terms of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion, and we explicitly compute the associated low-order amplitudes. In particular, we establish this reformulation for two discrete models -- the basic type and the strip type -- as well as for the continuum limit of dynamical triangulations.

A general action for a particle in 2+1 anti-de Sitter space

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We discuss a general action for a particle in AdS$_3$ using the non-linear realization framework. Critical sectors are found and characterized in terms of the parameters appearing in the Lagrangian, generalizing the known results for AdS$_3$/SO(2). A study of the dynamics of this system and of the geometrical meaning of the new terms in the action is also undertaken.
Using two chiral copies of the general AdS$_2$ Lagrangian, we obtain an AdS$_3$ Lagrangian which is the same, although expressed in different variables, that the general AdS$_3$ one, and from this one can identify the extra gauge transformations appearing in the critical sectors of the AdS$_3$ theory. A differential equation connecting the AdS$_2 \times$ AdS$_2$ chiral variables to the AdS$_3$ covariant ones is obtained, and it is explicitly solved at first order in the Goldstone bosons associated to boosts and rotations.

In this paper, we present a generalization of the Gell-Mann--Nishijima formula for the assignment of electric charges to the components of an arbitrary-dimensional multiplet which transforms under general gauge symmetries, regardless of whether these multiplets couple to particles with known charge. The method is valid for local or global unitary symmetries and works for theories with or without spontaneous or explicit symmetry breaking. We extend the method for other conserved charges as flavors (horizontal symmetries) and color (QCD).

Correlation decay for U(1) lattice Higgs theory: the case of small mass
Sourav Chatterjee, Oren Yakir
Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs model with inverse gauge coupling $\beta>0$ and Higgs length $\alpha>0$, in the ``complete breakdown of symmetry" regime. For lattice dimension $d\ge 2$ and (abelian) gauge group U(1), we prove that for any $m>0$, if $\alpha= m\beta$ and $\beta$ is large enough, the model exhibits exponential decay of correlations. This extends the classical result of Osterwalder and Seiler (1978), who required in addition that $m$ be sufficiently large. Our result also verifies a phase diagram from the physics literature, predicted by Fradkin and Shenker (1979). The proof is based on the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster expansion around a massive Gaussian field, following the approach of Balaban et al. (1984).

This thesis explores the correspondence between Chern-Simons theory and integrable field theories across different dimensions. It brings together all of my work in this area, including several distinct realizations of this correspondence. The thesis generalizes existing results on four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space. Additionally, it presents the discovery of a novel correspondence between five-dimensional holomorphic 2-Chern-Simons theory and integrable field theories in three dimensions.

Conifold gap and all-genus mirror symmetry for local $\mathbb{P}^2$
Andrea Brini

Subjects:

The Conifold Gap Conjecture asserts that the polar part of the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau threefold near its conifold locus has a universal expression described by the logarithm of the Barnes $G$-function. In this paper, I prove the Conifold Gap Conjecture for the local projective plane. The proof relates the higher genus conifold Gromov-Witten generating series of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ to the thermodynamics of a certain statistical mechanical ensemble of repulsive particles on the positive half-line. As a corollary, this establishes the all-genus mirror principle for local $\mathbb{P}^2$ through the direct integration of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations.

Structural transitions in interacting lattice systems

Analysis and Mathematical Physics 14(27), 2024
Subjects:

We consider two-dimensional systems of point particles located on rectangular lattices and interacting via pairwise potentials. The goal of this paper is to investigate the phase transitions (and their nature) at fixed density for the minimal energy of such systems. The 2D rectangle lattices we consider have an elementary cell of sides $a$ and $b$, the aspect ratio is defined as $\Delta=b/a$ and the inverse particle density $A = a b$; therefore, the ``symmetric'' state with $\Delta=1$ corresponds to the square lattice and the ``non-symmetric'' state to the rectangular lattice with $\Delta\ne 1$. For certain types of the interaction potential, by changing continuously the particle density, such lattice systems undertake at a specific value of the (inverse) particle density $A^*$ a structural transition from the symmetric to the non-symmetric state. The structural transition can be either of first order ($\Delta$ unstick from its symmetric value $\Delta=1$ discontinuously) or of second order ($\Delta$ unstick from $\Delta=1$ continuously); the first and second-order phase transitions are separated by the so-called tricritical point. We develop a general theory on how to determine the exact values of the transition densities and the location of the tricritical point. The general theory is applied to the double Yukawa and Yukawa-Coulomb potentials.

We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $4d$ $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) half Seiberg--Witten spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hslash$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Doł{ę}ga--Osuga.

Equidistant versus bipartite ground states for 1D classical fluids at fixed particle density

Analysis and Mathematical Physics 15(88), 2025

Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the ground-state properties of one-dimensional fluids of classical (i.e., non-quantum) particles interacting pairwisely via a potential, at the fixed particle density $\rho$. Restricting ourselves to periodic configurations of particles, two possibilities are considered: an equidistant chain of particles with the uniform spacing $A=1/\rho$ and its simplest non-Bravais modulation, namely a bipartite lattice composed of two equidistant chains, shifted with respect to one another. Assuming the long range of the interaction potential, the equidistant chain dominates if $A$ is small enough, $0<A<A_c$. At a critical value of $A=A_c$, the system undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition from the equidistant chain to a bipartite lattice. The energy and the order parameter are singular functions of the deviation from the critical point $A-A_c$ with universal (i.e., independent of the model's parameters) mean-field values of critical exponents. The tricritical point at which the curve of continuous second-order transitions meets with the one of discontinuous first-order transitions is determined. The general theory is applied to the Lennard-Jones model with the $(n,m)$ Mie potential for which the phase diagram is constructed. The inclusion of a hard-core around each particle reveals a non-universal critical phenomenon with an $m$-dependent critical exponent.

Thermal boundary conditions in fractional superdiffusion of energy
Tomasz Komorowski, Stefano Olla
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study heat conduction in a one-dimensional finite,
unpinned chain of atoms perturbed by stochastic momentum exchange and coupled to Langevin
heat baths at possibly distinct temperatures placed at the
endpoints of the chain. While infinite systems without boundaries are known to exhibit
superdiffusive energy transport described by a fractional heat
equation with the generator $-|\Delta|^{3/4}$, the corresponding boundary conditions induced by heat baths
remain less understood. We establish the hydrodynamic limit for a finite chain with $n+1$
atoms connected to thermostats at the endpoints, deriving the macroscopic evolution of the averaged energy profile.
The limiting equation is governed by a non-local Lévy-type operator, with boundary terms determined by explicit interaction kernels
that encode absorption, reflection, and transmission of long-wavelength
phonons at the baths. Our results provide the first rigorous identification
of boundary conditions for fractional superdiffusion arising directly
from microscopic dynamics, highlighting their distinction from both diffusive and pinned-chain settings.

Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants

We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.

We provide a class of examples of interacting particle systems on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d\in\{1,2\}$, that admit a unique translation-invariant stationary measure, which is not the long-time limit of all translation-invariant starting measures, due to the existence of time-periodic orbits in the associated measure-valued dynamics. This is the first such example and shows that even in low dimensions, not every limit point of the measure-valued dynamics needs to be a time-stationary measure.

Title:
Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system
Bryn Davies
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We show that the statistics of a chaotic system can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators and computing their densities of states. For such operators, the density of states is well understood and can be computed straightforwardly, often yielding explicit formulas. As a case study, we investigate a nonlinear recursion relation that maps naturally onto a family of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This correspondence enables us to derive an explicit formula for the limiting statistics of the chaotic system and to demonstrate that the clustering near to critical values is equivalent to the van Hove singularities in the operators' densities of states.

The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.

Average Degree of Graphs Derived From The Ammann A2 Aperiodic Tiling

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The Ammann A2 tiling is a simple aperiodically ordered tiling of the plane. We consider the graph derived from this tiling, by treating each corner of each tile as a vertex and each side of each tile as an edge. We present a closed-form formula for the average degree of the graph corresponding to this Ammann A2 tiling.

We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.

Microcanonical Phase Space and Entropy in Curved Spacetime

We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. Under certain physically reasonable assumptions that ensure the existence of such ensembles, we derive two generic characteristics of the leading curvature corrections: (1) they are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and (2) their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We also obtain exact analytical results for microcanonical ensembles in de Sitter spacetime, which reproduce the perturbative results in the limit $\Lambda \to 0$, but have interesting limits when the size of the system is comparable to ${\Lambda}^{-1/2}$. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry, and illustrate this by comparing and contrasting the results for (i) geodesic box in de Sitter, (ii) geodesic box in Schwarzschild, and (iii) uniformly accelerated box in Minkowski. Finally, we extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.

Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds

We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a Kähler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous Kähler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous Kähler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.

Title:
Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes

Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation requires overcoming the Eastin--Knill theorem on quantum error correction (QEC) codes that protect information from noise. This is often accomplished through strategies like magic state distillation, which prepares computational resources -- namely, magic states -- whose power is rooted in quantum contextuality, a fundamental nonclassical feature generalizing Bell nonlocality. Yet, the broader role of contextuality in enabling universality, including its significance as an inherent feature of QEC codes and protocols themselves, has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a rigorous framework for contextuality in QEC and prove three main results. Fundamentally, we show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual in their partial closure, while others are noncontextual, establishing a clear criterion for identifying contextual codes. Mathematically, we unify Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic and Kirby--Love's tree-based definitions of contextuality, resolving a conjecture of Kim and Abramsky. Practically, we prove that many widely studied code-switching protocols which admit universal transversal gate sets, such as the doubled color codes introduced by Bravyi and Cross, are necessarily strongly contextual in their partial closure. Collectively, our results establish quantum contextuality as an intrinsic characteristic of fault-tolerant quantum codes and protocols, complementing entanglement and magic as resources for scalable quantum computation. For quantum coding theorists, this provides a new invariant: contextuality classifies which subsystem stabilizer codes can participate in universal fault-tolerant protocols. These findings position contextuality not only as a foundational concept but also as a practical guide for the design and analysis of future QEC architectures.

SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups

Comments:

We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.

Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

We introduce Poisson $C^\infty$-rings and Poisson local $C^\infty$-ringed spaces. We show that the spectrum of a Poisson $C^\infty$-ring is an affine Poisson $C^\infty$-scheme. We then discuss applications that include singular symplectic and Poisson reductions, singular quasi-Poisson reduction, coisotropic reduction and Poisson-Dirac subschemes.

Quantitative gap universality for Wigner matrices
Albert Zhang
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We obtain the explicit rate of convergence $N^{-1/2 + \epsilon}$ for the gaps of generalized Wigner matrices in the bulk of the spectrum, for distributions of matrix entries possibly atomic and supported on enough points. The proof proceeds by a Green function comparison, coupled with the relaxation estimate from [5]. In particular, we extend the 4 moment matching method [33] to arbitrary moments, allowing to compare resolvents down to the submicroscopic scale $N^{-3/2 + \epsilon}$. This method also gives universality of the smallest gaps between eigenvalues for the Hermitian symmetry class, providing a universal, optimal separation of eigenvalues for discrete random matrices with entries supported on $\Omega(1)$ points.

We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model
Wenjie Ye, Rongchan Zhu
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In this paper, we prove that the large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model is given by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) in both finite and infinite volumes. We establish uniform in $N$ bounds for the dynamics, which enable us to demonstrate convergence to the mean-field SDE with polynomial interactions. Furthermore, the mean-field SDE is shown to be globally well-posed for suitable initial distributions. We also prove the existence of stationary measures for the mean-field SDE. For small inverse temperatures, we characterize the large $N$ limit of the spin $O(N)$ model through stationary coupling. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of the stationary measure for the mean-field SDE.

Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere
Mingyang Han, Chunqin Zhou
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.
