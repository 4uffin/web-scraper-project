Title:
p-adic dynamical systems for $p$-adic $λ$-models on the Cayley trees
Farrukh Mukhamedov, Otabek Khakimov
Comments:
23 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We review and propose to use of associated dynamical system to explore the phase transition phenomena in $p$-adic statistical mechanics setting, by means of the renormalization techniques. Main focus of the paper is the $p$-adic $\lambda$-model on the Cayley tree. We study generalized $p$-adic quasi Gibbs measures for the $\lambda$-model. These measures associate recurrence equations that determine dynamical systems for the model. A main point is to verify and confirm that the indicated predictions from a dynamical system point of view are indeed true.

Integration on $q$-Cosymplectic Manifolds
M. Leok, C. Sardón, X. Zhao
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper presents a unified framework for studying dynamics and integration on $q$-cosymplectic manifolds. After outlining the geometric foundations of $q$-cosymplectic structures, we derive new results concerning integrable systems and the characterization of Liouville coordinates, and further investigate the Lie integrability of $q$-evolution systems in this setting. We then develop a Hamilton--Jacobi theory tailored to multi-time Hamiltonian systems, both from an intrinsic geometric perspective and via symplectification techniques. To illustrate the applicability of the framework, we construct a $q$-cosymplectic Hamiltonian model for an extended FitzHugh-Nagumo system, providing a biologically relevant example involving three distinct temporal scales.

Subjects:

Motivated by Open Problem 17 in Damanik-Fillman's manuscript , we study the decay rate of limit-periodic approximation such that ballistic transport persists in the limit-periodic setting. We show an exponential decay rate, roughly $\|\mathscr{J}-\mathscr{J}_{q_n}\|\sim e^{-\eta q_n}$, is sufficient. This improves on earlier results of Fillman arXiv:1603.01173

Green's functions for magnetic Dirac operators and bulk-edge correspondence

We study the resolvent kernel (Green's function) of magnetic Dirac operators on a half-plane with boundary conditions interpolating between infinite mass and zigzag cases, excluding the latter. We show that these kernels have all the required properties so that the proof of bulk-edge correspondence from the infinite mass case shown recently can be repeated ad litteram. The zigzag case exhibits qualitatively different behavior and will be addressed in future work.

Title:
Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis versus Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture: a comparison
Hans A. Weidenmüller
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Thermalization of a closed chaotic quantum system is commonly addressed in terms of the eigenstate ther- malization hypothesis (ETH). An alternative approach uses the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture. The comparison shows that the two approaches differ significantly. In contrast to ETH, BGS fully uses the statistical properies of the chaotic Hamiltonian. In both approaches, the criterion for thermalization is similar. BGS goes beyond ETH in predicting quantitatively the time dependence of thermalization.

In these lecture notes, we present, contextualize, and discuss the phenomenon of metastability (or prethermalization) in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and similar models from the viewpoint of perturbation theory. We provide an updated state-of-the-art description of this intermediate state in terms of the underlying integrable dynamics, in particular the Korteweg-de Vries and inviscid Burgers equations.

Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This book is devoted to an informal discussion of patterns constructed for treating physical problems. Such patterns, when sufficiently formalized, are usually referred as "models", and tents to be applied not only in physics, but conquer the fields traditionally occupied by other disciplines generally considered to be different from physics. The author calls this unification of seemingly disjoint results a "physmatical effect" - pointing to the fact that multitudes of fine - grained physics-based mathematical models become inextricably linked and networked. Mathematics serves as a key code gluing together isolated physical models viewed as nodes of this network.

Hypergeometry from $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-Symmetry: Feynman Integrals in One and Two Dimensions
Gwenaël Ferrando, Florian Loebbert, Amelie Pitters, Sven F. Stawinski
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Feynman integrals with generic propagator powers in one and two spacetime dimensions are investigated from various perspectives. In particular, we argue that the class of track integrals at any loop order is fixed by the recently found $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of Yangian type. All track integrals up to six external points (and four loops) are bootstrapped explicitly as well as the full family of one-loop integrals at any multiplicity. Moreover, the triangle tracks at generic loop order, which constitute the most generic family of track-type integrals, are bootstrapped in this way. The results are compared to the direct evaluation via a `spectral transform' from the integrability toolbox that turns out to be particularly efficient for position-space tree integrals in lower dimensions. We prove that all $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of these integrals can be derived from the framework of Aomoto--Gelfand hypergeometric functions, which applies to integrals in one and two dimensions. Finally, we also demonstrate the method's applicability to conformal integrals by deriving the complete results for all comb-channel conformal partial waves as well as the conformal double-box integral. We explicitly go through all examples of the above integrals in 1D and then provide a straightforward recipe for how to read off their 2D counterparts.

Bilinear Differential-Difference Equations and One-Point Distributions of Some KPZ-Class Models
C. Alexander Rodriguez
Comments:
36 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We introduce a collection of nonlinear integrable partial differential-difference equations that are satisfied by the one-point distribution functions of some classical integrable KPZ models. Moreover, these equations can be regarded as reparametrizations or as scaling limits of the Hirota bilinear difference equation (HBDE), a canonical discretization for many important integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, and the two-dimensional Toda lattice (2DTL). Our contributions are threefold: (i) general Fredholm determinant solutions; (ii) verification that known formulas for classical integrable KPZ models fit within our framework; and (iii) zero-curvature/Lax pair formulations. As an application, we derive formal scaling limits of the equations, including the KP limit under 1:2:3 KPZ scaling.

Unital Kadison-Schwarz Maps
Hajir Al Zadjali, Farrukh Mukhamedov
Journal-ref:
Open Syst. & Inform. Dyn. 32(2025), 2550007
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Quantum entanglement is an important phenomenon in quantum information theory. To detect entanglement theoretically, positive but not completely positive maps are used. The Kadison-Schwarz (KS) inequality interpolates between positivity and complete positivity. KS maps may be key to understanding and detecting entanglement. We provide a description of a subset of KS maps on $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ that are unital. This allows for the classification of a wider class of positive maps than the well known bistochastic maps. We derive the conditions for a unital map to be a KS map, and provide non-trivial examples of such a map.

Non-isentropic cavity flow for the multi-d compressible Euler system
Helge Kristian Jenssen, Charis Tsikkou
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We rigorously construct non-isentropic and self-similar multi-d Euler flows in which a central cavity (vacuum region) collapses. While isentropic flows of this type have been analyzed earlier by Hunter \cite{hun_60} and others, the non-isentropic setting introduces additional complications, in particular with respect to the behavior along the fluid-vacuum interface. The flows we construct satisfy the physical boundary conditions: the interface is a material surface along which the pressure vanishes, and it propagates with a non-vanishing and finite acceleration until collapse.
We introduce a number of algebraic conditions on the parameters in the problem (spatial dimension, adiabatic index, similarity parameters). With these conditions satisfied, a simple argument based on trapping regions for the associated similarity ODEs yields the existence of non-isentropic cavity flows. We finally verify that the conditions are all met for several physically relevant cases in both two and three dimensions.

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In the present paper, we study quantum Sobolev spaces whose elements are operators of the Hilbert-Schmidt class. We construct these Sobolev spaces from the Fourier transform for operators. Next, we obtain continuous embedding theorems. Finally, we delve into solving partial differential equations where the unknown is an operator. The results have potential applications in quantum physics, providing a new theoretical basis for relevant research.

Quantum Algorithms for Solving Generalized Linear Systems via Momentum Accelerated Gradient and Schrödingerization
Qitong Hu, Xiaoyang He, Shi Jin, Xiao-Dong Zhang
Comments:
30 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that combines the momentum accelerated gradient method with Schrödingerization [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], achieving polynomial speedup over its classical counterpark in solving linear systems. The algorithm achieves a query complexity of the same order as the Schrödingerization based damped dynamical system method, namely, linear dependence on the condition number of the matrix, and can overcome the practical limitations of existing non-Schrödingerization-based quantum linear system algorithms. These limitations stem from their reliance on techniques such as VTAA and RM, which introduce substantial quantum hardware resource overhead. Furthermore, it demonstrates both theoretically and experimentally that the auxiliary variables introduced by our method do not dominate the error reduction at any point, thereby preventing a significant increase in the actual evolution time compared to the theoretical prediction. In contrast, the damped method fails to meet this criterion. This gives new perspectives for quantum algorithms for linear systems, establishing a novel analytical framework for algorithms with broader applicability, faster convergence rates, and superior solution quality.

Invertible projective 2-representations from invertible 2d TQFTs with defects
Domenico Fiorenza, Chetan Vuppulury
Comments:

Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We investigate invertible projective representations and their 2-categorical analogues using the language of TQFTs with defects. The main result is a freeness property for invertible projective representatios. While trivial in the 1-categorical setting, this result becomes interesting for 2-representations: as an application, only relying only on invertibility of Clifford algebras and Fock bimodules in the Morita 2-category of super vector spaces we recover Ludewig--Roos' result that the Clifford/Fock construction is a projective 2-representation of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.

Compactness and least energy solutions to the Super-Liouville equation on the Sphere
Mingyang Han, Chunqin Zhou
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.

Dynamics of Interacting Murnaghan-Equation-of-State Fluids with Global Monopole and Nonlinear Power-Yang-Mills Hair in Critical-Dimension AdS Black Holes

Subjects:

We construct and analyze a novel family of exact higher-dimensional black hole solutions in Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field multiplet supporting a global monopole and a surrounding anisotropic ''scalar gas'' whose stress-energy obeys a generalized Murnaghan equation of state. By adopting the Wu-Yang magnetic ansatz for the non-Abelian sector and enforcing the physically motivated radial condition $p_r=-\rho$, the field equations admit closed-form expressions for the matter density and a single-function lapse $F(r)$ expressed in terms of elementary and Gauss hypergeometric functions. The Murnaghan fluid interpolates between a non-linear core and an effective vacuum at a large radius, producing a backreaction encoded by parameters that control the stiffness and scalar-backreaction scale. We perform a systematic survey of classical energy condition, identifying regions of parameter space where the null energy condition/dominant energy condition holds while the strong energy condition is generically violated (phantom-like behavior), and examine curvature invariants to demonstrate that the solutions possess a central curvature singularity for $n>3$. Thermodynamic properties are derived in the extended phase space: explicit formulas for the Hawking temperature, entropy, conjugate potentials, and a generalized Smarr relation are obtained; the heat capacity exhibits divergencies and sign changes that mark local stability boundaries and second-order phase transitions. Varying the Yang-Mills charge, the nonlinearity index, the monopole coupling, and the Murnaghan parameters generates a rich phase behavior structure and topology changes in the defect ($\varphi$-Duan) map. The results underscore the manner in which gauge nonlinearity, topological defects, and dual-polytropic matter collaboratively transform BH thermodynamics and the topology of phase spaces.

Unravelling the Holomorphic Twist II: Anomalies and Extended Supersymmetry

Comments:
48 pages + appendices. Comments welcome!
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
Twists of four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories (SQFTs) isolate protected sectors with rich algebraic structures. We develop a unified framework for analyzing symmetries and anomalies in four-dimensional holomorphically twisted SQFTs, combiningcomplex-geometric and algebraic perspectives. This approach clarifies the connections between existing formulations in the literature and resolves several open questions left unanswered in the first installment of this series.
We place particular emphasis on theories with extended supersymmetry, where the holomorphic twist gives rise to enhanced algebraic and geometric structures. We explain how these features emerge and govern the organization of the twisted theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a superconformal deformation of the twisted theory naturally leads to the associated vertex operator algebra, clarifying how the higher algebraic structures of the holomorphically twisted theory give rise to vertex algebras structures.

$Δ_T$ Noise as a Robust Diagnostic for Chiral, Helical and Trivial Edge Modes
Sachiraj Mishra, Colin Benjamin
Comments:
21 pages, 13 figures
Subjects:
Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive, practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature, finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.

Hasegawa-Mima equation in bounded domain with singular density

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the well-posedness of Hasegawa-Mima equation (HME) in bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary condition and singular density under different regularity assumptions on the data. Our approach relies on the coupling of a fourth-order regularization of the HME, the spectral Galerkin method and an appropriate regularization of the singular density. Uniqueness holds in the class of solutions with very mild singularities à la Yudovich or with bounded densities.

An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications

We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sjöstrand.
We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.

A nonlinear homogenization-based perspective on the soft modes and effective energies of some conformal metamaterials
Xuenan Li, Robert V. Kohn
Comments:
54 pages, 18 figures
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
There is a growing mechanics literature concerning the macroscopic properties of mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. This amounts mathematically to a homogenization problem involving nonlinear elasticity. A key goal is to identify the "soft modes" of the metamaterial. We achieve this goal using methods from homogenization for some specific 2D examples -- including discrete models of the Rotating Squares metamaterial and the Kagome metamaterial -- whose soft modes are compressive conformal maps. The innovation behind this achievement is a new technique for bounding the effective energy from below, which takes advantage of the metamaterial's structure and symmetry.

We discuss the Cahill-Glauber (CG) $s$-parameterized representation, a framework in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. We present the differential form of the hatted star product $\mathbin{\widehat{\star}_s}$, which emerges when we consider the inverse Cahill-Glauber (iCG) transform of a product of phase space functions. It appears to be the Hilbert space mirror of the usual star product $\mathbin{\star_s}$, and supports the interpretation of classical mechanics as the irreducible deformation of quantum mechanics by decoherence. Additionally, alternative forms of the evaluation of $\mathbin{\star_s}$ and $\mathbin{\widehat{\star}_s}$ are considered.

The main aim of this work is to present an explicit construction of a 2-design of ${\rm U}(2)$, relying only on a tool that belongs to every physicists toolbox: the theory of angular momentum. Unitary designs are a rich and fundamental mathematical topic, with numerous fruitful applications in quantum information science and technology. In this work we take a peek under the hood. We begin with a minimal set of definitions and characterizations. Then we derive all 1-designs of ${\rm U}(2)$ of minimum size. Finally, we set out, step by step, a completion procedure extending such 1-designs to 2-designs. In particular, starting from the Pauli basis $\unicode{x2014}$ the prototypical unitary 1-design $\unicode{x2014}$ one $\unicode{x201C}$naturally$\unicode{x201D}$ obtains the 2-design originally employed by Bennett and coauthors in $\textit{Mixed State Entanglement and Quantum Error Correction}$. The present work also serves as a gentle and largely self-contained introduction to the subject.

Equivalence relations between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames
Katarzyna Siudzińska
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Quantum measurements play a fundamental role in quantum information. Therefore, increasing efforts are being made to construct symmetric measurement operators for qudit systems. A wide class of projective measurements corresponds to complex projective 2-designs, which include symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVMs and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). In this paper, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames, both of which are common generalizations of SIC POVMs and MUBs to operators of arbitrary rank. It turns out that there exist rich families of operators that belong to only one of those two classes. This raises important questions about which symmetries have to be preserved for applicational prominence.

Bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures II: Tail profile of bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures in the exact scale-invariant case
Yichao Huang, Youtao Liu
Comments:
26 pages, 1 figure
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This is the second part of a series of papers where we consider questions related to the tail profile of the bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures appearing in boundary Liouville conformal field theory. In this part, we study of the right tail profile of a Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure with uniform singularity on the boundary, especially in the case of an exact scale-invariant kernel for the underlying log-correlated Gaussian field. This extends previous results by Rhodes-Vargas and Wong, where the case with flat background geometry (i.e. no boundary singularity) is studied using either the localization trick or some suitable versions of Tauberian theorems. Our generalization is non-trivial in the sense that we don't apply the localization trick to the bulk measure in question, but rather to an auxiliary Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure located at the boundary, on which the original bulk measure is not directly defined. We show that this modified localization scheme correctly captures the behavior of the right tail of the bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. The resulting tail profile coefficient is expressed in terms of a variant of bulk/boundary quotient of respective Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures, for which the well-definedness follows from preliminary joint moment bounds established previously in a companion paper.

The Asymptotic Analysis of Some PDE and Steklov Eigenvalue Problems with Partially Reactive Patches in 3-D
Denis S. Grebenkov, Michael J. Ward
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We consider steady-state diffusion in a three-dimensional bounded domain with a smooth reflecting boundary that is partially covered by small partially reactive patches. By using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these patches for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on these targets. After a brief overview of former contributions to this field, we first illustrate our approach by considering the classical problems of the mean first-reaction time (MFRT) and the splitting probability for partially reactive patches characterized by a Robin boundary condition. For a spherical domain, we derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the MFRT and splitting probabilities in the small-patch limit. This expansion is valid for arbitrary reactivities, and also accounts for the effect of the spatial configuration of patches on the boundary. Secondly, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-patch limit for a spherical domain. Extensions of these asymptotic results to arbitrary domains and their physical applications are discussed.

In this paper we review the quantization procedure employed by Jeffrey and Weitsman in their formalization of Witten's three manifold invariants. In so doing, we formalize the stratification of the Lagrangian leaf which corresponds to the flat connections of a bounding surface which extend into the handlebody. The smooth structure of this space motivates a procedure for a stratified quantization: use volumes and corresponding half-densities on the stratified tangent bundle. The pairing is then defined such that the proposed BKS pairing still yields the torsion in the integrand of the Jeffrey-Weitsman-Witten invariant. The stratification yields a natural covariant constant half-density which results in a reduction of the structure group for reducible connections. The conditions of their integral are refined in the context of the stratification and this change reproduces the invariant exactly for a plethora of 3-manifolds and extends the invariant for some.

Commutativity of operator algebras

We call an operator algebra A reversible if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the symmetric operator algebras: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a rather technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relation from mathematical physics plays a significant role.

Eyring-Kramers formula for the mean exit time of non-Gibbsian elliptic processes: the non characteristic boundary case

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
In this work, we derive a new sharp asymptotic equivalent in the small temperature regime $h\to 0$ for the mean exit time from a bounded domain for the non-reversible process $dX\_t=b(X\_t)dt + \sqrt h \, dB\_t$ under a generic orthogonal decomposition of $b$ and when the boundary of $\Omega$ is assumed to be \textit{non characteristic}. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that we do not assume that the process $(X\_t,t\ge 0)$ is \textit{Gibbsian}. In this case, a new correction term characterizing the \textit{non-Gibbsianness} of the process appears in the equivalent of the mean exit time. The proof is mainly based on tools from spectral and semi-classical analysis.

Real decomposable maps on operator systems

Subjects:

We initiate and study the theory of ``real decomposable maps" between real operator systems. (Formally, this is new even in the complex case, which hitherto has restricted itself to the case where the systems are complex $C^*$-algebras.) We investigate how the definition interacts with the existing theory (which it generalizes) and with the complexification. A surprising term appears in the `Jordan decomposition' of real decomposable maps. This term constitutes a new class of completely bounded maps, a class that also showed up in disguised form in our recent study of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, and whose theory is likely to have applications in that subject. We also check the real case of many important known results related to decomposability, for example about the weak expectation property or injectivity of von Neumann algebras.

Well-posedness of Ricci Flow in Lorentzian Spacetime and its Entropy Formula

Subjects:

This paper attempts to construct monotonic entropy functionals for four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime under certain physical boundary conditions, as an extension of Perelman's monotonic entropy functionals constructed for three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds. The monotonicity of these entropy functionals is utilized to prove the well-posedness of applying Ricci flow to four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, particularly for the timelike modes which would seem blow up and ill-defined. The general idea is that the the Ricci flow of a Lorentzian spacetime metric and the coupled conjugate heat flow of a density on the Lorentzian spacetime as a whole turns out to be the gradient flows of the monotonic functionals under some imposed constraint, so the superficial "blow-up" in the individual Ricci flow system or the conjugate heat flow system contradicts the boundedness of the monotonic functionals within finite flow interval, which gives a global control to the whole coupled system. The physical significance and applications of these monotonic entropy functionals in real gravitational systems are also discussed.

Differential equations are one of the main approaches to evaluate multi-loop Feynman integrals. The construction of a canonical or $\varepsilon$-factorised basis for multi-loop integrals remains a key bottleneck for this approach, especially when the differential equation involves non dlog-forms. Recently, several methods have been proposed to find $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. Many of them introduce new functions that are themselves defined as iterated integrals. If and when these iterated integrals can be explicitly evaluated in terms of other classes of functions remains an open problem. In this paper we elaborate on the recent proposal that one can use the fact that the intersection matrix computed in a canonical basis can be used to derive polynomial relations between these iterated integrals. On the one hand, we discuss properties of the canonical intersection matrix, in particular methods to determine the intersection matrix in a canonical basis. On the other hand we show how one can reduce the non-linear constraints on the iterated integrals to linear ones. We illustrate these ideas on examples involving Calabi-Yau varieties and higher-genus Riemann surfaces.

On the mean-field limit for the for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions
Feistl-Held Manuela, Pickl Peter
Subjects:

We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|>N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.

Subjects:

We establish an inequality relating the surface gravity and topology of a horizon in a $3$-dimensional asymptotically locally hyperbolic static space with the geometry at infinity. Equality is achieved only by the Kottler black holes, and this rigidity leads to several new static black hole uniqueness theorems for a negative cosmological constant. First, the ADS-Schwarzschild black hole with critical surface gravity $\kappa=\sqrt{-\Lambda}$ is unique. Second, the toroidal Kottler black holes are unique in the absence of spherical horizons. Third, the hyperbolic Kottler black holes with mass $m>0$ are unique *if* the generalized Penrose inequality holds for the corresponding class of static spaces. Building on work of Ge-Wang-Wu-Xia, we then use this fact to obtain uniqueness for static ALH graphs with hyperbolic infinities.
This inequality follows from a generalization of the Minkowski inequality in ADS-Schwarzschild space due to Brendle-Hung-Wang. Using optimal coefficients for the sub-static Heintze-Karcher inequality, we construct a new monotone quantity under inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in static spaces with ${\Lambda} < 0$. Another fundamental tool developed in this paper is a regularity theorem for IMCF in asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds. Specifically, we prove that a weak solution of IMCF in an ALH 3-manifold with horizon boundary is eventually smooth. This extends the regularity theorem for a spherical infinity due to Shi and Zhu.

Subjects:

This paper is devoted to the problem of optimal generation of N-qubit gates for closed quantum systems -- a key task for the practical implementation of various quantum applications. Based on the generalized Bloch vectors formalism for a finite-dimensional quantum system, we develop a new optimal gates generation model, which is universal in the sense that it is applicable for an arbitrary N-qubit gate, any Hamiltonian of a closed N-qubit system and within this model an optimal control is determined only by N-qubit system parameters and does not depend on its initial state. Within the developed model, the synthesis of optimal control, carried out via the Pontryagin principle, leads to the boundary value problem for the system of ODEs, which can be explored by various computational methods. Numerical experiments conducted for generation of a variety of one/two/three qubit gates demonstrate viability of the developed optimal model which allows one to generate N-qubit quantum gates with a high degree of precision.

We consider the Renormalization Group (RG) fixed-point theory associated with a fermionic $\psi^4_d$ model in $d=1,2,3$ with fractional kinetic term, whose scaling dimension is fixed so that the quartic interaction is weakly relevant in the RG sense. The model is defined in terms of a Grassmann functional integral with interaction $V^*$, solving a fixed-point RG equation in the presence of external fields, and a fixed ultraviolet cutoff. We define and construct the field and density scale-invariant response functions, and prove that the critical exponent of the former is the naive one, while that of the latter is anomalous and analytic. We construct the corresponding (almost-)scaling operators, whose two point correlations are scale-invariant up to a remainder term, which decays like a stretched exponential at distances larger than the inverse of the ultraviolet cutoff. Our proof is based on constructive RG methods and, specifically, on a convergent tree expansion for the generating function of correlations, which generalizes the approach developed by three of the authors in a previous publication [A. Giuliani, V. Mastropietro, S. Rychkov, JHEP 01 (2021) 026].

Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha > 2 D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D +1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha>0$, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.

Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.

Moduli space of spin connections on three-dimensional homogeneous spaces

In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous SU(2) connections on three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy groups.
Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in the cosmological setting.

A Homothetic Gauge Theory

Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We introduce a Homothetic Hodge-de Rham (HHDR) theory that extends the de Rham complex to homothetically transformed differential forms and develops the associated homothetic Hodge machinery. Enforcing homothetic symmetry on physical laws naturally yields scale-covariant couplings, interpretable as canonical penalty terms in the framework of differential equations. Building on this foundation, we construct a Homothetic Gauge Theory (HGT) and apply it to classical electromagnetism, leading to generalized homothetic Maxwell equations. The approach establishes a link between homothetic scaling and conformal field theory concepts such as the dilaton field and vacuum expectation values (VEVs). As a concrete physical application, we address the classical divergence of point charge self-energy. By modeling the source as a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition, we obtain a non-singular electrostatic potential. This framework highlights a mathematically rigorous and physically meaningful extension of gauge theory with potential relevance across field theory and electrodynamics.

Exact Solution for Two $δ$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $δ$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States

Subjects:

In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.

We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, we show that the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution converges to the Fourier/Mellin transform of a measure, which and the limiting empirical distribution are intimately related by the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence can be studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.

We define a generalized form of $L_\infty$-algebras called $E_2L_\infty$-algebras. As we show, these provide the natural algebraic framework for generalized geometry and the symmetries of double field theory as well as the gauge algebras arising in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. Our perspective shows that the kinematical data of the tensor hierarchy is an adjusted higher gauge theory, which is important for developing finite gauge transformations as well as non-local descriptions. Mathematically, $E_2L_\infty$-algebras shed some light on Loday's problem of integrating Leibniz algebras.

Crossing estimates for the Ising model on general s-embeddings

We prove Russo-Seymour-Welsh type crossing estimates for the FK-Ising model on general s-embeddings whose origami map has an asymptotic Lipschitz constant strictly smaller than $1$, provided a mild non-degeneracy assumption is satisfied. This result extends the original work of Chelkak and provides a general framework to prove that connection probabilities between boundaries of boxes remain bounded away from $0$ and $1$. It is explained that one cannot prove similar estimates without a similar assumption on the origami map, and allows to propose some notion of critical model for generic planar graphs, that can be rephrased from the perspective of the associated propagator operator. This paper reproves along the way corresponding results in almost all already known setups and also treats new ones of interest.

Recently, [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1] considered spin glass models with additional conventional order parameters characterizing single-replica properties. These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1214/17-AOP1194], where the order parameter for self-overlap is already present.

We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by this http URL, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.

Among the important results, we show that the minimal entropy arises for sharp localization, and the maximal entropy occurs for equidistribution. We also study other interesting estimates of entropy and divergence for numbers and for ideals. Finally, we determine the entropies of probability distributions on infinite trees of Schur {\sigma}-groups, which are realized by 3-class field tower groups of imaginary quadratic number fields.

Twisted holography captures protected aspects of well-known holographic dualities. We show how the holographic dual B-model background can be systematically derived from the 't Hooft expansion of the chiral algebras associated to four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories. A crucial tool is the match of planar BRST anomalies in the field theory and on the worldsheet, especially in the presence of probe D-branes. Our construction is very general and can be applied to chiral algebras which do not have a four-dimensional origin. The resulting holographic dual backgrounds are typically non-geometric and appear to be novel. We expect our strategy to have a wide range of applications to other examples of twisted holography and, potentially, weak coupling holography.

Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant

The logarithm-determinant is an widely-present operation in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix with precision $\varepsilon$. A practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O((k\log_2 N)/\varepsilon^2)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. The best classical method we are aware of scales as $N$.
Given the same resource assumptions as other algorithms, such that an equal superposition of eigenvectors is available efficiently, the algorithm is evaluated in the practical case as $O(\log_2 N/\varepsilon^2)$. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.

We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.

This model shows a phase transition with respect to the halt probability. Second, a constrained partition model (Einstein-solid combinatorics) recovers the same logarithmic profile as the maximum-entropy solution under a coarse-grained entropy-rate constraint, clarifying the role of non-ergodicity (ensemble vs. trajectory averages). We also perform numerical experiments that corroborate our conclusions.

Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

Title:
Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model

The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Elias' Encoding from Lagrangians and Renormalization

In the present paper we give a principled derivation of Elias' Omega code by combining a constrained variational formulation of prefix coding with a renormalization flow on codeword distributions. Starting from a Lagrangian that minimizes average code length under the Kraft-McMillan constraint, we show that the implied distribution is a fixed point of a coarse-graining map, yielding the canonical iterated logarithm length, up to an additive constant.
This establishes completeness and asymptotic optimality, and connects universal integer coding with coarse-grained entropy, uncertainty-type bounds, and multiplicity relations familiar from statistical physics. The renormalization operator induces a discrete flow that converges to the Elias fixed point for any admissible initialization, up to a bounded error, offering a clean bridge between information-theoretic constraints and RG-style scale invariance.

Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.

Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As condensed matter physics applications, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices and analytically determine the asymptotics of the return probability. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.

Loss-Complexity Landscape and Model Structure Functions

We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

Title:
Exact results for active particle models: from long-range interactions to first-passage properties

PhD thesis defended on June 12, 2025 at Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS), Paris. 215 pages

The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.

We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.
