Title:
Spontaneous stochasticity in the Armstrong-Vicol passive scalar

Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Spontaneous stochasticity refers to the emergence of intrinsic randomness in deterministic systems under singular limits, a phenomenon conjectured to be fundamental in turbulence. Armstrong and Vicol recently constructed a deterministic, divergence-free multiscale vector field arbitrarily close to a weak Euler solution, proving that a passive scalar transported by this field exhibits anomalous dissipation and lacks a selection principle in the vanishing diffusivity limit. We show that this advection-diffusion PDE also selects a non-Dirac measure in the space of weak solutions in the inviscid limit, thereby exhibiting Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity. We further provide numerical evidence of Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity, together with a numerical illustration of the Obukhov-Corrsin conjecture for this system. We formulate a general framework for spontaneous stochasticity in arbitrary finite dimensional systems under arbitrary regularizations, distinguishing two regimes: weak, where different probability measures may arise along subsequences of inviscid limits, and strong, where the limit measure is unique. The advection diffusion system of Armstrong and Vicol lies in the strong regime. We prove that the set of selected measures is compact and equals the closed convex hull of Dirac measures. Moreover, for any non-Dirac measure supported on the set of nonunique solutions of the inviscid system, there exists a regularization that produces strong spontaneous stochasticity. Finally, we relate this framework to renormalization-group methods à la Feigenbaum and examine how the underlying dynamical system influences the inviscid limit. The discussion is complemented by elementary finite-dimensional examples illustrating a variety of cases.

Classical first passage problems for $p$-adic stochastic processes
A.Kh. Bikulov, A.P. Zubarev
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the solution of the classical problem of finding the distribution density of a random variable - the first passage time to a given domain by the trajectory of a $p$-adic Markov stochastic process with probability density function satisfying the solution of the Cauchy problem for the Vladimirov equation (a $p$-adic analog of the Kolmogorov-Feller equation with the kernel of the Vladimirov operator) with uniform initial distribution in the unit ball. We consider three equivalent approaches to obtain equations for the distribution density of a random variable - the first passage time to a given domain by a stochastic trajectory. We find a solution to these equations for the distribution density, analyze its properties, and compare them with the properties of the distribution density of a random variable - the first return timeof a stochastic trajectory to the support of the initial distribution. We also solve the problem of finding the number of hittings a given domain and analyze the solution obtained. In conclusion, we discuss a class of problems related to the study of the distribution density of the passage time to a given domain and the return time to the initial domain for other types of $p$-adic Markov stochastic processes.

Title:
An easier way to compute 2-cocycles coming from a reduction for semidirect products
Viacheslav Goncharov

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
For Hamiltonian actions of semidirect products $G=F \ltimes H$, we study 2-cocycles arising from residual Hamiltonian actions of $F$ on Hamiltonian reductions for $H$. The motivation comes from the study of Teichmuller spaces for surfaces with boundary, which carry Hamiltonian actions of the Virasoro algebra. In this paper, we give a general setup for the problem, and we suggest an easier way to obtain the Gelfand-Fuchs 2-cocycles for Hamiltonian actions on Teichmuller spaces.

Title:
Higher-form symmetries as higher automorphism bundles
Alonso Perez-Lona
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Category Theory (math.CT)
The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.

On the pair correlation function of the Sine$_β$ process

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the Sine$_\beta$ process, the bulk point process scaling limit of beta-ensembles. We provide a representation of its pair correlation function for all $\beta>0$ via a stochastic differential equation. We show that the pair correlation function is continuous in $\beta$, and provide estimates for its asymptotic decay. We recover the classical explicit formula for the pair correlation function in the $\beta=2$ and $4$ cases. For $\beta=2n$, we derive the power series expansion of the pair correlation function, and express it in terms of a size $n$ linear ordinary differential equation system. We obtain our results by studying the density of the $\operatorname{HP}_{\beta,\delta}$ process, the point process limit of the circular Jacobi beta-ensembles.

On Markowitz's pseudodistance for conformal manifolds

Subjects:

In the 1980s, M. J. Markowitz introduced a conformally invariant pseudodistance on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, inspired by the Kobayashi metric in projective geometry. This construction relies on a distinguished class of parametrized lightlike geodesics, called projectively parametrized. We begin by reviewing the fundamental properties of this pseudodistance and provide several families of examples where it is non-degenerate and, in some cases, complete. In particular, we investigate three classes of manifolds: closed manifolds, conformally convex domains of the Einstein universe, and globally hyperbolic, conformally flat, $C$-maximal spacetimes. For the first two classes, we obtain results analogous to those of Brody and Barth concerning the complex Kobayashi metric. Finally, we apply Markowitz's pseudodistance to classify all quasi-homogeneous domains of the Einstein-de Sitter space, that is, a half-space of Minkowski space bounded by a spacelike hyperplane. Up to conformal transformations, only finitely many such domains exist, and all of them turn out to be homogeneous.

Gaussian fermionic embezzlement of entanglement

Embezzlement of entanglement allows to extract arbitrary entangled states from a suitable embezzling state using only local operations while perturbing the resource state arbitrarily little. A natural family of embezzling states is given by ground states of non-interacting, critical fermions in one spatial dimension. This raises the question of whether the embezzlement operations can be restricted to Gaussian operations whenever one only wishes to extract Gaussian entangled states. We show that this is indeed the case and prove that the embezzling property is in fact a generic property of fermionic Gaussian states. Our results provide a fine-grained understanding of embezzlement of entanglement for fermionic Gaussian states in the finite-size regime and thereby bridge finite-size systems to abstract characterizations based on the classification of von Neumann algebras. To prove our results, we establish novel bounds relating the distance of covariances to the trace-distance of Gaussian states, which may be of independent interest.

Symmetries Beget Symmetries: Ghostly Higher-Form Symmetries and the Descent Equation

Viewed through the lens of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we demonstrate that higher-form currents with nonzero ghost number also define higher-form symmetries, directly analogous to the standard higher-form symmetries with ghost number zero. These ghostly higher symmetries descend from and into conventional higher-form symmetries via chains of descent equations familiar from the theory of anomalies and topological field theories. We give examples of such chains of ghostly symmetries in Maxwell theory, Abelian and non-Abelian higher gauge theory, Yang-Mills theory, and beyond.

$η_{\rm w}$-meson from topological properties of the electroweak vacuum

We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous $B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the $B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.

Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory
Callum Bell, David Sloan
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.

Topological edge states of continuous Hamiltonians

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)
This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.

We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.

WKB structure in a scalar model of flat bands
Semyon Dyatlov, Henry Zeng, Maciej Zworski
Comments:
54 pages, 14 figures
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider a family of periodic scalar operators for which one can define flat bands in the sense of Floquet-Bloch theory. One puzzling question originating in recent physics literature is a quantisation rule for the values of parameters at which these flat bands occur. We present a general theorem about the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic argument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also explains the quantisation condition - both the WKB structure and that rule are confirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in which separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods.

Gauged compact Q-balls and Q-shells in a multi-component $CP^N$ model

We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains Q-balls/shells, which are non-topological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, Q-shells can shelter another compact Q-ball or Q-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multi-compacton formations is affected by electric charge. We are interested in structures with non-zero or zero total net charge.

A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions

Subjects:
Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We mathematically model Smectic-A (SmA) phases with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The orientational order of the SmA phase is described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which models the deviation from the average density of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of global minimisers of the mLdG free energy in three-dimensional settings. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can capture the Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition as a function of temperature, under some assumptions. Further, we explore stable smectic phases on a square domain, with edge length $\lambda$, and tangent boundary conditions. We use heuristic arguments to show that defects repel smectic layers and strong nematic ordering promotes layer formation. We use asymptotic arguments in the $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$ limits which reveal the correlation between the number and thickness of smectic layers, the amplitude of density fluctuations with the phenomenological parameters in the mLdG energy. For finite values of $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like stable smectic states observed in experiments. We also study the frustrated mLdG energy landscape and give numerical examples of transition pathways between distinct mLdG energy minimisers.

The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.

All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination: Robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources

Which quantum phenomena are advantageous for information processing tasks? By classifying quantum states as resourceful versus non-resourceful, or free, the mathematical formalism of quantum resource theories helps to address such questions. For the task of discriminating channels applied to a probe state, it has been shown that under certain conditions -- namely, the set of free states being convex or finite dimensional -- every resourceful probe state can provide an advantage, quantified by a resource monotone known as generalized robustness. In this work, bypassing the limitations of previous studies, we define the generalized robustness for an arbitrary resource theory and show that it admits two operational interpretations. Firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in channel discrimination tasks implemented on multiple copies of the probe states. Secondly, in many physically relevant theories, it quantifies the advantage in single-copy channel discrimination tasks in a worst case scenario. We further present a general construction of multi-copy resource witnesses and provide practical methods to bound the generalized robustness in experiments. Finally, we apply our results to a key case study in continuous variable quantum information: the resource theory of non-Gaussianity. This theory is naturally defined by a set of free states (Gaussian states) that is non-convex and infinite-dimensional. Our work then shows conclusively that all non-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination task, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states and are typically disregarded for other quantum information tasks. To illustrate our findings, we provide exact formulas for the robustness of non-Gaussianity of Fock states, along with an analysis of the robustness for a family of non-Gaussian states within the convex hull of Gaussian states.

Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.

Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a new formulation of the problem based on the \emph{belief propagation (BP) channel}, namely a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map that realizes local perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we prove that establishing the quasi-locality of BP channels implies the decay of CMI, thereby reducing the original conjecture to a more tractable problem. We show that such quasi-local BP channels can be constructed under natural physical conditions, such as uniform rapid mixing or uniform clustering. Under these assumptions, we obtain conditional proofs of CMI decay valid at all temperatures. Moreover, because these assumptions are automatically satisfied at high temperatures, our results in that regime yield unconditional proofs of CMI decay. At the same time, in order to better understand the high-temperature behavior of Gibbs states, we revisit the cluster expansion method. Contrary to common intuition, we demonstrate that when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered, the cluster expansion suffers from intrinsic divergence problems rooted in the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula, revealing fundamental limitations of this traditional approach.

We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the complex $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the real $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.

Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurements of packing density. We introduce this http URL, an open-source Julia package providing analytic partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centred cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. this http URL converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and scales linearly with particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). this http URL provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.

In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.

Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.
