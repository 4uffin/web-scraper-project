Title:
Alternative tangent and cotangent structures and their physical applications
José F. Cariñena, Jesús Clemente-Gallardo, Giuseppe Marmo
Comments:

The conditions under which a given manifold $M$ may be given a tangent bundle or a cotangent bundle structure are analyzed. This is an important property arising in different contexts. For instance, in the study of integrability of a given dynamics the existence of alternative compatible structures is very relevant, as well as in the geometric approach to Classical Mechanics. On the other hand in the quantum-to-classical transition, a Weyl system plays an important role for it provides (within the so-called Weyl-Wigner formalism) a description of quantum mechanics on a (symplectic) phase-space $M$. A Lagrangian subspace $Q\subset M$ of the (linear) phase space determines thus a maximal set of pairwise commuting unitary operators, which is used to parametrize the quantum states. As the choice of this maximal Abelian set of observables is not unique, the different choices make the phase space to become diffeomorphic to different cotangent bundles $T^*Q$ corresponding to different choices for the base manifold (and hence the fibers). These motivating ideas are used to study how to define alternative tangent and/or cotangent bundle structures on a phase space.

Complex Lies, Real Physics: The Role of Algebra Complexification

In physics, Lie groups represent the algebraic structure that describes symmetry transformations of a given system. Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\left(\mathfrak{g}^\mathbb{R}\right)_\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathfrak{g} \times \bar{\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\frac{1}{2},0) \oplus (0,\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions. This means that the mathematical group structure determines the material content of the universe following this algebraic structure.

Title:
Two Decades of Probabilistic Approach to Liouville Conformal Field Theory
Rémi Rhodes, Vincent Vargas
Comments:
Proceedings of the ICM 2026
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR)
Over the past twenty years, the probabilistic approach to Liouville Conformal Field Theory (LCFT) has undergone remarkable developments, transforming a collection of ideas at the interface of probability, geometry, complex analysis and physics into a coherent mathematical theory. Building on Gaussian Free Fields and Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos, rigorous definitions of correlation functions and partition functions have been established, culminating in the probabilistic derivation of the DOZZ formula and a mathematically complete formulation of the conformal bootstrap for LCFT on Riemann surfaces. This survey aims to provide a synthetic account of these advances, emphasizing both the main achievements and the open problems that continue to drive the field.

On the Onsager-Machlup functional of the $Φ^4$-measure
Ioannis Gasteratos, Zachary Selk
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the existence of generalised densities for the $\Phi^4_d$ $(d=1,2,3)$ measures, in finite volume, through the lens of Onsager-Machlup (OM) functionals. The latter are rigorously defined for measures on metric spaces as limiting ratios of small ball probabilities. In one dimension, we show that the standard OM functional of the $\Phi^4_1$ measure coincides with the $\Phi^4$ action as expected. In two dimensions, we show that OM functionals of the $P(\Phi)_2$ measures agree with the corresponding actions, by considering ``enhanced" distances, defined with respect to Wick powers of the Gaussian Free Field, which are analogous to rough path metrics. In dimension $3$, two natural generalisations of the OM functional are proved to be degenerate. Finally, we recover the $\Phi^4_3$ action, under appropriate regularity conditions, by considering joint small radius-large frequency limits.

Causal perturbation theory and scattering amplitudes
H.A.C. Grande, J.C.A Barata
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Motivated by the limited interaction between the mathematical physics community and theoretical physicists - particularly in high-energy theory - we present a computation that is typically the first example in QFT courses but, to our knowledge, does not appear in the literature: the scattering amplitudes of the $\lambda \phi^4$ model in four-dimensional space-time, derived within the framework of causal perturbation theory. Our aim is to introduce this mathematically rigorous formalism in the most accessible way possible. To that end, we emphasize general aspects of the theory while deliberately avoiding overly sophisticated mathematics. Finally, we briefly discuss how the divergent integrals encountered in quantum field theory can be reinterpreted as issues concerning the domain of distributions.

Non-Commutative Gauge Theory at the Beach

Comments:
48 pages + 10 page appendix, 1 figure
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
The KP equation is perhaps the most famous example of a three-dimensional integrable system. Here we show that a non-commutative five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory living on the projective spinor bundle of three-dimensional space-time compactifies to a Lagrangian formulation of the KP equation. Essential to the definition of the theory is a 2-form pulled back from minitwistor space. The dispersionless limit of the KP equation is similarly described by Poisson-Chern-Simons theory. We further show that, consistent with integrability, all tree level amplitudes vanish. The universal vertex algebra living on a two-dimensional surface defect in $5d$ is $W_{1+\infty}$, and its operator products coincide with collinear splitting functions on space-time. Taking the dispersionless limit contracts the vertex algebra to $w_{1+\infty}$.

The Dirac operator with MIT bag boundary condition in a bounded convex domain is shown to be always self-adjoint in the $H^1$-setting. This allows one to show that such operators appear as limit of Dirac operators with large positive mass outside the domain. Similar results were previously known for smooth domains only.

Small-$b$ expansion of the DOZZ formula for light operators

Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We present a systematic small-$b$ expansion of the Liouville DOZZ three-point structure constant in the light-operator regime $\alpha_i = b\sigma_i$ as $b\to 0$. In this limit, the exact DOZZ function factorizes into a prefactor $\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ and a power series in $b^2$, \[ C(b\sigma_1,b\sigma_2,b\sigma_3) =\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_i)\Bigl[1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty b^{2n}\,\Omega_n(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\Bigr]. \] Using Thorn's asymptotic expansion of the $\Upsilon_b$-function, we derive closed-form expressions for the leading coefficients $\Omega_n(\sigma_i)$ and show that each $\Omega_n$ is a symmetric polynomial in the variables $\sigma_i$. Our expansion provides explicit perturbative corrections to the semiclassical Liouville three-point function and therefore supplies a practical tool for applications in celestial holography, in particular, for generating loop-level corrections to the tree-level three-gluon scattering amplitude using the inverse Mellin transform. We conclude by outlining these directions for further development. In particular, we highlight that a primary next step is to extend this framework to four-point amplitudes.

Towards mixed phase correlators in monomial matrix models
A. Popolitov
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Correlators in monomial Hermitian matrix model strongly depend on the choice of eigenvalue integration contours. We express Schur correlator in case of several different integration contours (mixed phase case) as a sum over products of Schur correlators for just one type of contour (pure phase), where expansion coefficients are manifestly made from Littlewood-Richardson and Mugnaghan-Nakayama coefficients.
Further, for pure phase Schur correlators we find concise superintegrability formulas that unify both usual and exotic cases, that before looked very different from one another.

Title:
Laplacian Eigenfunction-Based Neural Operator for Learning Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics
Jindong Wang, Wenrui Hao
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Learning reaction-diffusion equations has become increasingly important across scientific and engineering disciplines, including fluid dynamics, materials science, and biological systems. In this work, we propose the Laplacian Eigenfunction-Based Neural Operator (LE-NO), a novel framework designed to efficiently learn nonlinear reaction terms in reaction-diffusion equations. LE-NO models the nonlinear operator on the right-hand side using a data-driven approach, with Laplacian eigenfunctions serving as the basis. This spectral representation enables efficient approximation of the nonlinear terms, reduces computational complexity through direct inversion of the Laplacian matrix, and alleviates challenges associated with limited data and large neural network architectures-issues commonly encountered in operator learning. We demonstrate that LE-NO generalizes well across varying boundary conditions and provides interpretable representations of learned dynamics. Numerical experiments in mathematical physics showcase the effectiveness of LE-NO in capturing complex nonlinear behavior, offering a powerful and robust tool for the discovery and prediction of reaction-diffusion dynamics.

Higher-order tacnodes in a free fermionic model
Andrea Maroncelli, Jean-Marie Stéphan
Comments:
v3, 30 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
We investigate a one-dimensional free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. Such types of models are quantum reformulations of well-studied two-dimensional classical lattice models, which are known to give rise to limit shapes where expectation values of simple local observables, such as density, depend on position in an appropriate scaling limit. In the case of only nearest neighbor hopping, this model is known to have two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Correlations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. Here we show that another universal higher-order tacnode process can appear upon including the next-nearest neighbor term. We also discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile.

Title:
Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices
Yan V Fyodorov
Comments:
Essentially updated version, containing considerable new material, in particular in the sections on additive deformations, including analysis of the non-Hermitian Rosenzweig-Porter model
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Probability (math.PR)
We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) for non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The approach is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we derive ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ in the two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a general fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we analyze the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we further analyze non-Hermitian Rosenzweig-Porter model which recently attracted considerable interest in physics literature. In addition, we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier emerging as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.

SU(N) integrals and tau functions
A. Yu. Orlov
Comments:
9 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We present a family of solvable multi-matrix models associated with an arbitrary embedded graph $\Gamma$ with a single vertex. The graph with $n$ edges is equipped with $2n$ corner matrices. The partition function of each member of the family depends on the set of eigenvalues of monodromies of corner matrices around the vertices of the dual graph $\Gamma^*$ and sets of parameters attached to each vertex of $\Gamma$. We select the cases where the partition function of a model is a tau function of KP, 2KP and BKP hiearachies. We compare integrals over ${U}(N)$ and over ${SU}(N)$ groups. In $U(N)$ case there is no restriction on the number of vertices of $\Gamma$.

Ferromagnetic ground states have often been overlooked in comparison to seemingly more interesting antiferromagnetic ground states. However, both the physical and mathematical structure of ferromagnetic ground states are particularly rich. We show that the highly degenerate and highly entangled ground states of the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model are scale invariant, originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm U}(1)\times {\rm U}(1)$ with two type-B Goldstone modes if the system size is even or from ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$ with one type-B Goldstone mode if the system size is odd, when periodic boundary conditions are adopted. The ground state degeneracies are characterized as Fibonacci-Lucas sequences, under open and periodic boundary conditions, with nonzero residual entropy per site. This implies that the ground state degeneracies for this model are asymptotically the golden spiral. In addition, sequences of atypical (periodic) degenerate ground states generated from highest and generalized highest weight states are constructed to establish that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit. The prefactor is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes, which is identified to be the fractal dimension, if one is restricted to atypical degenerate ground states. We also argue that the same conclusion is valid for typical (non-periodic) degenerate ground states, as long as the block size is sufficiently large.

In multi-parameter quantum metrology, the resource of entanglement can lead to an increase in efficiency of the estimation process. Entanglement can be used in the state preparation stage, or the measurement stage, or both, to harness this advantage; here we focus on the role of entangling measurements. Specifically, entangling or collective measurements over multiple identical copies of a probe state are known to be superior to measuring each probe individually, but the extent of this improvement is an open problem. It is also known that such entangling measurements, though resource-intensive, are required to attain the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks. In this work we investigate the maximum precision improvement that collective quantum measurements can offer over individual measurements for estimating parameters of qudit states, calling this the 'collective quantum enhancement'. We show that, whereas the maximum enhancement can, in principle, be a factor of $n$ for estimating $n$ parameters, this bound is not tight for large $n$. Instead, our results prove an enhancement linear in dimension of the qudit is possible using collective measurements and lead us to conjecture that this is the maximum collective quantum enhancement in any local estimation scenario.

Quantum Mycielskians: symmetries, twin vertices and distinguishing labelings

We investigate a quantum generalization of the Mycielski construction for quantum graphs. In particular, we analyze the quantum symmetries of quantum Mycielskians and their relation to the symmetries of the underlying quantum graphs. We introduce a quantum analogue of graphs with twin vertices and show that, for classical graphs with a small number of vertices, this notion reduces to the classical one. Finally, we propose a quantum extension of the distinguishing number and examine its behavior under the quantum Mycielski construction.

A new asymptotic regime for the KdV equation with Wigner-von Neumann type initial data
Alexei Rybkin
Comments:
To appear in Journal of Nonlinear Waves
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation, focusing on the evolution of the radiant wave associated with a Wigner-von Neumann (WvN) resonance induced by the initial data (potential). A WvN resonance refers to an energy level where the potential exhibits zero transmission (complete reflection). The corresponding Jost solution at such energy becomes singular, and in the NLS context, this is referred to as a spectral singularity. A WvN resonance represents a long-range phenomenon, often introducing significant challenges, such as an infinite negative spectrum, when employing the inverse scattering transform (IST). To avoid some of these issues, we consider a restricted class of initial data that generates a WvN resonance but for which the IST framework can be suitably adapted. For this class of potentials, we demonstrate that each WvN resonance produces a distinct asymptotic regime -- termed the resonance regime -- characterized by a slower decay rate for large time compared to the radiant waves associated with short-range initial data.

We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, study non-adiabatic features in the dynamics of a three-level time-dependent detuning model, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.

We investigate the ground states of neutron stars and white dwarfs in the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theories. It is known that the system is stable below a critical mass, which depends on the gravitational constant, while it becomes unstable if the total mass exceeds the critical mass. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB minimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant, while the HF minimizers exist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is fully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal systems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass case established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].

Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere

In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.

Exploiting Non-Markovian Memory Effects for Robust Quantum Teleportation
Safae Gaidi, Nour-Eddine Abouelkhir, Abdallah Slaoui, Mohammed El Falaki, Rachid Ahl Laamara
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence, which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM) with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.

Random close packing fraction of bidisperse discs: Theoretical derivation and exact bounds
Raphael Blumenfeld
Comments:
5 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.
