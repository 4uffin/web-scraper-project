Title:
Research and development as a driver of innovation and economic growth; case of developing economies
Ayusha Fayyaz, Zoltan Bartha
Journal-ref:
Journal of Social and Economic Development, 2025
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
The goal of this research is to uncover the channels through which research and development (R&D) impacts economic growth in developing countries. The study employed nine variables from three broader categories in the World Economic Forum database, each covering 32 countries from the lower-middle-income group for the year 2019. The theoretical framework is based on the R&D ecosystem, which includes components such as Institutions, Human capital, Capital market, R&D, and Innovation. Each of these components can contribute to the economic development of the country. Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), we build a path diagram to visualize and confirm a potential relationship between the components. R&D features had a positive impact on innovation (regression weight estimate: +0.34, p = 0.001), as did capital market institutions (regression weight estimate: +0.12, p = 0.007), but neither had a significant impact on growth. According to the Schumpeterian institutional interpretation, R&D and innovation efforts may not lead to sustained growth in middle-income countries. We find no significant connection between innovation performance and economic growth. This suggests that while R&D and capital markets may contribute to innovation through entrepreneurship, this contribution is not impactful enough to drive economic growth in developing countries. Our findings provide further evidence of the middle-income trap.

Title:
Changes in varieties of capitalism within the OECD between 2010 and 2020
Zoltan Bartha
Journal-ref:
International Journal of Public Policy, 2024
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This study aims to reveal different varieties of capitalism and to uncover new patterns of development that emerged between 2010 and 2020. A hybrid model is applied that quantifies three pillars of development (Future - F, Outside - O, Inside - I) using supply-side and demand-side indicators that measure norms, institutions, and policies. Investigating 34 OECD members, this study describes five varieties of capitalism: traditional, dualistic, government-led, open market-based, and human capital-based models. It is suggested that the most significant cut-off point in the development of OECD economies in this period was along the green growth dimension, where European countries with a tradition in coordinated markets outperform the rest. Using Israel and Estonia as an example, it is also suggested that institutional and policy changes that enhance the quality of governance and make coordination more effective are the way out of the middle-income trap.

Title:
Gender and Agricultural Commercialization in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Three Panel Surveys
Wei Li, Kashi Kafle, Anna Josephson
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Agricultural commercialization is often promoted as a key driver of development in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet its benefits may not extend equally to all farmers. Using longitudinal household data from the LSMS-ISA and a two-way Mundlak fixed effects estimator, we examine the relationship between farmers' gender and agricultural commercialization in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania. In Ethiopia and Nigeria, women-headed households and those with a higher share of women-managed land face substantial disadvantages in market engagement, particularly in households oriented towards self-consumption. Interestingly, in both countries, women-headed households that do engage in sales are more likely to sell to market buyers and less likely to sell to individual buyers compared to men-headed households. In contrast, in Tanzania, the negative associations between gender and commercialization are weaker and less robust across outcomes. Overall, these findings demonstrate that gender gaps in commercialization are highly context-specific rather than universal, highlighting the need for country-tailored policies that address the institutional and market constraints faced by women farmers.

Title:
Long-Range Dependence in Financial Markets: Empirical Evidence and Generative Modeling Challenges
Yifan He, Svetlozar Rachev

Subjects:
Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST); Computational Finance (q-fin.CP)
This study presents a comprehensive empirical investigation of the presence of long-range dependence (LRD) in the dynamics of major U.S. stock market indexes--S\&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq--at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. We employ three distinct methods: the classical rescaled range (R/S) analysis, the more robust detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and a sophisticated ARFIMA--FIGARCH model with Student's $t$-distributed innovations. Our results confirm the presence of LRD, primarily driven by long memory in volatility rather than in the mean returns. Building on these findings, we explore the capability of a modern deep learning approach, Quant generative adversarial networks (GANs), to learn and replicate the LRD observed in the empirical data. While Quant GANs effectively capture heavy-tailed distributions and some aspects of volatility clustering, they suffer from significant limitations in reproducing the LRD, particularly at higher frequencies. This work highlights the challenges and opportunities in using data-driven models for generating realistic financial time series that preserve complex temporal dependencies.

Title:
Roughness Analysis of Realized Volatility and VIX through Randomized Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distribution
Sergio Bianchi, Daniele Angelini

Subjects:
Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF); Computational Finance (q-fin.CP); Methodology (stat.ME)
We introduce a novel distribution-based estimator for the Hurst parameter of log-volatility, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to assess the scaling behavior of entire distributions rather than individual moments. To address the temporal dependence of financial volatility, we propose a random permutation procedure that effectively removes serial correlation while preserving marginal distributions, enabling the rigorous application of the KS framework to dependent data. We establish the asymptotic variance of the estimator, useful for inference and confidence interval construction. From a computational standpoint, we show that derivative-free optimization methods, particularly Brent's method and the Nelder-Mead simplex, achieve substantial efficiency gains relative to grid search while maintaining estimation accuracy. Empirical analysis of the CBOE VIX index and the 5-minute realized volatility of the S&P 500 reveals a statistically significant hierarchy of roughness, with implied volatility smoother than realized volatility. Both measures, however, exhibit Hurst exponents well below one-half, reinforcing the rough volatility paradigm and highlighting the open challenge of disentangling local roughness from long-memory effects in fractional modeling.

Title:
Healthy diets are affordable but often displaced by other foods in Indonesia
Leah Costlow, Rachel Gilbert, William A. Masters, Flaminia Ortenzi, Ty Beal, Ashish Deo, Widya Sutiyo, Sutamara Noor, Wendy Gonzalez
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
New methods for modeling least-cost diets that meet nutritional requirements for health have emerged as important tools for informing nutrition policy and programming around the world. This study develops a three-step approach using cost of healthy diet to inform targeted nutrition programming in Indonesia. We combine detailed retail prices and household survey data from Indonesia to describe how reported consumption and expenditure patterns across all levels of household income diverge from least cost healthy diets using items from nearby markets. In this analysis, we examine regional price variations, identify households with insufficient income for healthy diets, and analyze the nutrient adequacy of reported consumption patterns. We find that household food spending was sufficient to meet national dietary guidelines using the least expensive locally available items for over 98% of Indonesians, but almost all households consume substantial quantities of discretionary foods and mixed dishes while consuming too little energy from fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and seeds. Households with higher incomes have higher nutrient adequacy and are closer to meeting local dietary guidelines, but still fall short of recommendations. These findings shed new light on how actual food demand differs from least-cost healthy diets, due to factors other than affordability, such as taste, convenience, and aspirations shaped by marketing and other sociocultural influences.

Title:
Multimodal Language Models with Modality-Specific Experts for Financial Forecasting from Interleaved Sequences of Text and Time Series

Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets: news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.

Title:
Error Propagation in Dynamic Programming: From Stochastic Control to Option Pricing
Andrea Della Vecchia, Damir Filipović
Subjects:
Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Finance (q-fin.CP); Pricing of Securities (q-fin.PR); Applications (stat.AP)
This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.

Title:
Optimizing Economic Complexity
Viktor Stojkoski, César A. Hidalgo
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Efforts to apply economic complexity to identify diversification opportunities often rely on diagrams comparing the relatedness and complexity or products, technologies, or industries. Yer, the use of these diagrams is not based on empirical or theoretidal evidence supporting some notion of optimality. Here, we introduce an optimization-based framework that identifies diversification opportunities by minimizing a cost function capturing the constraints imposed by an economy's pattern of specialization. We show that the resulting portfolios often differ from those implied by relatedness-complexity diagrams, providing a target-oriented optimization layer to the economic complexity toolkit.

Title:
Decentralised Multi-Manager Fund Framework
Arman Abgaryan, Utkarsh Sharma, Joshua Tobkin
Subjects:
General Finance (q-fin.GN)
We introduce a decentralised, algorithmic framework for permissionless, multi-strategy capital allocation via tokenised, automated vaults. The system is designed to function analogously to a multi-strategy asset management company, but implemented entirely on-chain through a modular architecture comprising four interacting layers. The first, the capitalisation layer, composed of vaults that facilitate multi-asset deposits, tokenises investor participation, and specifies high level risk limits and admissible venues for deployment. The second, the strategy layer, enables the submission of strategies by human developers or autonomous agents, creating a decentralised marketplace governed by a validation mechanism incorporating adversarial and gamified elements. The third, the execution layer, operationalises strategy deployment using the host blockchain network's services. The fourth layer, the validated allocation layer, assesses and allocates capital among validated strategies, dynamically rebalancing toward those exhibiting superior risk-adjusted performance. In the framework, each admitted strategy acts as a manager for the "fund", encapsulated in a smart contract vault that issues transferable V-Tokens, conveying fractional ownership of the real-time portfolio operated by the vault. The system is designed to be open to participation by both human and AI agents, who collectively perform the roles of capital allocators, strategy developers, and validated allocators. The resulting structure is a self-regulating asset management ecosystem capable of decentralised, cooperative optimisation across traditional and digital financial domains. This framework is facilitated by a host chain network, which offers native automation and data oracle services enabling vault entities to autonomously operate on-chain, paving the way for being self sufficient in dynamic allocation of capital.

Title:
Comrades and Cause: Peer Influence on West Point Cadets' Civil War Allegiances
Yuchen Guo, Matthew O. Jackson, Ruixue Jia
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Do social networks and peer influence shape major life decisions in highly polarized settings? We explore this question by examining how peers influenced the allegiances of West Point cadets during the American Civil War. Leveraging quasi-random variations in the proportion of cadets from Free States, we analyze how these differences affected cadets' decisions about which army to join. We have four main findings. First, there was a strong and significant peer effect: a higher proportion of classmates from Free States significantly increased the likelihood that cadets from Slave States joined the Union Army. Second, the peer effect interacted with geography and economic circumstances: almost all cadets from Free States joined the Union Army (if they decided to join the war), and most cadets from Slave States that had more than a third of their population in slavery joined the Confederacy. The cadets who were most highly influenced were from Slave States that had less than a third of their population in slavery. Third, we analyze how cadets' decisions affected their military rank and career outcomes. Fourth, we show that having served together in the Mexican-American war increased the peer influence, providing additional evidence that peer interaction was influential.

Title:
An Ambit Field Framework for the Full Panel of Day-ahead Electricity Prices
Thomas K. Kloster
Comments:
Added affiliations. Corrected a typo + proposition 3.2 and 3.3
Subjects:
Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF)
This paper considers the often overlooked fact that electricity spot prices in individual European generation zones evolve as a high dimensional panel structure. A general continuous time framework is developed by formulating the panel as an ambit field indexed by a cylinder surface, where the cross sectional dimension is represented by a circle. This requires a treatment of ambit fields on manifolds, but the departure from Euclidean space allows for embedding intrinsic dependence structures into the index set in a flexible and parameter-free way, where the daily delivery periods have a canonical mapping onto the circle. The model is a natural space-time extension of volatility modulated Lévy-driven Volterra processes, which have previously been studied in the context of energy markets, and the pricing of electricity derivatives turns out to be essentially as analytically tractable as in the null-spatial setting. The space-time framework extends the scope of possible derivatives to products written on individual delivery periods, where spreads between these constitute an interesting example. We establish useful formulas for the pricing of various derivatives along with a simulation scheme, and study specifications of the dependence structure in detail.

Title:
Rethinking Beta: A Causal Take on CAPM
Naftali Cohen
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH); Pricing of Securities (q-fin.PR); Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST); Applications (stat.AP)
The CAPM regression is typically interpreted as if the market return contemporaneously \emph{causes} individual returns, motivating beta-neutral portfolios and factor attribution. For realized equity returns, however, this interpretation is inconsistent: a same-period arrow $R_{m,t} \to R_{i,t}$ conflicts with the fact that $R_m$ is itself a value-weighted aggregate of its constituents, unless $R_m$ is lagged or leave-one-out -- the ``aggregator contradiction.'' We formalize CAPM as a structural causal model and analyze the admissible three-node graphs linking an external driver $Z$, the market $R_m$, and an asset $R_i$. The empirically plausible baseline is a \emph{fork}, $Z \to \{R_m, R_i\}$, not $R_m \to R_i$. In this setting, OLS beta reflects not a causal transmission, but an attenuated proxy for how well $R_m$ captures the underlying driver $Z$. Consequently, ``beta-neutral'' portfolios can remain exposed to macro or sectoral shocks, and hedging on $R_m$ can import index-specific noise. Using stylized models and large-cap U.S.\ equity data, we show that contemporaneous betas act like proxies rather than mechanisms; any genuine market-to-stock channel, if at all, appears only at a lag and with modest economic significance. The practical message is clear: CAPM should be read as associational. Risk management and attribution should shift from fixed factor menus to explicitly declared causal paths, with ``alpha'' reserved for what remains invariant once those causal paths are explicitly blocked.
