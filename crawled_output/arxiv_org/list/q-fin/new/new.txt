Title:
Maximum principle for robust utility optimization via Tsallis relative entropy
Xueying Huang, Peng Luo, Dejian Tian

Subjects:
Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF)
This paper investigates an optimal consumption-investment problem featuring recursive utility via Tsallis relative entropy. We establish a fundamental connection between this optimization problem and a quadratic backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), demonstrating that the value function is the value process of the solution to this BSDE. Utilizing advanced BSDE techniques, we derive a novel stochastic maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for both the optimal consumption process and terminal wealth. Furthermore, we prove the existence of optimal strategy and analyze the coupled forward-backward system arising from the optimization problem.

Title:
Multivariate Quadratic Hawkes Processes -- Part II: Non-Parametric Empirical Calibration
Cecilia Aubrun, Michael Benzaquen, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Subjects:
Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR); General Finance (q-fin.GN)
This is the second part of our work on Multivariate Quadratic Hawkes (MQHawkes) Processes, devoted to the calibration of the model defined and studied analytically in Aubrun, C., Benzaquen, M., & Bouchaud, J. P., Quantitative Finance, 23(5), 741-758 (2023). We propose a non-parametric calibration method based on the general method of moments applied to a coarse-grained version of the MQHawkes model. This allows us to bypass challenges inherent to tick by tick data. Our main methodological innovation is a multi-step calibration procedure, first focusing on ''self'' feedback kernels, and then progressively including cross-effects. Indeed, while cross-effects are significant and interpretable, they are usually one order of magnitude smaller than self-effects, and must therefore be disentangled from noise with care. For numerical stability, we also restrict to pair interactions and only calibrate bi-variate QHawkes, neglecting higher-order interactions. Our main findings are: (a) While cross-Hawkes feedback effects have been empirically studied previously, cross-Zumbach effects are clearly identified here for the first time. The effect of recent trends of the E-Mini futures contract onto the volatility of other futures contracts is especially strong; (b) We have identified a new type of feedback that couples past realized covariance between two assets and future volatility of these two assets, with the pair E-Mini vs TBOND as a case in point; (c) A cross-leverage effect, whereby the sign of the return of one asset impacts the volatility of another asset, is also clearly identified. The cross-leverage effect between the E-Mini and the residual volatility of single stocks is notable, and surprisingly universal across the universe of stocks that we considered.

Title:
Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities
Shanjukta Nath, Jiwon Hong, Jae Ho Chang, Keith Warren, Subhadeep Paul
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Economics (econ.GN); Methodology (stat.ME)
We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks, multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction and feedback.

Title:
Two-fund separation under hyperbolically distributed returns and concave utility functions
Nuerxiati Abudurexiti, Erhan Bayraktar, Takaki Hayashi, Hasanjan Sayit
Subjects:
Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM)
Portfolio selection problems that optimize expected utility are usually difficult to solve. If the number of assets in the portfolio is large, such expected utility maximization problems become even harder to solve numerically. Therefore, analytical expressions for optimal portfolios are always preferred. In our work, we study portfolio optimization problems under the expected utility criterion for a wide range of utility functions, assuming return vectors follow hyperbolic distributions. Our main result demonstrates that under this setup, the two-fund monetary separation holds. Specifically, an individual with any utility function from this broad class will always choose to hold the same portfolio of risky assets, only adjusting the mix between this portfolio and a riskless asset based on their initial wealth and the specific utility function used for decision making. We provide explicit expressions for this mutual fund of risky assets. As a result, in our economic model, an individual's optimal portfolio is expressed in closed form as a linear combination of the riskless asset and the mutual fund of risky assets. Additionally, we discuss expected utility maximization problems under exponential utility functions over any domain of the portfolio set. In this part of our work, we show that the optimal portfolio in any given convex domain of the portfolio set either lies on the boundary of the domain or is the unique globally optimal portfolio within the entire domain.

Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: this https URL.

Title:
Interpreting the Interpreter: Can We Model post-ECB Conferences Volatility with LLM Agents?
Umberto Collodel
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper develops a novel method to simulate financial market reactions to European Central Bank (ECB) press conferences using Large Language Models (LLMs). We create a behavioral, agent-based simulation of 30 synthetic traders, each with distinct risk preferences, cognitive biases, and interpretive styles. These agents interpret ECB communication and forecast Euro interest rate swap levels at 3-month, 2-year, and 10-year maturities, with cross-sectional variation serving as a measure of market uncertainty. Using a comprehensive dataset of 283 ECB press conferences (1998-2025), we evaluate three prompting strategies: naive zero-shot, few-shot (enriched with historical context), and an advanced iterative 'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework. We find that even the naive approach achieves substantial correlations (roughly 0.5) between synthetic disagreement and actual post-announcement OIS volatility, particularly for medium- and long-term maturities. The 'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework further enhances performance upon initial application, reaching correlations of almost 0.6 and identifying key drivers of volatility. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based agents can effectively capture the heterogeneous interpretive processes through which monetary policy signals propagate to financial markets, moving beyond traditional reduced-form event studies. This provides central banks with a practical tool to ex-ante evaluate communication strategies and anticipate market reactions, while offering researchers a micro-founded framework for understanding expectation formation in response to central bank communication.

Title:
There must be an error here! Experimental evidence on coding errors' biases
Bruno Ferman, Lucas Finamor
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Quantitative research relies heavily on coding, and coding errors are relatively common even in published research. In this paper, we examine whether individuals are more or less likely to check their code depending on the results they obtain. We test this hypothesis in a randomized experiment embedded in the recruitment process for research positions at a large international economic organization. In a coding task designed to assess candidates' programming abilities, we randomize whether participants obtain an expected or unexpected result if they commit a simple coding error. We find that individuals are almost 20% more likely to detect coding errors when they lead to unexpected results. This asymmetry in error detection depending on the results they generate suggests that coding errors may lead to biased findings in scientific research.

Title:
Demand and consumer surplus in the payday-loan market: Evidence from British Columbia
Tim Zhang, Amity Quinn
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This study examines how interest rate caps affect the demand for payday loans, using aggregate data from British Columbia (2012--2019) during which the province's maximum fee was reduced from \$23 to \$17 and then to \$15 per \$100 borrowed. Estimating a linear demand function via OLS, we find that lowering interest rate caps significantly increases loan demand. We estimate that the \$8 decrease, from \$23 to \$15 per \$100, raised annual consumer surplus by roughly \$28.6 million (2012 CAD). A further reduction to \$14, starting in January 2025, would add another \$3.9 million per year. These results suggest that stricter interest rate caps can yield substantial consumer welfare gains.

Title:
An Efficient Multi-scale Leverage Effect Estimator under Dependent Microstructure Noise
Ziyang Xiong, Zhao Chen, Christina Dan Wang
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)
Estimating the leverage effect from high-frequency data is vital but challenged by complex, dependent microstructure noise, often exhibiting non-Gaussian higher-order moments. This paper introduces a novel multi-scale framework for efficient and robust leverage effect estimation under such flexible noise structures. We develop two new estimators, the Subsampling-and-Averaging Leverage Effect (SALE) and the Multi-Scale Leverage Effect (MSLE), which adapt subsampling and multi-scale approaches holistically using a unique shifted window technique. This design simplifies the multi-scale estimation procedure and enhances noise robustness without requiring the pre-averaging approach. We establish central limit theorems and stable convergence, with MSLE achieving convergence rates of an optimal $n^{-1/4}$ and a near-optimal $n^{-1/9}$ for the noise-free and noisy settings, respectively. A cornerstone of our framework's efficiency is a specifically designed MSLE weighting strategy that leverages covariance structures across scales. This significantly reduces asymptotic variance and, critically, yields substantially smaller finite-sample errors than existing methods under both noise-free and realistic noisy settings. Extensive simulations and empirical analyses confirm the superior efficiency, robustness, and practical advantages of our approach.
