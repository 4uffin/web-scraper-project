Title:
Pareto-optimal Tradeoffs Between Communication and Computation with Flexible Gradient Tracking

This paper addresses distributed optimization problems in non-i.i.d. scenarios, focusing on the interplay between communication and computation efficiency. To this end, we propose FlexGT, a flexible snapshot gradient tracking method with tunable numbers of local updates and neighboring communications in each round. Leveraging a unified convergence analysis framework, we prove that FlexGT achieves a linear or sublinear convergence rate depending on objective-specific properties--from (strongly) convex to nonconvex--and the above-mentioned tunable parameters. FlexGT is provably robust to the heterogeneity across nodes and attains the best-known communication and computation complexity among existing results. Moreover, we introduce an accelerated gossip-based variant, termed Acc-FlexGT, and show that with prior knowledge of the graph, it achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between communication and computation. Particularly, Acc-FlexGT achieves the optimal iteration complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( L/\epsilon +L\sigma ^2/\left( n\epsilon^2 \sqrt{1-\sqrt{\rho _W}} \right) \right) $ for the nonconvex case, matching the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor, and improves the existing results for the strongly convex case by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( 1/\sqrt{\epsilon} \right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the targeted accuracy, $n$ the number of nodes, $L$ the Lipschitz constant, $\rho_W$ the spectrum gap of the graph, and $\sigma$ the stochastic gradient variance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Title:
Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode

Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title:
Counting Degrees of Freedom: A Method Applicable from Scalars to f(Q) Gravity and Beyond
Lavinia Heisenberg
Comments:
130 pages, 5 figures. Any comments are welcome
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We present a clear, step-by-step method for counting degrees of freedom and identifying constraints in general field theories. This approach, grounded in the works of Einstein, Hilbert, Cartan, Kuranishi, and, more recently, Seiler, is neither Lagrangian nor Hamiltonian in nature. Instead, it applies directly to the field equations. We offer a transparent physical interpretation of the method, establish new results, and explore a broad set of examples to demonstrate its power and generality. Notably, we apply the method to $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where traditional techniques such as the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm are ineffective, and obtain seven propagating degrees of freedom.

Title:
Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Absolute Monotonicity of Functions Related to Gaussian Hypergeometric Functions
Tiehong Zhao
Comments:
20pages
Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
This paper systematically investigates the absolute monotonicity of two function families associated with the Gaussian hypergeometric function $F(a, b; c; x)$ (where $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}_+$): $\mathcal{F}_p(x)=(1-x)^pF(a,b;c;x)$ and $\mathcal{G}_p(x)=(1-x)^p \exp(F(a,b;c;x))$, as well as the logarithmic transform $\ln\mathcal{F}_p(x)$. Our primary goal is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the parameter $p$ such that $-\mathcal{F}'_p$, $\pm\mathcal{G}'_p$ and $\pm(\ln\mathcal{F}_p)'$ are absolutely monotonic on $(0,1)$. Additionally, we derive several results regarding the absolute monotonicity of their higher-order derivatives. As applications, we derive several new inequalities for the Gaussian hypergeometric function $F(a,b;c;x)$. Most importantly, we develop a novel constructive approach based on Jurkat's criterion for power series ratios, which avoids limitations of cumbersome recursive/inductive methods in existing literature.

Sampling-Based Zero-Order Optimization Algorithms
Xicheng Zhang
Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Probability (math.PR)
We propose a novel zeroth-order optimization algorithm based on an efficient sampling strategy. Under mild global regularity conditions on the objective function, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the proposed method. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, highlighting three key attributes: (i) Scalability: consistent performance in high-dimensional settings (exceeding 100 dimensions); (ii) Versatility: robust convergence across a diverse suite of benchmark functions, including Schwefel, Rosenbrock, Ackley, Griewank, Lévy, Rastrigin, and Weierstrass; and (iii) Robustness to discontinuities: reliable performance on non-smooth and discontinuous landscapes. These results illustrate the method's strong potential for black-box optimization in complex, real-world scenarios.

For $0< \rho < 1/3$ and $\rho \le \lambda \le 1-2\rho$, let $E$ be the self-similar set generated by the iterated function system $$\Phi = \big\{ \varphi_1(x) = \rho x ,\; \varphi_2(x) = \rho x + \lambda, \; \varphi_3(x) = \rho x + 1- \rho \big\}.$$ All contractive similitudes $f$ with $f(E) \subset E$ are characterized: one can find $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_n \in \{1,2,3\}$ such that \[ f(E)=\varphi_{i_1} \circ \varphi_{i_2} \circ \cdots \circ \varphi_{i_n} (E). \]

Title:
On the uniqueness of the discrete Calderon problem on multi-dimensional lattices
Maolin Deng, Bangti Jin
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we investigate the discrete Calderón problem on grid graphs of dimension three or higher, formed by hypercubic structures. The discrete Calderón problem is concerned with determining whether the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator, which links boundary potentials to boundary current responses, can uniquely identify the conductivity values on the graph edges. We provide an affirmative answer to the question, thereby extending the classical uniqueness result of Curtis and Morrow for two-dimensional square lattices. The proof employs a novel slicing technique that decomposes the problem into lower-dimensional components. Additionally, we support the theoretical finding with numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Title:
A Sequential Testing Problem with Signal Control
Steven Campbell, Georgy Gaitsgori, Richard Groenewald
Comments:
28 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Probability (math.PR)
We study a controlled version of the Bayesian sequential testing problem for the drift of a Wiener process, in which the observer exercises discretion over the signal intensity. This control incurs a running cost that reflects the resource demands of information acquisition. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, combining both the expenditure on control and the loss from misclassifying the unknown drift. By allowing for a general class of loss functions and any measurable cost of control, our analysis captures a broad range of sequential inference problems. We show that when a function, determined by the cost structure, admits a global minimizer, the optimal control is constant and explicitly computable, thereby reducing our setting to a solvable optimal stopping problem. If no such minimizer exists, an optimal control does not exist either, yet the value function remains explicit. Our results thus demonstrate that full tractability can be retained even when extending sequential inference to include endogenous control over the information flow.

Title:
Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization in WSNs with Distributed Scaled Proximal ADMM Algorithms
Qiaojia Zhu, Xiaojing Shen, Haiqi Liu, Pramod K. Varshney
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Cooperative and non-cooperative localization frequently arise together in wireless sensor networks, particularly when sensor positions are uncertain and targets are unable to communicate with the network. While joint processing can eliminate the delay in target estimation found in sequential approaches, it introduces complex variable coupling, posing challenges in both modeling and optimization. This paper presents a joint modeling approach that formulates cooperative and non-cooperative localization as a single optimization problem. To address the resulting coupling, we introduce auxiliary variables that enable structural decoupling and distributed computation. Building on this formulation, we develop the Scaled Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Joint Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization (SP-ADMM-JCNL). Leveraging the problem's structured design, we provide theoretical guarantees that the algorithm generates a sequence converging globally to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the reformulated problem and further to a critical point of the original non-convex objective function, with a sublinear rate of O(1/T). Experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that SP-ADMM-JCNL achieves accurate and reliable localization performance.

An Inductive Proof that Lights Out Configurations are Invertible
Keivan Mirzaei
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We give an elementary inductive proof of a classical result for the \emph{Lights Out problem} on graphs: from any configuration of vertices, one can reach the complementary configuration by a sequence of moves, where a move consists of toggling a vertex and its neighbors. Unlike the usual linear-algebraic approach over $\mathbb{F}_2$, our argument is purely combinatorial.

We prove an integral version of the derived Springer correspondence for reduced motives. To achieve this result, we extend some results on reduced motives from schemes to quotient stacks with a finite number of orbits. More generally, we work in the context of the Springer setup, as defined by Eberhardt and Stroppel, which has also applications for quiver Hecke algebras.

We construct the Chow weight structure on a full subcategory of the category of $\mathrm{K}$-motives over a tame quotient stack in characteristic zero as defined by Hoyois. We also prove that in a quite general case, this full subcategory is exactly the category of geometric $\mathrm{K}$-motives. We apply this to give a partial Springer decomposition in the context of $\mathrm{K}$-motives.

Multipliers on Spaces of Holomorphic Functions on Runge Domains in $\mathbb{C}^n
Maria Trybuła
Comments:

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Complex Variables (math.CV)
We investigate multipliers on the space of holomorphic functions $H(\Omega)$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ is an open set. For Runge domains, we characterize these multipliers as convolutions with analytic functionals. Additionally, we explore Cartesian product domains, providing a representation of multipliers through germs of holomorphic functions. Finally, we identify the appropriate topology for analytic functionals, establishing a topological isomorphism with multipliers by utilizing the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets inherited from the space of endomorphisms on $H(\Omega)$.

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Category Theory (math.CT); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
In this paper we study triangular matrix categories using the theory of recollements of abelian categories. Given a triangular matrix category we construct two canonical recollements. We show that if certain funtors of these recollements are exact then the category appearing in the middle term is actually a triangular matrix category. This result is a generalization of one given by Liping Li in \cite{LipingLi}. We also show that if $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathcal{C})$ admits a nontrivial torsion pair by abelian categories then $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to a triangular matrix category.

Representation of Operators on Spaces of Holomorphic Functions in $\mathbb{C}^n$
Maria Trybuła
Comments:
10 pages
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Complex Variables (math.CV)
We investigate operators between spaces of holomorphic functions in several complex variables. Let $G_1, G_2 \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ be cylindrical domains. We construct a canonical map from the space of bounded linear operators $\mathcal{L}(H(G_1), H(G_2))$ to $H(G_1^b \times G_2)$ and prove that it is a topological isomorphism (Theorem~\ref{pierwsze twierdzenie}). We then establish uniform estimates for operators on bounded, complete $n$-circled domains (Theorem~\ref{thm:4.8}) and show that sequences of operators on smaller domains satisfying suitable uniform bounds uniquely determine a global operator (Theorem~\ref{thm:4.9}). Together, these results provide a unified framework for representing and extending operators on spaces of holomorphic functions in several complex variables.

Graph enumeration for moduli spaces of curves and maps
Siddarth Kannan, Terry Dekun Song
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the Pólya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches Pólya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.

Convergence, Duality and Well-Posedness in Convex Bilevel Optimization
Khanh-Hung Giang-Tran, Nam Ho-Nguyen, Fatma Kılınç-Karzan, Lingqing Shen
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We consider the convex bilevel optimization problem, also known as simple bilevel programming. There are two challenges in solving convex bilevel optimization problems. Firstly, strong duality is not guaranteed due to the lack of Slater constraint qualification. Secondly, we demonstrate through an example that convergence of algorithms is not guaranteed even when usual subotimality gap bounds are present, due to the possibility of encountering super-optimal solutions. We show that strong duality (but not necessarily dual solvability) is exactly equivalent to ensuring correct asymptotic convergence of both inner and outer function values, and provide a simple condition that guarantees strong duality. Unfortunately, we also show that this simple condition is not sufficient to guarantee convergence to the optimal solution set. We draw connections to Levitin-Polyak well-posedness, and leverage this together with our strong duality equivalence to provide another condition that ensures convergence to the optimal solution set. We also discuss how our conditions have been implicitly present in existing algorithmic work.

Lorantzian trans-Sasakian space form is a special type of space form in which the nature of even and odd dimensional space form both exist. Various curvature tensors with respect to Levi-Civita connection on the space form are derived in this paper. We have shown that if an odd-dimensional Lorentzian trans-Sasakian space form admits a hyperbolic Ricci soliton and hyperbolic conformal Ricci soliton then they will be ${\eta}$-Einstein. We also obtained the conditions for the solitons to be expanding, steady or shrinking. Finally, an example has been constructed which justifies the results obtained.

A mixed formulation for the fractional Poisson problem
Juan Pablo Borthagaray, Nahuel de León
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The mixed formulation of the classical Poisson problem introduces the flux as an additional variable, leading to a system of coupled equations. Using fractional calculus identities, in this work we explore a mixed formulation of the fractional Poisson problem and establish its well-posedness. Since a direct discretization of this problem appears to be out of reach, we adapt a stabilized approach by Hughes and Masud, which yields a coercive and well-posed formulation. The coercivity ensures the stability of any conforming finite element discretization. We further prove the convergence of this discretization, derive convergence rates, and discuss implementation aspects. Finally, we present numerical experiments that highlight both the importance of stabilization and the accuracy of our theoretical results.

We study compact locally conformally Kähler (lcK) manifolds which are Calabi-Yau, in the sense that $c_1^{BC}(X)=0$. We prove that an lcK Gauduchon metric that is Chern-Ricci flat is necessarily Vaisman. Specializing to Calabi--Yau solvmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure, we prove that a left-invariant metric is lcK if and only if it is Vaisman. Therefore, they are finite quotients of the Kodaira manifold.

Bounded ribbonlength for knot families and multi-twist Möbius bands
Elizabeth Denne, Timi Patterson
Comments:
30 pages, 24 figures
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Take a thin, rectangular strip of paper, add in an odd number of half-twists, then join the ends together. This gives a multi-twist paper Möbius band. We prove that any multi-twist paper Möbius band can be constructed so the aspect ratio of the rectangle is $3\sqrt{3}+\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon>0$. We could also take the thin, rectangular strip of paper and tie a knot in it, then join the ends and fold flat in the plane. This creates a folded ribbon knot. We apply the techniques used to prove the multi-twist paper Möbius band result to $(2,q)$ torus knots and twist knots. We prove that any $(2,q)$-torus knot can be constructed so that the folded ribbonlength $\leq 13.86$. We prove that any twist knot can be constructed so that the folded ribbonlength is $\leq 17.59$. Both of these results give the lower bound for the ribbonlength crossing number problem which relates the infimal folded ribbonlength of a knot type $[K]$ to its crossing number $\text{Cr}(K)$. That is, we have shown $\alpha=0$ in the equation $c\cdot \text{Cr}(K)^\alpha \leq \text{Rib}([K])$, where $c$ is a constant.

We prove that the bundles with flat connections on configuration spaces associated to braided fusion categories, as well as the bundles with flat connections on moduli spaces of curves (conformal blocks) associated to modular fusion categories, are defined over number fields. The proof relies on Ocneanu rigidity. This result answers a conjecture of Etingof and Varchenko. Furthermore, we show that for a fixed braided or modular category, all the associated bundles with flat connections and their compatibilities (i.e., the braided or modular functor) can be defined over the same number field.

Zero-Shot Transferable Solution Method for Parametric Optimal Control Problems
Xingjian Li, Kelvin Kan, Deepanshu Verma, Krishna Kumar, Stanley Osher, Ján Drgoňa
Comments:
8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
This paper presents a transferable solution method for optimal control problems with varying objectives using function encoder (FE) policies. Traditional optimization-based approaches must be re-solved whenever objectives change, resulting in prohibitive computational costs for applications requiring frequent evaluation and adaptation. The proposed method learns a reusable set of neural basis functions that spans the control policy space, enabling efficient zero-shot adaptation to new tasks through either projection from data or direct mapping from problem specifications. The key idea is an offline-online decomposition: basis functions are learned once during offline imitation learning, while online adaptation requires only lightweight coefficient estimation. Numerical experiments across diverse dynamics, dimensions, and cost structures show our method delivers near-optimal performance with minimal overhead when generalizing across tasks, enabling semi-global feedback policies suitable for real-time deployment.

Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories
Robin Cockett, Florian Schwarz
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are Étale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.

Graph entropy, degree assortativity, and hierarchical structures in networks
Fatihcan M. Atay, Türker Bıyıkoğlu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
We connect several notions relating the structural and dynamical properties of a graph. Among them are the topological entropy coming from the vertex shift, which is related to the spectral radius of the graph's adjacency matrix, the Randić index, and the degree assortativity. We show that, among all connected graphs with the same degree sequence, the graph having maximum entropy is characterized by a hierarchical structure; namely, it satisfies a breadth-first search ordering with decreasing degrees (BFD-ordering for short). Consequently, the maximum-entropy graph necessarily has high degree assortativity; furthermore, for such a graph the degree centrality and eigenvector centrality coincide. Moreover, the notion of assortativity is related to the general Randić index. We prove that the graph that maximizes the Randić index satisfies a BFD-ordering. For trees, the converse holds as well. We also define a normalized Randić function and show that its maximum value equals the difference of Shannon entropies of two probability distributions defined on the edges and vertices of the graph based on degree correlations.

We prove the well-posedness and regularity of solutions in mixed-norm weighted Sobolev spaces for a class of second-order parabolic and elliptic systems in divergence form in the half-space $\mathbb{R}^d_+ = \{x_d > 0\}$ subject to the conormal boundary condition. Our work extends results previously available for scalar equations to the case of systems of equations. The leading coefficients are the product of $x_d^{\alpha}$ and bounded non-degenerate matrices, where $\alpha \in (-1,\infty)$. The leading coefficients are assumed to be merely measurable in the $x_d$ variable, and to have small mean oscillations in small cylinders with respect to the other variables. Our results hold for systems with lower-order terms that may blow-up near the boundary.

ff-bifbox: A scalable, open-source toolbox for bifurcation analysis of nonlinear PDEs
Christopher M. Douglas, Pierre Jolivet
Comments:

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Nonlinear PDEs give rise to complex dynamics that are often difficult to analyze in state space due to their relatively large numbers of degrees of freedom, ill-conditioned operators, and changing spatial and parameter resolution requirements. This work introduces ff-bifbox: a new open-source toolbox for performing numerical branch tracing, stability/bifurcation analysis, resolvent analysis, and time integration of large, time-dependent nonlinear PDEs discretized on adaptively refined meshes in two and three spatial dimensions. Spatial discretization is handled using finite elements in FreeFEM, with the discretized operators manipulated in a distributed framework via PETSc. Following a summary of the underlying theory and numerics, results from three examples are presented to validate the implementation and demonstrate its capabilities. The considered examples, which are provided with runnable ff-bifbox code, include: a 3-D Brusselator system, a 3-D plate buckling system, and a 2-D compressible Navier--Stokes system. In addition to reproducing results from prior studies, novel results are presented for each system.

On the problem of filling by a Poincaré-Einstein metric in dimension 4
Sun-Yung Alice Chang, Yuxin Ge
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Given a metric defined on a manifold of dimension three, we study the problem of finding a conformal filling by a Poincaré-Einstein metric on a manifold of dimension four. We establish a compactness result for classes of conformally compact Einstein $4$-manifolds under conformally invariant conditions. A key step in the proof is a result of rigidity for the hyperbolic metric on $\mathbb {B}^4$ or $ S^1 \times \mathbb{B}^3$.
As an application, we also derive some existence results of conformal filling in for metrics in a definite size neighborhood of the canonical metric; when the conformal infinity is either $S^3$ or $S^1 \times S^2$.

An alternative construction of character sheaves on parahoric subgroups
Alexander B. Ivanov, Sian Nie, Zhihang Yu
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Inspired by the foundational work of Bezrukavnikov and Chan \cite{BC24} on character sheaves for parahoric subgroups and an alternative interpretation of deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters in \cite{Nie_24}, we present a parallel but closed (non-iterated) construction of character sheaves within the framework of J.--K. Yu's types. We show that our construction yields perverse sheaves, which coincide with those produced in \cite{BC24} in an iterated way. In the regular case we establish the compatibility of their Frobenius traces with deep level Deligne-Lusztig characters. As an application, we prove the positive-depth Springer's hypothesis for arbitrary characters, thereby generalizing the generic case result of Chan and Oi \cite{CO25}. The proofs of our results make critical use of the strategies and results from \cite{BC24} and \cite{Nie_24}.

A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant
Dror Bar-Natan, Roland van der Veen
Comments:

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
* Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
* Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
* Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
* Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
$\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta is$ almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.

Universal perspectives on irredundance for X-set parameters
Bryan Curtis, Mary Flagg, Leslie Hogben
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Universal definitions of irredundance for X-set parameters are presented using blocking sets. This approach is modeled on (domination) irredundance (which uses closed neighborhoods as blocking sets) and zero forcing irredundance (which uses forts). Results include a chain of inequalities between irredundance parameters and original parameters and the isomorphism theorem for TAR reconfiguration graphs of many irredundance parameters. These results are then applied to PSD forcing irredundance and vertex cover irredundance; the chain of inequalities also applies to skew forcing irredundance. The upper vertex cover irredundance number becomes part of the Domination Chain used in the study of (domination) irredundance. Based on the propagation processes involved in forcing, an alternate universal theory of irredundance is developed using closure operators.

Integrated Prediction and Distributionally Robust Optimization for Air Traffic Management
Haochen Wu, Xinting Zhu, Lishuai Li, Max Z. Li
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Strategic Traffic Management Initiatives (TMIs) such as Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) play a crucial role in mitigating operational costs associated with air traf- fic demand-capacity imbalances. However, GDPs can only be planned (e.g., duration, delay assignments) with confidence if the future capacities at constrained re- sources (i.e., airports) are predictable. In reality, such future capacities are uncer- tain, and predictive models may provide predictions that are vulnerable to errors and distribution shifts. Motivated by the goal of planning optimal GDPs that are distributionally robust against airport capacity prediction errors, we study a fully integrated learning-driven optimization framework. We design a deep learning- based prediction model capable of forecasting arrival and departure capacity distributions across a network of airports. We incorporate the predictions into a distributionally robust formulation of the multi-airport ground holding program (DR- MAGHP). Our results demonstrate that DR-MAGHP can achieve up to a 15.6% improvement over the stochastic programming formulation (SP-MAGHP) under airport capacity distribution shifts. We conclude by outlining future research di- rections aimed at enhancing both the learning and optimization components of the framework.

Optimization-Guided Exploration of Advanced Air Mobility Congestion Management Strategies with Stochastic Demands

Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) represents an evolution of the air transportation system by introducing low-altitude, potentially high-traffic environments. AAM operations will be enabled by both new aircraft, as well as new safety- and efficiency-critical supporting infrastructure. Published concepts of operations from both public and private sector entities establish notions such as federated management of the airspace and public-private partnerships for AAM air traffic, but there is a gap in the literature in terms of integrated tools that consider all three critical elements: AAM fleet operators (\emph{lower} layer), airspace service providers (\emph{middle} layer), and overall system governance from the legacy air navigation service provider (\emph{upper} layer). In this work, we explore modeling congestion management within the AAM setting using a bi-level optimization approach, focusing on (1) time-varying, stochastic AAM demand, (2) differing congestion management strategies, and (3) the impact of unscheduled, \enquote{pop-up} demand. We show that our bi-level formulation can be tractably solved using a Neural Network-based surrogate which returns solution qualities within 0.1-5.2\% of the optimal solution. Additionally, we show that our congestion management strategies can reduce congestion by 25.7-39.8\% when compared to the scenario of no strategies being applied. Finally, we also show that while pop-up demand degrades congestion conditions, our congestion management strategies fare better against pop-up demand than the no strategy scenario. The work herein contributes a rigorous modeling and simulation tool to help evaluate future AAM traffic management concepts and strategies.

CaCuTe: Casual Cubic-Model Technique for Faster Optimization
Nazarii Tupitsa
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We establish a local $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rate for the gradient update $x^{k+1}=x^k-\nabla f(x^k)/\sqrt{H\|\nabla f(x^k)\|}$ under a $2H$-Hessian--Lipschitz assumption. Regime detection relies on Hessian--vector products, avoiding Hessian formation or factorization. Incorporating this certificate into cubic-regularized Newton (CRN) and an accelerated variant enables per-iterate switching between the cubic and gradient steps while preserving CRN's global guarantees. The technique achieves the lowest wall-clock time among compared baselines in our experiments. In the first-order setting, the technique yields a monotone, adaptive, parameter-free method that inherits the local $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rate. Despite backtracking, the method shows superior wall-clock performance. Additionally, we cover smoothness relaxations beyond classical gradient--Lipschitzness, enabling tighter bounds, including global $\mathcal{O}(k^{-2})$ rates. Finally, we generalize the technique to the stochastic setting.

Cops and robbers is a pursuit-evasion game played on graphs. We completely classify the cop numbers for $n \times n$ knight graphs and queen graphs. This completes the classification of the cop numbers for all $n \times n$ classical chess graphs. As a corollary, we resolve an open problem about the monotonicity of $c$($\mathcal{Q}_n$). Moreover, we introduce \emph{royal graphs}, a generalization of chess graphs for arbitrary piece movements, which models real-life movement constraints. We give results on the cop numbers for these families.

Functional Information Decomposition: A First-Principles Approach to Analyzing Functional Relationships
Clifford Bohm, Vincent R. Ragusa, Arend Hintze, Christoph Adami
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Information theory, originating from Shannon's work on communication systems, has become a fundamental tool across neuroscience, genetics, physics, and machine learning. However, the application of information theory is often limited to the simplest case: mutual information between two variables. A central challenge in extending information theory to multivariate systems is decomposition: understanding how the information that multiple variables collectively provide about a target can be broken down into the distinct contributions that are assignable to individual variables or their interactions. To restate the problem clearly, what is sought after is a decomposition of the mutual information between a set of inputs (or parts) and an output (or whole). In this work, we introduce Functional Information Decomposition (FID) a new approach to information decomposition that differs from prior methods by operating on complete functional relationships rather than statistical correlations, enabling precise quantification of independent and synergistic contributions.

Strong chordality in tournaments and multipartite tournaments with possible loops

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Strongly chordal digraphs are included in the class of chordal digraphs and generalize strongly chordal graphs and chordal bipartite graphs. They are the digraphs that admit a linear ordering of its vertex set for which their adjacency matrix does not contain the $\Gamma$ matrix as a submatrix. In general, it is not clear if these digraphs can be recognized in polynomial time. We focus on multipartite tournaments with possible loops. We give a polynomial-time recognition algorithm and a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of the strong chordality for each of the following cases: tournaments with possible loops, reflexive multipartite tournaments, irreflexive bipartite tournaments, irreflexive tournaments minus one arc, and balanced digraphs.
In addition, we prove that in a strongly chordal digraph the minimum size of a total dominating set equals the maximum number of disjoint in-neighborhoods, and this number can be calculated in linear time given a $\Gamma$-free ordering of the input graph.

A new cross approximation for Tucker tensors and its application in Tucker-Anderson Acceleration
Daniel Appelö, Yingda Cheng
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper proposes two new algorithms related to the Tucker tensor format. The first method is a new cross approximation for Tucker tensors, which we call Cross$^2$-DEIM. Cross$^2$-DEIM is an iterative method that uses a fiber sampling strategy, sampling $O(r)$ fibers in each mode, where $r$ denotes the target rank. The fibers are selected based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Cross$^2$-DEIM resemblances the Fiber Sampling Tucker Decomposition (FSTD)2 approximation, and has favorable computational scaling compared to existing methods in the literature. We demonstrate good performance of Cross$^2$-DEIM in terms of iteration count and intermediate memory. First we design a fast direct Poisson solver based on Cross$^2$-DEIM and the fast Fourier transform. This solver can be used as a stand alone or as a preconditioner for low-rank solvers for elliptic problems.
The second method is a low-rank solver for nonlinear tensor equation in Tucker format by Anderson acceleration (AA), which we call Tucker-AA. Tucker-AA is an extension of low-rank AA (lrAA) proposed in our prior work for low-rank solution to nonlinear matrix equation. We apply Cross$^2$-DEIM with warm-start in Tucker-AA to deal with the nonlinearity in the equation. We apply low-rank operations in AA, and by an appropriate rank truncation strategy, we are able to control the intermediate rank growth. We demonstrated the performance for Tucker-AA for approximate solutions nonlinear PDEs in 3D.

A $k$-star-forest is a forest with at most $k$ connected components where each component is a star. Let $F_k(n)$ be the minimum integer such that the complete graph on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into $F_k(n)$ $k$-star-forests. Pach, Saghafian and Schnider showed that $F_2(n)=\lceil 3n/4 \rceil$. In this paper, we show that $F_3(n)=5n/9$ when $n$ is a multiple of 27. Further, for $k\ge 4$, we show that $F_k(n)=n/2+2$ when $n>2k$ and $n\equiv 4 \pmod{12}$. Our results disprove a conjecture of Pach, Saghafian and Schnider.

Hybrid Neural/Traditional OFDM Receiver with Learnable Decider
Mohanad Obeed, Ming Jian
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as promising solutions for enhancing receiver performance in wireless orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, offering significant improvements over traditional estimation and detection techniques. However, DL-based receivers often face challenges such as poor generalization to unseen channel conditions and difficulty in effectively tracking rapid channel fluctuations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid receiver architecture that integrates the strengths of both traditional and neural receivers. The core innovation is a discriminator neural network trained to dynamically select the optimal receiver whether it is the traditional or DL-based receiver according on the received OFDM block characteristics. This discriminator is trained using labeled pilot signals that encode the comparative performance of both receivers. By including anomalous channel scenarios in training, the proposed hybrid receiver achieves robust performance, effectively overcoming the generalization issues inherent in standalone DL approaches.

Fractional Morrey-Sobolev type embeddings and nonlocal subelliptic problems with oscillating nonlinearities on stratified Lie groups

In this paper, we establish the fractional Morrey-Sobolev type embeddings on stratified Lie groups. This extends and complements the Sobolev type embeddings derived in \cite{GKR}. As an application of the results, we study the following nonlocal subelliptic problem, \begin{equation} \begin{cases} (-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s u= \lambda \beta(x) g(u) & \text{in} \quad \Omega, \\ u=0\quad & \text{in}\quad \mathbb{G}\backslash \Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $0<s<1<p<\infty$ with $ps\geq Q$, $Q$ is the homogeneous dimension of the stratified Lie group $\mathbb{G}$, $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s$ is the fractional $p$-sub-Laplacian on $\mathbb{G},$ $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{G}$, $ \lambda$ is a positive real parameter, $\beta \in L^\infty(\Omega, \R_{>0})$ and $g \in C(\mathbb{R}, \R) $ oscillates near the origin or at infinity. By using the variational principle of Ricceri, we prove the existence and asymptotic behaviors of infinitely many solutions to the problem under consideration. We emphasize that the results obtained here are also novel for $\mathbb{G}$ being the Heisenberg group and $p=2$.

Spectral extrema of graphs of given even size forbidding H(4,3)
Ruiling Zheng, Gang Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A graph is sad to be $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Let $H(k,3)$ be the graph formed by taking a cycle of length $k$ and a triangle on a common vertex. Li, Lu and Peng [Discrete Math. 346 (2023) 113680] proved that if $G$ is an $H(3,3)$-free graph of size $m \geq 8$, then the spectral radius $\rho(G) \leq \frac{1+\sqrt{4 m-3}}{2}$ with equality if and only if $G \cong S_{\frac{m+3}{2}, 2}$, where $S_{\frac{m+3}{2}, 2}=K_2 \vee \frac{m-1}{2}K_1$. Note that the bound is attainable only when $m$ is odd. Recently, Pirzada and Rehman [Comput. Appl. Math. 44 (2025) 295] proved that if $G$ is an $\{H(3,3),H(4,3)\}$-free graph of even size $m \geq 10$, then $\rho(G) \leq \rho^{\prime}(m)$ with equality if and only if $G \cong S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}^{-}$, where $\rho^{\prime}(m)$ is the largest root of $x^4-m x^2-(m-2) x+\frac{m}{2}-1=0$, and $S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}^{-}$ is the graph obtained from $S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}$ by deleting an edge incident to a vertex of degree two. In this paper, we improve the result of Pirzada and Rehman by showing that if $G$ is an $H(4,3)$-free graph of even size $m \geq 38$ without isolated vertices, then $\rho(G) \leq \rho^{\prime}(m)$ with equality if and only if $G \cong S_{\frac{m+4}{2}, 2}^{-}$.

Arbitrary norm growth in the 3D Navier-Stokes equations

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We construct a family of smooth initial data for the Navier-Stokes equations, bounded in $BMO^{-1}(\mathbb T^3)$, that gives rise to arbitrarily large global solutions. As a consequence, we rule out various hypothetical a priori estimates for strong solutions in terms of a critical norm of the initial data. To our knowledge, this is the first example of unbounded norm growth in the well-posed setting. The solutions exhibit an inverse cascade across an unbounded number of modes, with growth resulting from repeated squaring by the quadratic nonlinearity. This mechanism relies on largeness of the data in $B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$ and is fundamentally distinct from instantaneous norm inflation and ill-posedness phenomena.

The same holds true for the SRB entropy functional over the family of smooth expanding maps on a closed Riemannian manifold. This implication leads to the local existence of the gradient flow of the SRB entropy and an explicit formula for the gradient vector of the entropy functional via the linear response of the SRB measure.

Skew Gradient Embedding for Thermodynamically Consistent Systems
Xuelong Gu, Qi Wang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose a novel Skew Gradient Embedding (SGE) framework for systematically reformulating thermodynamically consistent partial differential equation (PDE) models-capturing both reversible and irreversible processes-as generalized gradient flows. These models include a wide spectrum of models in classical electrodynamics, fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, rheology of complex fluids, solid mechanics, and statistical physics. Exploiting the intrinsic structure of generalized gradient flow models, especially, the skew symmetric component expressed by the exterior 2-form, we develop a unified stabilization strategy for constructing numerical schemes that either preserve the energy dissipation rate or ensure discrete energy stability. This stabilization strategy enables the design of both first- and second-order schemes, highlighting the flexibility and generality of the SGE approach in algorithm development. A key strength of SGE is its flexible treatment of skew-gradient (zero-energy-contribution) terms arising from reversible dynamics either implicitly or explicitly. While treated explicitly, it often leads to a natural decoupling of the governing equations in multiphysics systems, thereby improving computational efficiency without compromising stability or accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the robustness, accuracy, and performance advantages of the proposed schemes.

In this paper, we {\it find} the Finsler structure of the Apollonian weak metric on the open unit disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which turns out to be a Randers type Finsler structure and we call it as Apollonian weak-Finsler structure. In fact the Apollonian weak-Finsler structure is the deformation of the hyperbolic Poincaré metric in the unit disc by a closed $1$-form. As a cosequence, the trajectories of the geodesic of this Apollonian weak-Finsler structure pointwise agrees with the geodesic of hyperbolic Poincaré metric in the open unit disc. Further, we explicitly calculate its $S$-curvature, Riemann curvature, Ricci curvature and flag curvature. It turns out that the $S$-curvature of the Apollonian weak-Finsler structure in the unit disc is bounded below by $\frac{3}{2}$, while its flag curvature $K$ satisfies $\frac{-1}{4}\leq K<2$.

Subjects:

We study a Jack analog $\nabla(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ of the super nabla operator recently introduced by Bergeron, Haglund, Iraci and Romero for Macdonald polynomials. We prove that $\nabla(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ has a differential expression in the power-sum basis given in terms of Chapuy--Dołe\k{}ga and Nazarov--Sklyanin operators.
This result is obtained from a more general formula for the operator $G(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ encoding the structure coefficients of Jack characters, from which $\nabla(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ is obtained by taking the top homogeneous part.
A key step of the proof involves establishing that Chapuy--Dołe\k{}ga operators together with a dehomogenized version of Nazarov--Sklyanin operators have a Heisenberg algebra structure. The proof also uses a characterization of the operator $G(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})$ with a family of differential equations, recently established by the author.

Minimal surface doublings and electrostatics for Schrödinger operators

Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Twenty years ago, N. Kapouleas introduced a singular perturbation construction known as "doubling", which produces sequences of high-genus minimal surfaces converging to a given minimal surface with multiplicity two. Doubling constructions have since been implemented successfully in several settings, with deep work of Kapouleas-McGrath reducing their existence theory to the problem of finding suitable families of ansatz data on the initial minimal surface.
In this paper, we introduce a variational approach to the existence of minimal doublings, relating the Kapouleas-McGrath construction to the study of nondegenerate critical points for a Coulomb-type interaction energy. By analyzing the minimizers of this energy, we prove that, in a generic closed 3-manifold, every two-sided, embedded minimal surface of index one admits a sequence of minimal doublings. As a corollary, we find that a generic 3-manifold contains an infinite sequence of embedded minimal surfaces with bounded area and arbitrarily large genus, whose geometry can be described with some precision.

We investigate the three-dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) equations in the absence of resistivity, a regime that is generally ill-posed in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to the system's quasilinear structure. Motivated by the recent work of one of the authors on the inviscid primitive equations (R.~Hu, Q.~Lin, and R.~Liu, \emph{Journal of Nonlinear Science}, 35:84, 2025), we introduce a random diffusion term and demonstrate that it restores local well-posedness almost surely in appropriate Gevrey classes. Furthermore, under slightly stronger diffusion and small initial data, we establish global well-posedness with high probability. These results extend the scope of stochastic regularization techniques to a broader class of quasilinear magnetic systems relevant to plasma physics.

Title:
Global Existence of Solutions for A Class of Nonlocal Reaction-Diffusion Systems and Their Diffusive Limit
Md Shah Alam, Jeff Morgan
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this work, we study the global existence of solutions for a class of semilinear nonlocal reaction-diffusion systems with $m$ components on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary. The initial data is assumed to be component-wise nonnegative and bounded, and the reaction vector field associated with the system is assumed to be quasi-positive and satisfy a generalized mass control condition. We obtain global existence and uniqueness of component-wise nonnegative solutions. With the additional assumption that the reaction vector field satisfies a linear intermediate sums condition, we employ an $L^p$ energy type functional to establish the uniform boundedness of solutions in $L^p(\Omega)$ for all $2 \le p<\infty$ independent of the nonlocal diffusion operator for our system in $L^p$ space for $2 \le p < \infty$. This allows us to generalize a recent diffusive limit result of Laurencot and Walker \cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal}. We, also analyze a class of $m$ component reaction-diffusion systems in which some of the components diffuse nonlocally and the other components diffuse locally, where the latter components satisfy homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Under various assumptions, we establish global existence and uniqueness of componentwise nonnegative solutions by using duality arguments. Finally, we numerically verify our diffusive limit result. We also numerically solve the reaction-diffusion systems with a mixture of nonlocal and local diffusion and show the visual difference of its solutions with the system in which all components diffuse nonlocally.

A Malmquist-Yosida type theorem for Schwarzian differential equations

Complex Variables (math.CV)
In this paper, we study a Malmquist-Yosida type theorem for Schwarzian differential equations
\begin{equation}\label{1}
S(f,z)^{m} = R(z,f) = \frac{P(z,f)}{Q(z,f)},\tag{+}
\end{equation}
where $m \in \mathbb{N}^{+}$, $P(z,f)$ and $Q(z,f)$ are irreducible polynomials in $f$ with rational coefficients. If \eqref{1} admits a transcendental meromorphic solution $f$, then by a suitable M$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$bius transformation $f \to u$, $u$ satisfies a Riccati differential equation with small meromorphic coefficients, or one of the six types of first-order differential equations (E.2)-(E.7), or $u$ satisfies one of types (E.8)-(E.14). In addition, we improve the result of Ishizaki [6, Theorem~1.1] on Schwarzian differential equations \eqref{1} with small meromorphic coefficients when $m=1$.

Nonlinear Fractal Histopolation Function

Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
A novel method for constructing a nonlinear fractal histopolation function associated with a given histogram is introduced in this paper. In contrast to classical fractal interpolation methods, which produce continuous and interpolatory functions, the proposed approach constructs a bounded, Riemann integrable function that is not necessarily continuous but preserves the area of a given histogram. An iterated function system based on Rakotch contractions- a generalisation of Banach contractions- is utilised, thereby extending the theoretical framework for fractal histopolation. Unlike previous formulations, the proposed construction of nonlinear fractal functions allows vertical scaling factors greater than one. The conditions for the nonlinear fractal function to be a solution for the histopolation problem are derived.

In this paper, we explore geometrizations of triangulated hyperbolic 2-tori $\Sigma_2$ in the hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$. We show that for all $n \geq 10$, there exists a triangulation of $\Sigma_2$ with $n$ vertices and an embedding $S: \Sigma_2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{H}^3$ that restricts to isometries on the triangles. We call these embeddings hyperbolic origami 2-tori. Since the lower bound $n \geq 10$ is combinatorially sharp, this paper settles the question of minimum number of vertices required to obtain a hyperbolic embedding.

Large and moderate deviation for rough slow-fast system with level 3 geometric rough path
Xiaoyu Yang, Yong Xu
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This work is to give the large deviation for a slow-fast system with level 3 random geometric rough path. Different from that driver rough path is of level 2, now the driver path comes from an anisotropic rough path that is lifted from the mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter in $(1/4,1/3)$. Unlike the situation of level 2, it requires showing that the translation of mixed FBM in the direction of Cameron-Martin space can still be lifted to a geometric rough path. Firstly, we give the large deviation for the single-time scale system with level 3 random geometric rough path. We still utilize the variational representation and weak convergence method. However, the existence of third-level rough paths still makes the weak convergence analysis more complicated, where more elaborate controlled rough path calculations are needed. Besides, we also give the moderate deviation within more necessary assumptions. Different from large deviation, some boundedness result of the deviation component is required. Then, we extend the large deviation for the slow-fast system with level 3 random geometric rough path. To this end, we show that the controlled slow component weakly converges to the solution to the skeleton equation by averaging to the invariant measure of the fast equation and exploiting the continuity of the solution mapping. Here, the solution to the skeleton equation still could be well-defined in the Young sense within a variational setting.

We determine the size of such an antichain basis. We provide a concrete antichain basis when there is a countable one. We also provide some related quasi-orders and equivalence relations which are analytic complete as sets.

Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) have recently attracted interest for guaranteeing safety and synthesizing safe controllers for discrete-time dynamical systems. This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.

In these notes, we introduce the concept of self-similar graph, associated with groups acting on graphs. We define the corresponding $C^*$-algebra using different complementary approaches, to understand its basic properties. We also analyze various generalizations that appear in the literature and, in particular, review the relationship of this construction with Zappa-Szép products. Finally, we present very recent results on homology and $K$-theory for these algebras.

In this paper, two new constructions of Sidon spaces are given by tactfully adding new parameters and flexibly varying the number of parameters. Under the parameters $ n= (2r+1)k, r \ge2 $ and $p_0=\max \{i\in \mathbb{N}^+: \lfloor \frac{r}{i}\rfloor>\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor \}$, the first construction produces a cyclic CDC in $\mathcal{G}_q(n, k)$ with minimum distance $2k-2$ and size $\frac{\left((r+\sum\limits_{i=2}^{p_0}(\lfloor \frac{r}{i}\rfloor-\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor))(q^k-1)(q-1)+r\right)(q^k-1)^{r-1}(q^n-1)}{q-1}$. Given parameters $n=2rk,r\ge 2$ and if $r=2$, $p_0=1$, otherwise, $p_0=\max\{ i\in \mathbb{N}^+: \lceil\frac{r}{i}\rceil-1>\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor \}$, a cyclic CDC in $\mathcal{G}_q(n, k)$ with minimum distance $2k-2$ and size $\frac{\left((r-1+\sum\limits_{i=2}^{p_0}(\lceil \frac{r}{i}\rceil-\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor-1))(q^k-1)(q-1)+r-1\right)(q^k-1)^{r-2}\lfloor \frac{q^k-2}{2}\rfloor(q^n-1)}{q-1}$ is produced by the second construction. The sizes of our cyclic CDCs are larger than the best known results. In particular, in the case of $n=4k$, when $k$ goes to infinity, the ratio between the size of our cyclic CDC and the Sphere-packing bound (Johnson bound) is approximately equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, for a prime power $q$ and positive integers $k,s$ with $1\le s< k-1$, a cyclic CDC in $\mathcal{G}_q(N, k)$ of size $e\frac{q^N-1}{q-1}$ and minimum distance $\ge 2k-2s$ is provided by subspace polynomials, where $N,e$ are positive integers. Our construction generalizes previous results and, under certain parameters, provides cyclic CDCs with larger sizes or more admissible values of $ N $ than constructions based on trinomials.

Furthermore, the deficiency relation, Picard's theorem and the five-value theorem are extended to the setting of Hahn difference operators by applying the second fundamental theorem.

Learning When to Restart: Nonstationary Newsvendor from Uncensored to Censored Demand

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We study nonstationary newsvendor problems under nonparametric demand models and general distributional measures of nonstationarity, addressing the practical challenges of unknown degree of nonstationarity and demand censoring. We propose a novel distributional-detection-and-restart framework for learning in nonstationary environments, and instantiate it through two efficient algorithms for the uncensored and censored demand settings. The algorithms are fully adaptive, requiring no prior knowledge of the degree and type of nonstationarity, and offer a flexible yet powerful approach to handling both abrupt and gradual changes in nonstationary environments. We establish a comprehensive optimality theory for our algorithms by deriving matching regret upper and lower bounds under both general and refined structural conditions with nontrivial proof techniques that are of independent interest. Numerical experiments using real-world datasets, including nurse staffing data for emergency departments and COVID-19 test demand data, showcase the algorithms' superior and robust empirical performance. While motivated by the newsvendor problem, the distributional-detection-and-restart framework applies broadly to a wide class of nonstationary stochastic optimization problems. Managerially, our framework provides a practical, easy-to-deploy, and theoretically grounded solution for decision-making under nonstationarity.

Optimality of quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of the sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite rule in Gaussian Sobolev spaces

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Optimality of several quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of the sparse-grid quadrature based on the univariate Gauss--Hermite rule is proved in the Sobolev spaces of mixed dominating smoothness of order $\alpha$, where the optimality is in the sense of worst-case convergence rate. For sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite quadrature, lower and upper bounds are established, with rates coinciding up to a logarithmic factor. The dominant rate is found to be only $N^{-\alpha/2}$ with $N$ function evaluations, although the optimal rate is known to be $N^{-\alpha}(\ln N)^{(d-1)/2}$. The lower bound is obtained by exploiting the structure of the Gauss--Hermite nodes and is independent of the quadrature weights; consequently, no modification of the weights can improve the rate $N^{-\alpha/2}$. In contrast, several quasi-Monte Carlo methods with a change of variables are shown to achieve the optimal rate, some up to, and one including, the logarithmic factor.

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
As is well-known, the solutions to the Patlak-Keller-Segel system in 3D may blow up in finite time regardless of any initial cell mass. In this paper, we investigate the existence of global bounded solutions of the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with a large initial cell mass via Couette flow or logistic source in a finite channel. On the one hand, it is proved that as long as the Couette flow is strong enough and the initial velocity is small, the bounded solutions of the system are global in time without any limitation on the initial mass $M$ if the logistic source term exists. On the other hand, if the logistic source term vanishes, it is proved that as long as the Couette flow is strong enough and the initial velocity is small, the solutions with a finite initial mass $M$, whose lower bound is $ \left(\frac{8\pi}{9}\right)^-$, are global in time.

Semigroup rings and algebraically independent sequences with respect to idempotents in commutative semigroups

Combinatorics (math.CO)
For any finite abelian group $G$ and commutative unitary ring $R$, by $R[G]$ we denote the group algebra over $R$. Let $T=(g_1,\ldots,g_{\ell})$ be a sequence over the group $G$. We say $T$ is algebraically zero-sum free over R if $\prod\limits_{i=1}^r(X^{g_i}-a_i)\neq 0\in R[G]$ for all $a_1,\ldots,a_{\ell}\in R\setminus \{0\}$. Let $d(G,R)={\rm sup}\{|T|: T \mbox{ is an algebraically zero-sum free sequence over } R \mbox{ of terms from }G\}.$ This invariant of the group algebra $R[G]$ plays a powerful role in the research for the zero-sum theory. In this paper, we generalize this invariant to the semigroup algebra $R[S]$ for a commutative periodic semigroup $S$. We give the best possible lower and upper bounds for $d(S,R)$ for a general commutative periodic semigroup $S$. In case that $K$ is a field, and $S$ is a finite commutative semigroup, we give more precise result, including the equality for Clifford semigroups, Archimedean semigroups and elementary semigroups, which covers all types of irreducible components associated with the semilattice decomposition and the subdirect product decomposition of a commutative semigroup. Also, the invariant $d(S,K)$ was applied to the study of some zero-sum invariants in semigroups. One conjecture on the equality for $d(S,K)$ in case $K$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero was proposed which has been also partially affirmed in this paper.

Bound tightening in lifted formulations: (sub)solver-dependent impact on performance in RLT-based algorithms
Julio González-Díaz, Brais González-Rodríguez, Ignacio Gómez-Casares
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper we explore a relevant aspect of the interplay between two core elements of global optimization algorithms for nonconvex nonlinear programming problems, which we believe has been overlooked by past literature. The first one is the reformulation of the original problem, which requires the introduction of auxiliary variables with the goal of defining convex relaxations that can be solved both reliably and efficiently on a node-by-node basis. The second one, bound tightening or, more generally, domain reduction, allows to reduce the search space to be explored by the branch-and-bound algorithm. We are interested in the performance implications of propagating the bounds of the original variables to the auxiliary ones in the lifted space: does this propagation reduce the overall size of the tree? does it improve the efficiency at solving the node relaxations? To better understand the above interplay, we focus on the reformulation-linearization technique for polynomial optimization. In this setting we are able to obtain a theoretical result on the implicit bounds of the auxiliary variables in the RLT relaxations, which sets the stage for the ensuing computational study, whose goal is to assess to what extent the performance of an RLT-based algorithm may be affected by the decision to explicitly propagate the bounds on the original variables to the auxiliary ones.

Approximation by multivariate neural network operators in mixed norm space: theory and application
Priyanka Majethiya, Shivam Bajpeyi
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
On the one hand, the framework of mixed norm spaces has potential applications in different areas of mathematics. On the other hand,
neural network (NN) operators are well established as approximators, attracting significant attention in the fields of approximation theory and signal analysis.
In this article, we aim to integrate both these concepts.
Here, we analyze multivariate Kantorovich-type NN operators as approximators based on sigmoidal activation function within various mixed norm structures, namely mixed norm Lebesgue spaces and mixed norm Orlicz spaces. The Orlicz spaces consist of various significant function spaces, such as classical \textit{Lebesgue spaces, Zygmund spaces and Exponential spaces}. We establish the boundedness and convergence of multivariate Kantorovich-type NN operators in these mixed norm function spaces.
At the end, the approximation abilities are illustrated through graphical representations and error-estimates along with
application in image processing, including image reconstruction, image scaling, image inpainting and image denoising. Finally, we address the beneficial impact of mixed norm structure on aforementioned image processing tasks.

In this paper, we investigate optimal stopping problems in a continuous-time framework where only a discrete set of stopping dates is admissible, corresponding to the Bermudan option, within the so-called exploratory formulation. We introduce an associated control problem for the value function, represented as a non-càdlàg reflected backward stochastic differential equation (RBSDE) with an entropy regulariser that promotes exploration, and we establish existence and uniqueness results for this entropy-regularised RBSDE. We then compare the entropy-regularised RBSDE with the theoretical value of a Bermudan option and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm based on a policy improvement scheme, for which we prove both monotone improvement and convergence. This methodology is further extended to Bermudan game options, where we obtain analogous results. Finally, drawing on the preceding analysis, we present two numerical approximation schemes - a BSDE solver based on a temporal-difference scheme and neural networks and the policy improvement algorithm - to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

A Convex Demixing Approach for Hybrid-Field Channel Estimation of XL-MIMO Systems via Atomic Norm Minimization

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Channel estimation is a critical task in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems for 6G wireless communications. A hybrid-field channel model effectively characterizes the mixed far-field and near-field scattering components in practical XL-MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose a convex demixing approach for hybrid-field channel estimation within the atomic norm minimization (ANM) framework. By promoting sparsity of the far-field and near-field components directly in the continuous parameter domain, a demixing scheme that minimizes a weighted sum of two atomic norms is proposed. We show that the resulting ANM is equivalent to a computationally feasible semi-definite programming (SDP). Numerical experiments on simulated data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches for hybrid-field channel estimation.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Robots must satisfy safety-critical state and input constraints despite disturbances and model mismatch. We introduce a robust model predictive control (RMPC) formulation that is fast, scalable, and compatible with real-time implementation. Our formulation guarantees robust constraint satisfaction, input-to-state stability (ISS) and recursive feasibility. The key idea is to decompose the uncertain nonlinear system into (i) a nominal nonlinear dynamic model, (ii) disturbance-feedback controllers, and (iii) bounds on the model error. These components are optimized jointly using sequential convex programming. The resulting convex subproblems are solved efficiently using a recent disturbance-feedback MPC solver. The approach is validated across multiple dynamics, including a rocket-landing problem with steerable thrust. An open-source implementation is available at this https URL.

Doubly Stochastic Matrices and Modified Laplacian Matrices of Graphs
Enide Andrade, Geir Dahl
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We consider modified Laplacian matrices of graphs, obtained by adding the identity matrix to the Laplacian matrix $L_G$ of a graph $G$. This results in a positive definite matrix $\tilde{L}_G$. The inverse of $\tilde{L}_G$ is a doubly stochastic matrix. The goal of this paper is to investigate this inverse matrix and how it depends on properties of the underlying graph $G$. In particular, we introduce a general monotonicity property for the entries of the inverse, and derive a sharper version for the case of path graphs. Finally, we show that, in the case of a path graph, the entries of the inverse can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci numbers via an $LU$ factorization. We also establish a lower bound for the diagonal entries of this inverse for a tree as a function of the distances between vertices. Furthermore, we present a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the inverse when the graph is a tree. Moreover, for a general graph, we show that the diagonal entries of this inverse is strictly largest in each row and column. Finally, we discuss a connection to partial differential equations, such as the heat equation.

A Two-Dimensional Super-Resolution Method for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Near-Field Localization
Feng Xi, Dehui Yang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization in the radiating near-field requires range-aware spherical-wave models, which inherently couple angles and ranges and thus complicate accurate 3D positioning. Using the Fresnel approximation, we show that the RIS response can be expressed as the element-wise product of a 2D far-field steering vector and a range-dependent quadratic-phase chirp. By modeling these chirp components within a low-dimensional subspace, we reformulate the joint recovery of azimuth, elevation, and range under a 2D super-resolution framework, resulting in a 2D atomic norm minimization (2D-ANM) problem. Solving this via semi-definite programming (SDP) yields gridless azimuth-elevation estimation and high-accuracy range recovery. Simulations demonstrate accurate 3D localization and enhanced robustness of the proposed scheme, compared with subspace and compressive sensing methods.

Combinatorics (math.CO)
Given a graph $G$ a set $S\subset V(G)$ is called monophonic if every vertex in $G$ lies on some induced path between two vertices in $S$. The monophonic number, $m(G)$, of $G$, which is the smallest cardinality of a monophonic set in $G$, has been studied from various perspectives. In this paper, we establish $m(K(n,r))$ for all Kneser graphs $K(n,r)$, where $n\ge 2r$. In addition, when $r\ge 3$, we prove an even stronger property, notably that every pair of non-adjacent vertices in $K(n,r)$ forms a monophonic set. We call the graphs satisfying this property strongly $2$-monophonic graphs. We present several (sufficient and necessary) conditions for a graph to be strongly $2$-monophonic, and prove that the Cartesian product of any two strongly $2$-monophonic graphs is also such. Besides non-complete Hamming graphs, we also prove that every Johnson graph is strongly $2$-monophonic, whereas chordal graphs, with the exception of the graphs $K_n-e$, do not enjoy this property.

The well known bunkbed conjecture about percolation on finite graphs is now resolved; Gladkov, Pak and Zimin, building upon work of Hollom, have constructed a counterexample. We revisit this conjecture and study it in the broader context of the class of random cluster measures. We show that the major partial (positive) results on the bunkbed conjecture can also be proved for all random cluster measures, including the results for complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and the case when $p \uparrow 1$.
The arboreal gas measure for forests is another limit of the random cluster measure for which we conjecture the inequality to be true and provide proofs in special cases. We identify a setting where the conjecture does hold, that of ``almost spanning tree measures''. A further analysis leads to intriguing correlation inequalities that complement Rayleigh's inequalities for spanning tree measures.

Nonlocal degenerate parabolic hyperbolic equations on bounded domains. Part II: Existence

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study well-posedness of degenerate mixed-type parabolic-hyperbolic equations $$ \partial_tu+\textrm{div}\big(f(u)\big)=\mathcal{L}[b(u)] $$ on bounded domains with general Dirichlet boundary/exterior conditions. The nonlocal diffusion operator $\mathcal{L}$ is a symmetric L{é}vy operator (e.g. fractional Laplacians) and $b$ is nondecreasing and allowed to have degenerate regions ($b'=0$). In [N. Alibaud, J. Endal, E. R. Jakobsen, and O. Mæhlen. Nonlocal degenerate parabolic hyperbolic equations on bounded domains. \emph{Ann. Inst. H. Poincare Anal. Non Lineaire}, 2025. Published online first, DOI https://doi.org/10.4171/AIHPC/153], we introduced an entropy solution formulation for the problem and showed uniqueness of bounded entropy solutions under general assumptions. In this paper we complete the program by proving existence of such solutions. Starting from known results for scalar conservations laws, existence is proved first for bounded/zero order operators $\mathcal{L}$ by a fixed point argument, and then extended in steps to more general operators via approximations of $\mathcal{L}$. Lack of strong compactness of approximate solutions $u_n$ is overcome through nonlinear weak-$\star$ compactness and entropy-process solutions. Key ingredients are stability results for our formulation and \textit{strong} compactness of the term $b(u)$, both with respect to variations in $\mathcal{L}$. Strong compactness follows from energy estimates and novel arguments for transferring weak regularity from $\partial_t u_n$ to $\partial_t b(u_n)$. Our work can be seen as both extending nonlocal theories from the whole space to domains and local theories on domains to the nonlocal case. Unlike local theories our formulation does not assume energy estimates. They are now a consequence of the formulation, but as opposed to previous nonlocal theories, they play an essential role in our arguments. Several results of independent interest are established, including a characterization of the L{é}vy operators $\mathcal{L}$ for which the corresponding energy/Sobolev-space compactly embeds into $L^2$.

Local limits of conditioned marked Galton Watson trees

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider a Galton-Watson tree where each node is marked independently of each others with a probability depending on its outdegree. We give a complete picture of the local convergence of critical or sub-critical marked Galton-Watson trees conditioned on having a large number of marks. In the critical and sub-critical generic case, the limit is a random marked tree with an infinite spine, named marked Kesten's tree. We focus also on the non-generic case, where the local limit is a random marked tree with a node with infinite out-degree. This case corresponds to the so-called marked condensation phenomenon.

A New Approach to the Data-Driven Output-Based LQR Problem of Continuous-Time Linear Systems
Liquan Lin, Haoyan Lin, Jie Huang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
A promising method for constructing a data-driven output-feedback control law involves the construction of a model-free observer. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimal control policy can then be obtained by both policy-iteration (PI) and value-iteration (VI) algorithms. However, this method requires some unknown parameterization matrix to be of full row rank and needs to solve a sequence of high dimensional linear equations for either PI or VI algorithm. In this paper, we first show that this matrix is of full row rank under the standard controllability assumption of the plant, thus removing the main hurdle for applying this method. Then we further modify the existing method by defining an ancillary system whose LQR solution will lead to a data-driven output-feedback control law. By this new method, the rank condition of the unknown parameterization matrix is not needed any more. Moreover, we derive a new sequence of linear equations for either PI or VI algorithm whose number of unknown variables is significantly less than that of the existing PI or VI algorithm, thus not only improving the computational efficiency but also relaxing the solvability conditions of the existing PI or VI algorithm. Further, since the existing PI or VI algorithm only applies to the case where some Riccati equation admits a unique positive definite solution, we prove that both the PI algorithm and the VI algorithm in the literature can be generalized to the case where the Riccati equation only admits a unique positive semi-definite solution.

Entropy Regularization in Mean-Field Games of Optimal Stopping

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study mean-field games of optimal stopping (OS-MFGs) and introduce an entropy-regularized framework to enable learning-based solution methods. By utilizing randomized stopping times, we reformulate the OS-MFG as a mean-field game of singular stochastic controls (SC-MFG) with entropy regularization. We establish the existence of equilibria and prove their stability as the entropy parameter vanishes. Fictitious play algorithms tailored for the regularized setting are introduced, and we show their convergence under both Lasry-Lions monotonicity and supermodular assumptions on the reward functional. Our work lays the theoretical foundation for model-free learning approaches to OS-MFGs.

On the Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Evaluation
Jiacai Liu, Wenye Li, Ke Wei
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.

On the Boundary of the Robust Admissible Set in State and Input Constrained Nonlinear Systems

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In this paper, we consider nonlinear control systems subject to bounded disturbances and to both state and input constraints. We introduce the definition of robust admissible set - the set of all initial states from which the state and input constraints can be satisfied for all times against all admissible disturbances. We focus on its boundary that can be decomposed into the usable part on the state constraint boundary and the barrier, interior to the state constraints. We show that, at the intersection of these two components, the boundary of the admissible set must be tangent to the state constraints and separate the interior of the robust admissible set and its complement. Moreover, we prove that the barrier must satisfy a saddle-point principle on a Hamiltonian, in the spirit of Pontryagin's maximum principle, thus providing a direct computational tool. Lastly, we illustrate our results by calculating the robust admissible set for an adaptive cruise control example.

From finding a spanning subgraph $H$ to an $H$-factor
Allan Lo
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A typical Dirac-type problem in extremal graph theory is to determine the minimum degree threshold for a graph $G$ to have a spanning subgraph $H$, e.g. the Dirac theorem. A natural following up problem would be to seek an $H$-factor, which a spanning set of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$. In this short note, we present a method of obtaining an upper bound on the minimum degree threshold for an $H$-factor from one for finding a spanning copy of $H$.
As an application, we proved that, for all $\varepsilon>0$ and $\ell$ sufficiently large, any oriented graph $G$ on $\ell m$ vertices with minimum semi-degree $\delta^0(G) \ge (3/8+ \varepsilon) k \ell$ contains a $C_\ell$-factor, where $C_\ell$ is an arbitrary orientation of a cycle on $\ell$ vertices. This improves a result of Wang, Yan and Zhang.

We study the following gradient elliptic system with Neumann boundary conditions \begin{equation*} -\Delta u + \lambda_1 u = u^3 + \beta uv^2, \ -\Delta v + \lambda_2 v = v^3 + \beta u^2 v \ \text{in } \Omega,\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu} = 0 \ \text{on } \partial \Omega, \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N $ is a bounded $ C^2$ domain with $ N \leq 4 $, and $ \nu $ denotes the outward unit normal on the boundary. We investigate the existence of non-constant least energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta > 0 $) and the competitive ($ \beta < 0 $) regimes, considering both the definite and the indefinite case, namely $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\in\mathbb R$. We emphasize that our analysis includes both the subcritical case $ N \leq 3 $ and the critical case $ N = 4 $.
Depending on the values of $\beta,\lambda_1,\lambda_2$, the least energy solution is obtained either via a linking theorem, by minimizing over a suitable Nehari manifold, or by direct minimization on the set of all non-trivial weak solutions. Our results and techniques can be also adapted to cover some previously untreated cases for Dirichlet conditions.

Development Processes
Paul Gorbow
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
Throughout mathematics there are constructions where an object is obtained as a limit of an infinite sequence. Typically, the objects in the sequence improve as the sequence progresses, and the ideal is reached at the limit. I introduce a view that understands this as a development process by which a dynamic mathematical object develops teleologically. In particular, this paper elaborates and clarifies the intuition that such constructions operate on a single dynamic object that maintains its identity throughout the process, and that each step consists in a transformation of this dynamic object, rather than in a genesis of an entirely new static object. This view is supported by a general philosophical discussion, and by a formal modal first-order framework of development processes. In order to exhibit the ubiquity of such processes in mathematics, and showcase the advantages of this view, the framework is applied to wide range of examples: The set of real numbers, forcing extensions of models of set theory, non-standard numbers of arithmetic, the reflection theorem schema of set theory, and the revision semantics of truth. Thus, the view proposed promises to yield a unified dynamic ontology for infinitary mathematics.

It is standard to construct the Infinite Incipient Cluster as the limit of the critical percolation measure conditioned on 0 being connected to radius n, as n tends to infinity. We provide a short proof of that convergence in the planar setting. A key step in the proof is to introduce an unbiased percolation configuration above which are coupled two percolations conditioned on 0 being connected to different radii. It implies a speed of convergence in total variation distance to the IIC measure upper-bounded by the dual one-arm probability, which is the first occurrence of an explicit upperbound.

Perfect Divisibility and Coloring of Some Bull-Free Graphs
Ran Chen, Di Wu, Junran Yu, Xiaowen Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])<\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edge, a {\em fork } is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing an edge once, and an {\em odd torch} is a graph obtained from an odd hole by adding an edge $xy$ such that $x$ is nonadjacent to any vertex on the odd hole and the set of neighbors of $y$ on the odd hole is a stable set.
Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019) 54-60] proved that every (odd hole, bull)-free graph and every ($P_5$, bull)-free graph are perfectly divisible. Karthick {\em et al.} [The Electron. J. of Combin. 29 (2022) P3.19.] proved that every (fork, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Chen and Xu [Discrete Appl. Math. 372 (2025) 298-307.] proved that every ($P_7,C_5$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Let $H\in$\{\{odd~balloon\}, $\{P_8,C_5\}\}$. In this paper, we prove that every ($H$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. We also prove that a ($P_6$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Mycielski-Grötzsch graph as an induced subgraph. As corollaries, these graphs is $\binom{\omega+1}{2}$-colorable. Notice that every odd torch contains an odd hole, a $P_5$, and a fork. Therefore, our results generalize the results of these scholars. Moreover, we prove that every ($P_6$, bull)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\omega(G)^7$.

Pair state transfer in tensor product and double cover
Ming Jiang, Xiaogang Liu, Jing Wang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Quantum state transfer, first introduced by Bose in 2003, is an important physical phenomenon in quantum networks, which plays a vital role in quantum communication and quantum computing. In 2004, Christandl et al. proposed the concept of perfect state transfer on graphs by modeling the quantum network using graphs, and unveiled the feasibility of applying graph theory to quantum state transfer. In 2018, Chen and Godsil proposed the definition of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer on graphs, which is a brilliant generalization of perfect state transfer. In this paper, we investigate the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer in tensor product and double cover of two regular graphs, respectively, and reveal fundamental connections between perfect state transfer and Laplacian perfect pair state transfer. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the tensor product of two regular graphs to admit Laplacian perfect pair state transfer, where one of the two regular graphs admits perfect state transfer or Laplacian perfect pair state transfer. Additionally, we characterize the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state transfer in the double cover of two regular graphs. By our results, a variety of families of graphs admitting Laplacian perfect pair state transfer can be constructed.

The result extends previously known cases, recovering the formulas for the sphere and the special orthogonal group as particular instances.

From Fixed to Fluid: Unlocking the New Potential with Fluid RIS (FRIS)

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Owing to its flexible and intelligent electromagnetic signal manipulation, the technology of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has attracted widespread attention. However, the potential of current RISs can only be partly unlocked due to their fixed geometry and element patterns. Motivated by the concept of the fluid antenna system (FAS), a novel RIS system, termed fluid RIS (FRIS), has been developed. Unlike traditional RISs, FRIS allows the element positions or radiation patterns to exhibit ``fluid" properties, i.e., dynamic reconfigurability, to adapt to the wireless environment, offering enhanced beamforming flexibility and environmental adaptability. Given that research on FRIS is still in its infancy, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of its current developments and future prospects. Specifically, the key features of FRIS are first presented, including its classification, fundamental mechanisms, and advantages. Next, potential application scenarios of FRIS are analyzed and discussed, followed by two illustrative case studies demonstrating its potential. Finally, the main open challenges and future research directions related to FRIS are highlighted.

Novel Adaptive Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce new adaptive schemes for the one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Our schemes are based on an adaption strategy recently introduced in [{\sc S. Chu, A. Kurganov, and I. Menshov}, Appl. Numer. Math., 209 (2025)]. As there, we use a smoothness indicator (SI) to automatically detect ``rough'' parts of the solution and employ in those areas the second-order finite-volume low-dissipation central-upwind scheme with an overcompressive limiter, which helps to sharply resolve nonlinear shock waves and linearly degenerate contact discontinuities. In smooth parts, we replace the limited second-order scheme with a quasi-linear fifth-order (in space and third-order in time) finite-difference scheme, recently proposed in [{\sc V. A. Kolotilov, V. V. Ostapenko, and N. A. Khandeeva}, Comput. Math. Math. Phys., 65 (2025)]. However, direct application of this scheme may generate spurious oscillations near ``rough'' parts, while excessive use of the overcompressive limiter may cause staircase-like nonphysical structures in smooth areas. To address these issues, we employ the same SI to distinguish contact discontinuities, treated with the overcompressive limiter, from other ``rough'' regions, where we switch to the dissipative Minmod2 limiter. Advantage of the resulting adaptive schemes are clearly demonstrated on a number of challenging numerical examples.

Solving Sparse MIQCQPs: Application to the Unit Commitment Problem with ACOPF Constraints

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs arise in a variety of applications, particularly in energy, water, and gas systems, where discrete decisions interact with nonconvex quadratic constraints. These problems are computationally challenging due to the combination of combinatorial complexity and nonconvexity, often rendering traditional exact methods ineffective for large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a solution framework for sparse MIQCQPs that integrates semidefinite programming relaxations with chordal decomposition techniques to exploit both term and correlative sparsity. By leveraging problem structure, we significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite constraints into smaller, tractable blocks, improving the scalability of the relaxation and the overall branch-and-bound procedure. We evaluate our framework on the Unit Commitment problem with AC Optimal Power Flow constraints to show that our method produces strong bounds and high-quality solutions on standard IEEE test cases up to 118 buses, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in solving MIQCQPs.

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $R$ be an associative (not necessarily commutative or unital) ring. A cover by left ideals of $R$ is a collection of proper left ideals whose set-theoretic union equals $R$. If such a cover exists, we define the left ideal covering number $\eta_\ell(R)$ to be the cardinality of a minimal cover, and we also define $R$ to be $\eta_\ell$-elementary if $\eta_\ell(R) < \eta_\ell(R/I)$ for every nonzero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$. Similarly, we can define analogous notions for covers by right ideals $\eta_r(R)$ and two-sided ideals $\eta(R)$. In this paper, we classify all $\eta_\ell$-, $\eta_r$-, and $\eta$-elementary rings, and determine their corresponding ideal covering numbers. Since any ring $R$ that admits a finite cover by left ideals has an $\eta_\ell$-elementary residue ring $R/I$ such that $\eta_\ell(R) = \eta_\ell(R/I)$, this completely characterizes such rings and their ideal covering numbers, and likewise for rings coverable by right or two-sided ideals.

We consider the $n$-dimensional random temporal hypercube, i.e., the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph with its edges endowed with i.i.d. continuous random weights. We say that a vertex $w$ is accessible from another vertex $v$ if and only if there is a path from $v$ to $w$ with increasing edge weights. We study accessible "direct" paths from a fixed vertex to its antipodal point and show that as $n \to \infty$, the number of such paths converges in distribution to a mixed Poisson law with mixture given by the product of two independent exponentials with rate $1$. Our proof makes use of the Chen-Stein method, coupling arguments, as well as combinatorial arguments which show that typical pairs of accessible paths have small overlap.

1-bit RIS-aided Index Modulation with Quantum Annealing

Journal-ref:
IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, 2025
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper, we investigate a new index modulation (IM) scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications with 1-bit RIS phase resolution. In addition to the traditional modulated symbols, extra bits of information are embedded in the binary RIS phase vector by indexing the cardinality of the positive phases shifts. To maximize capacity, the IM-based RIS vector is selected so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. The proposed IM design requires the solution of a quadratic binary optimization problem with an equality constraint at the transmitter as well as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem at the receiver. Since commercial solvers cannot directly handle constraints, a penalty method that embeds the equality constraint in the objective function is investigated. To overcome the empirical tuning of the penalty parameter, an iterative Augmented Lagrangian optimization technique is also investigated where a QUBO problem is solved at each iteration. The proposed design and associated mathematical framework are tested in a real-world quantum annealing device provided by D-WAVE. Rigorous experimental results demonstrate that the D-WAVE heuristic efficiently solves the considered combinatorial problems. Furthermore, theoretical bounds on the average capacity are provided. Both experimental and theoretical results show that the proposed design outperforms conventional counterparts.

We prove that if $H$ is a matching, then any total-$(\Delta+3)$-coloring of $H$ in $G$ extends to $G$ provided $\Delta\geq 28$; this number of colors is best-possible without introducing a distance condition on $H$. We also prove that if $H$ is a set of distance-3 cliques then any total-$(\Delta+1)$-coloring of $H$ extends to $G$ provided $\Delta\geq 27$; this distance condition cannot be lowered.

Roughly speaking, lamplighter graphs encode the possible configurations of a lamplighter that moves along a given graph and that modifies the colours of lamps at vertices. This article is dedicated to the following delicate question: when do two lamplighter graphs have the same coarse geometry, i.e.\ when are they quasi-isometric? Inspired by elementary ideas from topology, which we will ``coarsify'', I will survey some techniques that allow us to compare efficiently lamplighter graphs (and more) up to quasi-isometry.

Moreover, we compute the PI-degree of the quantum tori, which are the same with those of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras.

When a game involves many agents or when communication between agents is not possible, it is useful to resort to distributed learning where each agent acts in complete autonomy without any information on the other agents' situations. Perturbation-based algorithms have already been used for such tasks. We propose some improvements based on practical observations to improve the performance of these algorithms. We show that the introduction of these changes preserves their theoretical convergence properties towards states that maximize the average reward and improve them in the case where optimal states exist. Moreover, we show that these algorithms can be made robust to the addition of randomness to the rewards, achieving similar convergence guarantees. Finally, we discuss the possibility for the perturbation factor of the algorithm to decrease during the learning process, akin to simulated annealing processes.

Note on the positivity of the real part of the log-derivative of the Riemann $ξ$-function near the critical line
Andrius Grigutis, Lukas Turčinskas
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In this work, we investigate the positivity of the real part of the log-derivative of the Riemann $\xi$-function in the region $1/2+1/\sqrt{\log t}<\sigma<1$, where $t$ is sufficiently large. We provide an explicit lower bound for $\mathfrak{R}\sum_{\rho}1/(s-\rho)$, where the summation runs over the zeta-zeros on the critical line. We also consider hypothetical cases of positivity of the log-derivative of the Riemann $\xi$-function in the provided region, assuming that there are non-trivial zeta-zeros off the critical line.

We interpret the ranks of the rational homotopy groups of a K3 surface as dimensions of representations for the largest sporadic simple Mathieu group. We then construct a vertex algebra equipped with an action by the largest Mathieu group, and use it to associate Jacobi forms to this interpretation, in a compatible way. Our results suggest a topological role for the sporadic simple Mathieu groups in the theory of K3 surfaces.

Lagrangian Spheres and Cyclic Quotient T-singularities

Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
We study the Lagrangian isotopy classification of Lagrangian spheres in the Milnor fibre, $B_{d,p,q}$, of the cyclic quotient surface T-singularity $\frac{1}{dp^2} (1,dpq-1)$. We prove that there is a finitely generated group of symplectomorphisms such that the orbit of a fixed Lagrangian sphere exhausts the set of Lagrangian isotopy classes. Previous classifications of Lagrangian spheres have been established in simpler symplectic $4$-manifolds, being either monotone, or simply connected, whilst the family studied here satisfies neither of these properties. We construct Lefschetz fibrations for which the Lagrangian spheres are isotopic to matching cycles, which reduces the problem to a computation involving the mapping class group of a surface. These fibrations are constructed using the techniques of $J$-holomorphic curves and Symplectic Field Theory, culminating in the construction of a $J$-holomorphic foliation by cylinders of $T^*S^2$. Our calculations provide evidence towards the symplectic mapping class group of $B_{d,p,q}$ being generated by Lagrangian sphere Dehn twists and another type of symplectomorphism arising as the monodromy of the $\frac{1}{p^2}(1,pq-1)$ singularity.

Tight eigenvalue bound on the traveling salesman problem

Comments:
21 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
A lower bound on the solution to the traveling salesman problem is provided, which is expressed in terms of eigenvalues related to the distance matrix for the problem. This bound has many interesting properties such as transforming appropriately under affine distance transformations and is notably tight for various families of traveling salesman problems with arbitrarily many cities. It is also computed for some real world traveling salesman problems. The eigenvalues in the bound are further related to the Schoenberg criterion from Euclidean geometry. Graph theoretic applications to the Hamiltonian cycle and path problems are given by the fact that the new bound entails necessary graph eigenvalue conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian or traceable. Various non-trivial families of Cayley graphs saturate these Hamiltonicity conditions, thus in a sense providing almost counterexamples to the famous conjecture that all Cayley graphs are Hamiltonian.

The directional correction theorem is rigorously illustrated with a Gaussian example.

Subjects:

We study a statistic $\mathsf{traj}$ on the ordered pairs $(P,Q)$ of Dyck paths of size $n$, which counts the number of billiard trajectories in the grid polygon enclosed by $P$ and $-Q$, where $-Q$ is the path obtained by reflecting $Q$ over the ground line. It turns out to coincide with the component statistic of meanders. In terms of grid polygon, we establish an involution on the set of such ordered pairs $(P,Q)$ which either increases or decreases $\mathsf{traj}(P,Q)$ by 1. This proves a result by Di Francesco--Golinelli--Guitter that the numbers of semimeanders (meanders, respectively) of order $n$ with even and odd numbers of components are equal if $n$ is even and differ by a Catalan number (the square of a Catalan number, respectively) if $n$ is odd. Some results about $(-1)$-evaluation of the generating functions for the statistic $\mathsf{traj}$ on restricted sets of Dyck paths are also presented.

We establish a new connection between the iHowe duality of type AIII established by Luo-Xu and the iSchur duality established by Bao-Wang. We show that iweight $\overline{\rho}$ space in the iHowe duality is naturally isomorphic to the tensor space in the iSchur duality. Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overline{\rho}$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra. Meanwhile, in the iHowe duality, we identify the relative braid group action from one side with the action of $K$-matrices and $R$-matrices from the other side.

Markov combination is an operation that takes two statistical models and produces a third whose marginal distributions include those of the original models. Building upon and extending existing work in the Gaussian case, we develop Markov combinations for categorical variables and their statistical models. We present several variants of this operation, both algorithmically and from a sampling perspective, and discuss relevant examples and theoretical properties. We describe Markov combinations for special models such as regular exponential families, discrete copulas, and staged trees. Finally, we offer results about model invariance and the maximum likelihood estimation of Markov combinations.

$R$-matrix Dunkl operators and spin Calogero-Moser system
Oleg Chalykh, Maria Matushko
Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We construct a quantum integrable model which is an $R$-matrix generalization of the Calogero-Moser system, based on the Baxter-Belavin elliptic $R$-matrix. This is achieved by introducing $R$-matrix Dunkl operators so that commuting quantum spin Hamiltonians can be obtained from symmetric combinations of those. We construct quantum and classical $R$-matrix Lax pairs for these systems. In particular, we recover in a conceptual way the classical $R$-matrix Lax pair of Levin, Olshanetsky, and Zotov, as well as the quantum Lax pair found by Grekov and Zotov. Finally, using the freezing procedure, we construct commuting conserved charges for the associated quantum spin chain proposed by Sechin and Zotov, and introduce its integrable deformation. Our results remain valid when the Baxter-Belavin $R$-matrix is replaced by any of the trigonometric $R$-matrices found by Schedler and Polishchuk in their study of the associative Yang-Baxter equation.

A Solovay-like model at $\aleph_ω$

Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
Assuming the consistency of ZFC with appropriate large cardinal axioms we produce a model of ZFC where $\aleph_\omega$ is a strong limit cardinal and the inner model $L(\mathcal{P}(\aleph_\omega))$ satisfies the following properties: (1) Every set $A\subseteq (\aleph_\omega)^\omega$ has the $\aleph_\omega$-PSP. (2) There is no scale at $\aleph_\omega$. (3) The Singular Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) fails at $\aleph_\omega$. (4) Shelah's Approachability property (AP) fails at $\aleph_\omega$. (5) The Tree Property (TP) holds at $\aleph_{\omega+1}$. The above provides the first example of a Solovay-type model at the level of the first singular cardinal, $\aleph_\omega$. Our model also answers, in the context of ZF+$\mathrm{DC}_{\aleph_\omega}$, a well-known question by Woodin on the relationship between the SCH, the AP and the TP at $\aleph_\omega$.

Computational models provide crucial insights into complex biological processes such as cancer evolution, but their mechanistic nature often makes them nonlinear and parameter-rich, complicating calibration. We systematically evaluate parameter probability distributions in cell migration models using Bayesian calibration across four complementary strategies: parametric and surrogate models, each with and without explicit model discrepancy. This approach enables joint analysis of parameter uncertainty, predictive performance, and interpretability. Applied to a real data experiment of glioblastoma progression in microfluidic devices, surrogate models achieve higher computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, whereas parametric models yield more reliable parameter estimates due to their mechanistic grounding. Incorporating model discrepancy exposes structural limitations, clarifying where model refinement is necessary. Together, these comparisons offer practical guidance for calibrating and improving computational models of complex biological systems.

Subjects:

We study the unique recovery of time-independent lower order terms appearing in the symmetric first order perturbation of the Riemannian wave equation by sending and measuring waves in disjoint open sets of \textit{a priori} known closed Riemannian manifold. In particular, we show that if the set where we capture the waves satisfies a geometric control condition as well as a certain local symmetry condition for the distance functions, then the aforementioned measurement is sufficient to recover the lower order terms up to the natural gauge. For instance, our result holds if the complement of the receiver set is contained in a simple Riemannian manifold.

We consider a dissipative quantum fluid on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 1$) confined by an external harmonic potential. The dynamics of the quantum fluid is described by the Quantum Navier-Stokes (QNS) system which is a particular case of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg systems. The goal of this paper is to prove the existence of global weak solutions to the QNS system. To this end, we write the evolution equations with respect to a Gaussian reference measure and follow the general strategy of previous works. Nevertheless, several substantial modifications have to be done due to our choice of the reference measure.

Moreover, we obtain the optimal decay rates for the $H^1$-norm of the solution. The proofs of our main results rely on the special structure of the equations and anisotropic Sobolev-type inequalities.

Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Pipeline-parallel distributed optimization is essential for large-scale machine learning but is challenged by significant communication overhead from transmitting high-dimensional activations and gradients between workers. Existing approaches often depend on impractical unbiased gradient assumptions or incur sample-size memory overhead. This paper introduces Clapping, a Communication compression algorithm with LAzy samPling for Pipeline-parallel learnING. Clapping adopts a lazy sampling strategy that reuses data samples across steps, breaking sample-wise memory barrier and supporting convergence in few-epoch or online training regimes. Clapping comprises two variants including Clapping-FC and Clapping-FU, both of which achieve convergence without unbiased gradient assumption, effectively addressing compression error propagation in multi-worker settings. Numerical experiments validate the performance of Clapping across different learning tasks.

The aim of this paper is to extend the coisotropic embedding theorem obtained by M. J. Gotay for pre-symplectic manifolds to more general geometric settings: cosymplectic, contact, cocontact, $k$-symplectic, $k$-cosymplectic, $k$-contact, and multisymplectic manifolds. The results are obtained by applying a generic methodology, which gives more relevance to the potential applications. In that sense, this paper gives the fundamental basis to be able to apply the results to the so-called regularization problem of singular Lagrangian systems, both in mechanics and in classical field theories.

Well posedness for multidimensional scalar conservation laws with discontinuous non-degenerate flux
Darko Mitrovic
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for scalar conservation laws with discontinuous, non-degenerate fluxes. Locally, the fluxes are piecewise smooth across interfaces described by a Heaviside-type discontinuity, with left and right states depending smoothly on both space and the solution variable. The interface is given by a smooth function, and the fluxes vanish at the boundary values of the admissible interval for the solution.
In addition, we consider the more general case of heterogeneous flux functions with bounded variation in the spatial variable and smooth dependence on the solution variable, again vanishing at the prescribed boundary states. For this setting, we construct a stable semigroup of solutions, thereby establishing a well-posed solution framework.

In this paper, we introduce a new example of such a simplicial $n$-complex through a simple argument in piecewise linear topology and an application of the van Kampen--Flores theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of additional such complexes through higher dimensional generalizations of the $\triangle Y$-exchange on graphs.

A Divergence-free Preserving Mixed Finite Element Method for Thermally Driven Active Fluid Model
Nan Zheng, Qingguang Guan, Wenlong Pei, Wenju Zhao
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this report, we propose a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element method (FEM) for the system of nonlinear fourth-order thermally driven active fluid equations. By introducing two auxiliary variables, we lower the complexity of the model and enhance the robustness of the algorithm. The auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$ is used to convert the original fourth-order system to an equivalent system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-conforming finite element space. The second variable $\eta$, analogous to the pressure, helps the scheme preserve the divergence-free condition arising from the model. The two-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator, unconditionally non-linear stable and second-order accurate under non-uniform time grids, is combined with the mixed FEM for fully discrete approximation. Due to the fine properties of the DLN scheme, we prove the boundedness of model energy and the associated error estimates under suitable regularity assumptions and mild time restrictions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a minimum-dissipation criterion is to balance computational costs and time efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.

Hybrid Adaptive Robust Stochastic Optimization Model for the Design of a Photovoltaic Battery Energy Storage System

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Future energy projections and their inherent uncertainty play a key role in the design of photovoltaic-battery energy storage systems (PV-BESS) for household use. In this study, both stochastic and robust optimization techniques are simultaneously integrated into a Hybrid Adaptive Robust-Stochastic Optimization (HARSO) model. Uncertainty in future PV generation is addressed using a stochastic approach, while uncertainty in power demand is handled through robust optimization. To solve the tri-level structure emerging from the hybrid approach, a Column-and-Constraint Generation (CCG) algorithm is implemented. The model also accounts for battery degradation by considering multiple commercially available battery chemistries, enabling a more realistic evaluation of long-term system costs and performance. To demonstrate its applicability, the model is applied to a case study involving the optimal design of a PV-BESS system for a household in Spain. The empirical analysis includes both first-life (FL) and second-life (SL) batteries with different chemistries, providing a comprehensive evaluation of design alternatives under uncertainty. Results indicate that the optimal solution is highly dependent on the level of robustness considered, leading to a shift in design strategy. Under less conservative settings, robustness is achieved by increasing battery capacity, while higher levels of conservatism favor expanding PV capacity to meet demand.

We show that the semigroup associated to a second-order elliptic system is positive if and only if the differential equations are essentially decoupled and the coefficients are real-valued. This means the system can be replaced by an equivalent decoupled system (which defines the same semigroup). Instead of matrix coefficients we more generally consider operator-valued coefficients, which leads to interesting additional difficulties with respect to Banach space valued integration.

Optimum Spectrum Extension for PAPR Reduction of DFT-s-OFDM
Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval, Fredrik Berggren, Branislav M. Popovic
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Uplink coverage in cellular networks is constrained by the maximum UE transmit power, making peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction essential. While DFT-s-OFDM with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS) achieves significantly lower PAPR than OFDM, especially with pi/2-BPSK, the PAPR remains too high for higher-rate transmission. Spectrum extension (SE) combined with FDSS (FDSS-SE) can further reduce the PAPR for higher-order QAM. This paper considers FDSS-SE with parametrized FDSS windows spanning a range of possible power ripples, as well as arbitrary circular shifts of the subcarrier coefficients. We optimize both the frequency shift and the SE size, and show that there exists an optimal SE size for reducing the PAPR and another one for increasing the rate. Analysis and simulations reveal that both optima largely depend on the window attenuation but are nearly invariant in proportion to the bandwidth. While the PAPR-optimal SE size is nearly invariant to the constellation order of regular QAM, the rate-optimal SE size depends also on the SNR. These insights provide practical guidelines for beyond-5G uplink coverage enhancement, highlighting that SE size should be individually configured according to the user's FDSS window and link quality.

Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Numerical approximation of quantum states via convex combinations of states with positive partial transposes (bi-PPT state) in multipartite systems constitutes a fundamental challenge in quantum information science. We reformulate this problem as a linearly constrained optimization problem. An approximate model is constructed through an auxiliary variable and a suitable penalty parameter, balancing constraint violation and approximation error. To slove the approximate model, we design a Linearized Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (LPADMM), proving its convergence under a prescribed inequality condition on regularization parameters. The algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for attaining $\epsilon$-stationary solutions. Numerical validation on diverse quantum systems, including three-qubit W/GHZ states and five-partite GHZ and multiGHZ states with noises, confirms high-quality bi-PPT approximations and decomposability certification, demonstrating the utility of our method for quantum information applications.

On the failure of weak convergence for Rademacher random multiplicative functions
Yeor Hafouta
Comments:
12 pp

Probability (math.PR); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Number Theory (math.NT)
Let $\cP$ be the set of prime numbers, and $X_p,\, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables such that $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $(\te_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ the corresponding random multiplicative functions of Radamacher type, namely, $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. The motivation behind considering these variables comes from the Riemann Hypothesis since $(\te_\ell)$ can be viewed as the random counterpart of the Möbius function $\mu(\ell)$ and the RH is equivalent to $\sum_{\ell\leq n}\mu(\ell)=o(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}), \forall \varepsilon>0$. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{\sqrt n}\to 0$ in distribution. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(\sqrt n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. In this paper we, in particular, show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on trigonometric identities, Levi's continuity theorem, the prime numbers theorem and the growth rates of the prime omega function $\om(n)$. Combining these tools we show that if a weak limit exists then the characteristic function of $S_n/a_n$ must converge to $0$ at any nonzero point. As a byproduct of our method we are also able to provide essentially optimal upper bounds on high order moments similar to \cite{Har19}, using different methods and for more general $X_p$'s.

We determine when an exotic sphere $\Sigma$ of dimension $d\not{\equiv }1\pmod{4}$ can be detected through the homotopy type of its truncated Disc-presheaf. The latter records the diagram of framed configuration spaces of bounded cardinality in $\Sigma$ with natural point-forgetting and -splitting maps between them. Our proof involves three ingredients that could be of independent interest: a gluing result for Disc-presheaves of manifolds divided into two codimension zero submanifolds, a version of Atiyah duality in the context of Disc-presheaves, and a computation of the finite residual of the mapping class group of the connected sums $\sharp^g(S^{2k+1}\times S^{2k+1})$.

A Bound on the Symplectic Systolic Ratio of Polytopes in Even-Dimensional Euclidean Space
Matthew Zediker
Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
Symplectic capacities are invariants in symplectic geometry that are used to obstruct symplectic embeddings. From a certain symplectic capacity, the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, one can construct the systolic ratio, which measures the difference in the capacity and the Euclidean volume. The systolic ratio of a unit ball is always 1. It was conjectured by Viterbo that the systolic ratio is bounded by 1. This conjecture was disproven by Haim-Kislev recently, and now it is open to determine what bounds one may obtain on the systolic ratio if not 1. In this paper, the author investigates bounds on the systolic ratio of polytopes. In particular, a sharp bound on the systolic ratio of simplices in any dimension is obtained, with the dependence on dimension made explicit.

Regularity estimate and sparse approximation of pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai equation

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we establish an \textit{a priori} estimate for arbitrary-order derivatives of the solution to the pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation within the framework of weighted Sobolev spaces. The weight function, which vanishes on the physical boundary, is crucial for the \textit{a priori} estimate, but introduces a loss of regularity near the boundary. Therefore, we employ the Sobolev inequalities and their weighted analogues to sharpen the regularity bound, providing improvements in both classical Sobolev spaces and H{ö}lder continuity estimates. The refined regularity estimate reinforces the plausibility of the quantized tensor train (QTT) method in [S. Li, Z. Wang, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp. 4405--4412] and provides convergence guarantees of the method. To further enhance the capacity of the method to solve the nonlinear filtering problem in a real-time manner, we reduce the complexity of the method under the assumption of a functional polyadic state drift $f$ and observation $h$. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to reaffirm our theory. For high-dimensional cubic sensor problems, our method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the particle filter (PF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Beyond this, for multi-mode problems, while the PF exhibits a lack of precision due to its stochastic nature and the EKF is constrained by its Gaussian assumption, the enhanced method provides an accurate reconstruction of the multi-mode conditional density function.

Exact Lagrangian fillings of twist-spun torus links

We construct exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian torus links $\Lambda(k, n-k)$ that are fixed by a Legendrian loop that acts by $2\pi\ell/n$ rotation. Using these rotationally symmetric fillings, we produce fillings of the corresponding Legendrian twist-spun tori. Our construction is combinatorial in nature, relating symmetric weakly separated collections and plabic graphs to symmetric Legendrian weaves via the T-shift procedure of Casals, Le, Sherman-Bennett, and Weng. The main technical ingredient in this process is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of maximal weakly separated collections of $k$-element subsets of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ that are fixed by addition of $\ell$ modulo $n$.

We present new combinatorial proofs of Nicomachus's Theorem for the sum of the third powers of the first n natural numbers. The key step is that we define a 4-dimensional block which comprises unit hyper-cubes. In our first proof we assemble 4 copies of this block to construct a rectangular solid. In our second proof we partition the block into two parts, then map and reassemble them into a solid whose shape is a step triangle along two coordinate axes, and is likewise on the other two. For corollaries we present a q-analogue of this identity using taxicab distance, and we interpret q-analogues from 4 different (sets of) authors, using taxicab distances from different starting points.

In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type. In the first paper of the series, we focus on the local problem of the form $\Delta u = u(u^2+v^2-1) + v(\alpha uv - \omega)$, $\Delta v = v(u^2+v^2-1) + u(\alpha uv - \omega)$, and prove that positive global solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\partial u/\partial x_3 > 0 > \partial v/\partial x_3$ must be one-dimensional.

Singular jump processes as generalized gradient flows
Jasper Hoeksema, Riccarda Rossi, Oliver Tse
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)
We extend the generalized gradient-flow framework of Peletier, Rossi, Savaré, and Tse to singular jump processes on abstract metric spaces, moving beyond the translation-invariant kernels considered in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$ in previous contributions. To address the analytical challenges posed by singularities, we introduce reflecting solutions, a new solution concept inspired by reflected Dirichlet forms, which ensures the validity of a chain rule and restores uniqueness. We establish existence, stability, and compactness results for these solutions by approximating singular kernels with regularized ones, and we show their robustness under such approximations. The framework encompasses dissipative and balanced solutions, clarifies their relations, and highlights the role of density properties of Lipschitz functions in upgrading weak formulations to reflecting solutions. As an application, we demonstrate the versatility of our theory to nonlocal stochastic evolutions on configuration spaces.

Least-energy solutions of the Brézis-Nirenberg problem in the non-coercive case in dimension $3$
Hussein Cheikh Ali, Bruno Premoselli
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, smooth domain of $\mathbb{R}^n, n \ge 3$ and $\lambda \ge 0$. We consider the celebrated Brézis-Nirenberg problem: \begin{equation}\label{eq:critlambda:abs} \tag{*}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
-\Delta u -\lambda u & =\left|u\right|^{2^*-2}u &\hbox{ in } \Omega,
u & = 0 \quad \text{ in } \partial \Omega,
\end{aligned}\right. \end{equation} where $2^* = \frac{2n}{n-2}$. When $n=3$ we investigate the existence of \emph{least-energy solutions} for this problem, that we define as having the lowest $L^{2^*}(\Omega)$ norm among all non-zero solutions. We prove that least-energy solutions of the Brézis-Nirenberg problem exist when $\lambda$ belongs to a left neighbourhood of any eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ that we explicitly characterise by a positive mass assumption. We obtain in particular the first \emph{existence} result for the Brézis-Nirenberg problem on a general smooth bounded domain $\Omega$ when $n=3$ and $\lambda \ge \Lambda_1$. In order to do this we introduce, for any $\lambda \ge 0$, a new variational problem inspired from spectral-theoretic considerations which is as follows: for any $u \in L^{2^*}(\Omega), u>0$ a.e., we consider the principal eigenvalue of $- \Delta-\lambda$ on the weighted space $L^2(\Omega, u^{2^*-2} dx)$, whose value we then minimise over the set of normalised weights $\Vert u \Vert_{2^*} = 1$. When $\lambda \ge \Lambda_1$ this defines a new, non-smooth variational problem for which we develop a variational theory. We prove that its minimisers exist under the aforementioned positive mass assumption and that they yield \emph{least-energy} solutions. We also obtain new results in the higher-dimensional case $n \ge 4$, where we show that the energy function of the Brézis-Nirenberg problem is discontinuous exactly at the eigenvalues of $- \Delta$.

We continue the study of regular ideals in regular inclusions of C*-algebras. Let $B \subseteq A$ be a regular inclusion of C*-algebras satisfying the ideal intersection property and with a faithful invariant pseudo-expectation. A complete description of the regular ideals of $A$ is given using the invariant regular ideals of $B$ and the pseudo-expectation. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a quotient by a regular ideal to preserve the faithful unique pseudo-expectation property.
Special attention is given throughout to pseudo-Cartan inclusions, i.e. inclusions having a Cartan envelope. We show that the quotient of a pseudo-Cartan inclusion by a regular ideal is again a pseudo-Cartan inclusion, and we describe the Cartan envelope of the quotient.

We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.

This is the third paper of the CayleyPy project applying artificial intelligence to problems in group theory. We announce the first public release of CayleyPy, an open source Python library for computations with Cayley and Schreier graphs. Compared with systems such as GAP and Sage, CayleyPy handles much larger graphs and performs several orders of magnitude faster.
Using CayleyPy we obtained about 200 new conjectures on Cayley and Schreier graphs, focused on diameters and growth. For many Cayley graphs of symmetric groups Sn we observe quasi polynomial diameter formulas: a small set of quadratic or linear polynomials indexed by n mod s. We conjecture that this is a general phenomenon, giving efficient diameter computation despite the problem being NP hard. We propose a refinement of the Babai type conjecture on diameters of Sn: n^2/2 + 4n upper bounds in the undirected case, compared to previous O(n^2) bounds. We also provide explicit generator families, related to involutions in a square with whiskers pattern, conjectured to maximize the diameter; search confirms this for all n up to 15. We further conjecture an answer to a question posed by V M Glushkov in 1968 on directed Cayley graphs generated by a cyclic shift and a transposition.
For nilpotent groups we conjecture an improvement of J S Ellenberg's results on upper unitriangular matrices over Z/pZ, showing linear dependence of diameter on p. Moreover.
Some conjectures are LLM friendly, naturally stated as sorting problems verifiable by algorithms or Python code. To benchmark path finding we created more than 10 Kaggle datasets. CayleyPy works with arbitrary permutation or matrix groups and includes over 100 predefined generators. Our growth computation code outperforms GAP and Sage up to 1000 times in speed and size.

Heat kernel asymptotics and analytic torsion on non-degenerate CR manifolds

Let $X$ be a compact oriented CR manifold of dimension $2n+1$, $n \ge 1$, with a nondegenerate Levi form of constant signature $(n_-, n_+)$. Suppose that condition $Y(q)$ holds at each point of $X$, we establish the small time asymptotics of the heat kernel of Kohn Laplacian. Suppose that condition $Y(q)$ fails, we establish the small time asymptotics of the kernel of the difference of the heat operator and Szegő projector. As an application we define the analytic torsion on a compact oriented CR manifold of dimension $2n+1$, $n \ge 1$, with a nondegenerate Levi form. Let $L^k$ be the $k$-th power of a CR complex line bundle $L$ over $X$. We also establish asymptotics of the analytic torsion with values in $L^k$ under certain natural assumptions.

Correlation decay for U(1) lattice Higgs theory: the case of small mass

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs model with inverse gauge coupling $\beta>0$ and Higgs length $\alpha>0$, in the ``complete breakdown of symmetry" regime. For lattice dimension $d\ge 2$ and (abelian) gauge group U(1), we prove that for any $m>0$, if $\alpha= m\beta$ and $\beta$ is large enough, the model exhibits exponential decay of correlations. This extends the classical result of Osterwalder and Seiler (1978), who required in addition that $m$ be sufficiently large. Our result also verifies a phase diagram from the physics literature, predicted by Fradkin and Shenker (1979). The proof is based on the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer cluster expansion around a massive Gaussian field, following the approach of Balaban et al. (1984).

A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3
William De Deyn, Ruben De Wolf, Vince Maes, Giovanni Samaey
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.

Higher-order Sobolev and Rellich inequalities via iterated Talenti's principle

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper we establish higher-order Sobolev and Rellich-type inequalities on non-compact Riemannian manifolds supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We highlight two notable settings: manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and having Euclidean volume growth (supporting Brendle's isoperimetric inequality) and manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature (satisfying the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture or supporting Croke's isoperimetric inequality). Our proofs rely on various symmetrization techniques, the key ingredient is an iterated Talenti's comparison principle. The non-iterated version is analogous to the main result of Chen and Li [J. Geom. Anal., 2023].

Spectral instability in the smooth Ponomarenko dynamo

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the kinematic dynamo equations for a passive vector in $\mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{T} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$ describing the evolution of a magnetic field with resistivity $\varepsilon>0$, that is transported by a given velocity field. For a broad class of $C^3$ velocity fields with helical geometry, we establish the existence of solutions that exhibit exponential growth over time. We construct an unstable eigenmode via detailed resolvent estimates of the corresponding linear operator, which we carry out by introducing suitable Green's functions that accurately approximate the local behaviour of the true system. This approach yields an explicit asymptotic expression for the growing mode, providing a sharp description of the instability mechanism. We first derive the results with $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}^2$ for a large class of velocity fields that includes finite energy examples. We then consider the case of domains with boundary, where $\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{T}$ denotes a periodic cylinder, annular cylinder, or the exterior of a cylinder, with the boundary conditions of perfectly conducting walls. Our results offer a rigorous and sharp mathematical justification for the physically conjectured process by which helical flows can sustain magnetic field generation in the Ponomarenko dynamo, with growth rate of order $\varepsilon^{1/3}$.

The square summability of the CLE complementary component diameters
Cillian Doherty, Jason Miller
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We show that the sum of the squares of the diameters of the complementary connected components of the CLE$_\kappa$ carpet/gasket is almost surely finite for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4) \cup (4, 8)$. This is a prerequisite for the application of a result of Ntalampekos which allows the CLE$_\kappa$ carpet/gasket to be uniformized to a round Sierpiński packing, in analogy with the classical Koebe uniformization theorem for finitely connected domains. Our result is new in the case that $\kappa \in (4,8)$ and we provide a new proof for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$. In both cases we use the link between CLE and space-filling SLE. The square-summability of diameters has been proved for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4]$ in unpublished work by Rohde and Werness using a different method. Our work completes the proof that this property holds for all $\kappa$ for which CLE$_\kappa$ is defined.

In contrast to the world-sheet of a fundamental string, the world-volume of stacked D-branes carries an Azumaya noncommutative structure ([L-Y1: Sec.\ 2] (D(1))), allowing it to directly serve as a probe into noncommutative target-spaces. This feature leads to a D-brane fantasy: {\it Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry between noncommutative Calabi-Yau spaces may be realized as different realizations of a supersymmetric D-brane world-volume quantum field theory exactly like the string world-sheet aspect for Mirror Symmetry between (commutative) Calabi-Yau manifolds}. Driven by this fantasy, in the current notes a class of noncommutative ringed spaces shadowing over a $C^\infty$-manifold with corners are constructed from gluing local noncommutative crepant resolutions of Gorenstein isolated singularities. Dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative target-spaces are realized as maps/morphisms from an Azumaya manifold with a fundamental module with a connection $\nabla$ thereto. The notion of $\nabla$-adjusted kinetic energy for such a map is given via the basic noncommutative differential calculus developed earlier in [L-Y4] (D(11.1)). This provides an action functional for dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative spaces in parallel to the Polyakov action functional for fundamental bosonic strings on a commutative target-space. This sets up a basic stage to begin with for the realization of the D-brane fantasy on Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry. Questions beyond are sampled along the discussion.

Resolvent degree ($\operatorname{RD}$) is an invariant of finite groups in terms of the complexity of their algebraic actions. We address the problem of bounding $\operatorname{RD}(G)$ for all finite simple groups using the methods established by Gómez-Gonzáles-Sutherland-Wolfson in terms of $\operatorname{RD}^{\leq d}_{\mathbb{C}}$-versality and special points. We give upper bounds on $\operatorname{RD}(\operatorname{PSU}(3,q))$ and $\operatorname{RD}(\operatorname{PSU}(2, q))$ in terms of classical invariant theory. In the $\operatorname{PSU}(3,q)$ case, stability of low-degree invariants permit an asymptotic bound on $\operatorname{RD}$ growing in $q$.

A new obstruction to Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture

Comments:

Operator Algebras (math.OA); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra containing a closed two-sided ideal $J$ and an operator system $X$. We enlarge $X$ to an operator system $\mathcal{S}(X,J)$ in $\mathbb{M}_2(A)$, and show that in order for $\mathcal{S}(X,J)$ to be hyperrigid, each $*$-representation of $C^*(X)$ annihilating $C^*(X)\cap J$ must admit a unique contractive completely positive extension from $X$ to the larger $C^*$-algebra $C^*(X)+J$. We leverage this implicit additional rigidity constraint to construct counterexamples to Arveson's hyperrigidity conjecture. A key condition in our construction is the mutual orthogonality of the atomic projection of $C^*(X)$ and the support projection of $J$, which we interpret as a new obstruction to the conjecture. Specializing to the case where $J$ is the ideal of compact operators on a Hilbert space, we recover as a by-product of our general construction the recent counterexample of Bilich and Dor-On. On the other hand, we find that such a pathology cannot be implemented using our construction when $A$ admits only finite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations, thereby illustrating that the obstruction only manifests itself in noncommutative settings.

Infinitely many groups exhibiting intermediate growth in maximal sum-free sets

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Given an Abelian groups $G$, denote $\mu(G)$ the size of its largest sum-free subset and $f_{\max}(G)$ the number of maximal sum-free sets in $G$. Confirming a prediction by Liu and Sharifzadeh, we prove that all even-order $G\ne \mathbb{Z}_2^k$ have exponentially fewer maximal sum-free sets than $\mathbb{Z}_2^k$, i.e. $f_{\max}(G) \leq 2^{(1/2-c)\mu(G)}$, where $c > 10^{-64}$.
We construct an infinite family of Abelian groups $G$ with intermediate growth in the number of maximal sum-free sets, i.e., with $
2^{(\frac{1}{2}+c)\mu(G)}\leq f_{\max}(G) \leq 3^{(\frac{1}{3}-c)\mu(G)}
$, where $c=10^{-4}$. This disproves a conjecture of Liu and Sharifzadeh and also answers a question of Hassler and Treglown in the negative.
Furthermore, we determine for every even-order group $G$, the number of maximal distinct sum-free sets (where a distinct sum is $a+b= c$ with distinct $a,b,c$): it is $ 2^{(1/2+o(1))\mu(G)}$
with the only exception being $G=\mathbb{Z}_2^k \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3$, when this function is $3^{(1/3+o(1))\mu(G)}$, refuting a conjecture of Hassler and Treglown.
Our proofs rely on a container theorem due to Green and Ruzsa. Other key ingredient is a sharp upper bound we establish on the number of maximal independent sets in graphs with given matching number, which interpolates between the classical results of Moon and Moser, and Hujter and Tuza. A special case of our bound implies that every $n$-vertex graph with a perfect matching has at most $2^{n/2}$ maximal independent sets, resolving another conjecture of Hassler and Treglown.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Of concern is the problem of reconstructing a space-dependent potential from boundary observations in the Caputo time-fractional diffusion equation, utilizing a stable and robust recovery method. We develop an algorithm to minimize the Kohn-Vogelius (KV) cost function, which measures the difference between the solutions of two excitations. The inverse potential problem is recast into an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a Kohn-Vogelius-type functional within a set of admissible potentials. We establish the well-posedness of this optimization problem by proving the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer and demonstrating its stability with respect to perturbations in the boundary data. Furthermore, we analyze the Fréchet differentiability of the KV functional and prove the Lipschitz continuity of its gradient. These theoretical results enable the development of a convergent conjugate gradient algorithm for numerical reconstruction. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are confirmed through several numerical examples in both one and two dimensions, including cases with noisy data.

Kaczmarz is one of the most prominent iterative solvers for linear systems of equations. Despite substantial research progress in recent years, the state-of-the-art Kaczmarz algorithms have not fully resolved the seesaw effect, a major impediment to convergence stability. Furthermore, while there have been advances in parallelizing the inherently sequential Kaczmarz method, no existing architecture effectively supports initialization-independent parallelism that fully leverages both CPU and GPU resources. This paper proposes the Randomized Greedy Double Block Extended Kaczmarz (RGDBEK) algorithm, a novel Kaczmarz approach designed for efficient large-scale linear system solutions. RGDBEK employs a randomized selection strategy for column and row blocks based on residual-derived probability distributions, thereby mitigating the traditional seesaw effect and enhancing convergence robustness. Theoretical analysis establishes linear convergence of the method under standard assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic random matrices and real-world sparse matrices from the SuiteSparse collection demonstrate that RGDBEK outperforms existing Kaczmarz variants, including GRK, FDBK, FGBK, and GDBEK, in both iteration counts and computational time. In addition, a hybrid parallel CPU-GPU implementation utilizing optimized sparse matrix-vector multiplications via the state-of-the-art storage format improves scalability and performance on large sparse problems. Applications in finite element discretizations, image deblurring, and noisy population modeling demonstrate the algorithm's versatility and effectiveness. Future work will explore extending RGDBEK to tensor systems, optimizing parallel parameter selection, and reducing communication overhead to further enhance efficiency and applicability.

On Kemeny's Constant for Markov Processes
P. J. Fitzsimmons
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The mean time taken by an irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space to hit a target chosen at random according to the stationary distribution does not depend on the initial state of the chain. This mean time is known as Kemeny's constant. I present a new approach, based on time reversal and a mean occupation time formula.
The method is used to prove a similar result for continuous-time Markov processes. In this generality, the constancy holds only almost surely with respect to the stationary distribution of the process, but with extra effort the exceptional set can be made to disappear in certain situations. Some examples are provided.

Random coverage of a manifold with boundary

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Let $A$ be a compact $d$-dimensional $C^2$ Riemannian manifold with boundary, embedded in ${\bf R}^m$ where $m \geq d \geq 2$, and let $B$ be a nice subset of $A$ (possibly $B=A$). Let $X_1,X_2, \ldots $ be independent random uniform points in $A$. Define the {\em coverage threshold} $R_n$ to be the smallest $r$ such that $B$ is covered by the geodetic balls of radius $r$ centred on $X_1,\ldots,X_n$. We obtain the limiting distribution of $R_n$ and also a strong law of large numbers for $R_n$ in the large-$n$ limit. For example, if $A$ has Riemannian volume 1 and its boundary has surface measure $|\partial A|$, and $B=A$, then if $d=3$ then ${\bf P}[n\pi R_n^3 - \log n - 2 \log (\log n) \leq x]$ converges to $\exp(-2^{-4}\pi^{5/3} |\partial A| e^{-2 x/3})$ and $(n \pi R_n^3)/(\log n) \to 1$ almost surely, while if $d=2$ then ${\bf P}[n \pi R_n^2 - \log n - \log (\log n) \leq x]$ converges to $\exp(- e^{-x}- |\partial A|\pi^{-1/2} e^{-x/2})$.
We generalize to allow for multiple coverage. For the strong laws of large numbers, we can relax the requirement that the underlying density on $A$ be uniform. For the limiting distribution, we have a similar result for Poisson samples. Our results still hold if we use Euclidean rather than geodetic balls.

Extremal Bounds on the Properties of Sigma and Albertson Indices for Non-Decreasing Degree Sequences
Jasem Hamoud, Duaa Abdullah
Comments:
16 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, Comments welcome!
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we establish bounds on the topological index -- the Sigma index -- focusing on analyzing the upper bound of its maximum value, which is known as $\sigma_{\max}(\mathcal{S}) = \max \{\sigma(\mathscr{G}) \mid \mathscr{G} \in \mathcal{S}\}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is a class of graphs. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for the Sigma index by leveraging degree sequences $\mathscr{D} = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, $\mathscr{R} = (t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m)$, and $\mathscr{A} = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r)$.
The minimum bound for the Albertson index related to the Sigma index bounds incorporates terms such as $\mathrm{irr}(T)$ and $\left\lfloor \frac{n-2}{a_r - t_m} \right\rfloor $. These results, rooted in extremal graph theory, enhance the understanding of topological indices in molecular and network analysis.

This paper examines Hamiltonian actions of non-compact Lie groups on homogeneous bounded domains $X$ in $\mathbb{C}^d$. In the main part, a Lie-theoretical condition for closed subgroups $H$ of the automorphism group of $X$ is described such that the symplectic reduction $\mu^{-1}(0)/H$ for the momentum map $\mu$ is a Stein manifold. Moreover, for another class of closed subgroups it is shown that the quotient $(H^\mathbb{C}\cdot X)/H^\mathbb{C}$ is a Stein manifold and the symplectic reduction $\mu^{-1}(0)/H$ is biholomorphic to this quotient.

The Conifold Gap Conjecture asserts that the polar part of the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau threefold near its conifold locus has a universal expression described by the logarithm of the Barnes $G$-function. In this paper, I prove the Conifold Gap Conjecture for the local projective plane. The proof relates the higher genus conifold Gromov-Witten generating series of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ to the thermodynamics of a certain statistical mechanical ensemble of repulsive particles on the positive half-line. As a corollary, this establishes the all-genus mirror principle for local $\mathbb{P}^2$ through the direct integration of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations.

A Stable-Set Bound and Maximal Numbers of Nash Equilibria in Bimatrix Games

Subjects:
Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Quint and Shubik (1997) conjectured that a non-degenerate n-by-n game has at most 2^n-1 Nash equilibria in mixed strategies. The conjecture is true for n at most 4 but false for n=6 or larger. We answer it positively for the remaining case n=5, which had been open since 1999. The problem can be translated to a combinatorial question about the vertices of a pair of simple n-polytopes with 2n facets. We introduce a novel obstruction based on the index of an equilibrium, which states that equilibrium vertices belong to two equal-sized disjoint stable sets of the graph of the polytope. This bound is verified directly using the known classification of the 159,375 combinatorial types of dual neighborly polytopes in dimension 5 with 10 facets. Non-neighborly polytopes are analyzed with additional combinatorial techniques where the bound is used for their disjoint facets.

We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.

Variational PINNs with tree-based integration and boundary element data in the modeling of multi-phase architected materials

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The current contribution develops a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN)-based framework for the analysis and design of multiphase architected solids. The elaborated VPINN methodology is based on the Petrov-Galerkin approach, with a deep neural network acting as trial function and local polynomials as test functions. For the analysis, a Galerkin Boundary Element Method (GBEM) scheme is developed to generate the mechanical field data, employing solely domain boundary information. The VPINN methodology is complemented by an adaptive, tree-based integration scheme for the evaluation of the weak-form integrals. Different double-phase material architectures are considered, with the VPINNs demonstrating their ability to capture the deformation fields with considerable accuracy. Moreover, the performance enhancement by the incorporation of additional semi-analytical information at auxiliary internal points is analyzed. Tree-based integration schemes are shown to be capable of robustly capturing inner material discontinuities upon substantial computational cost reductions. The results suggest that the proposed VPINN formulation offers comparative advantages in the modeling of multiphase architected materials compared to classical PINN formulations. The analysis paves the way for the development of variational physics-informed computational models for the mechanical analysis of complex architected multiphase materials and structures.

Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character: deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages (density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential 1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic purposes.

A Weighted Gradient Tracking Privacy-Preserving Method for Distributed Optimization
Furan Xie, Bing Liu, Li Chai
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a convolutional neural network.

We study a reaction-advection-diffusion model of a target-offender-guardian system designed to capture interactions between urban crime and policing. Using Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theory and spectral analysis, we establish rigorous conditions for both steady-state and Hopf bifurcations. These results identify critical thresholds of policing intensity at which spatially uniform equilibria lose stability, leading either to persistent heterogeneous hotspots or oscillatory crime-policing cycles. From a criminological perspective, such thresholds represent tipping points in guardian mobility: once crossed, they can lock neighborhoods into stable clusters of criminal activity or trigger recurrent waves of hotspot formation. Numerical simulations complement the theory, exhibiting stationary patterns, periodic oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. By explicitly incorporating law enforcement as a third interacting component, our framework extends classical two-equation models. It offers new tools for analyzing nonlinear interactions, bifurcations, and pattern formation in multi-agent social systems.

This paper introduces CARLA (spatially Constrained Anchor-based Recursive Location Assignment), a recursive algorithm for assigning secondary or any activity locations in activity-based travel models. CARLA minimizes distance deviations while integrating location potentials, ensuring more realistic activity distributions. The algorithm decomposes trip chains into smaller subsegments, using geometric constraints and configurable heuristics to efficiently search the solution space. Compared to a state-of-the-art relaxation-discretization approach, CARLA achieves significantly lower mean deviations, even under limited runtimes. It is robust to real-world data inconsistencies, such as infeasible distances, and can flexibly adapt to various priorities, such as emphasizing location attractiveness or distance accuracy. CARLA's versatility and efficiency make it a valuable tool for improving the spatial accuracy of activity-based travel models and agent-based transport simulations. Our implementation is available at this https URL.

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Fairly quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structures (such as symmetries or encodings) is a fundamental challenge for benchmarking quantum technologies. We introduce the "Reference-Contingent Complexity" (RCC). Its core idea is to utilize the quantum relative entropy to measure the extent to which a state deviates from its "structured vacuum" (the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace), thereby only pricing the generation of non-trivial information. We establish a central theorem, establishing that the RCC is a rigorous information-theoretic lower bound on universal quantum circuit complexity, a bound that features a linear leading term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction for the non-uniformity of the spectral distribution. Furthermore, we establish an operational protocol based on quantum hypothesis testing, which connects this theoretical lower bound to experimentally accessible observables. This work provides a structurally-fair yardstick for quantum technologies and offers a new perspective for exploring the intrinsic connection between computational cost and the generation of non-trivial information.

In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.

Zimmermann's forest formula is the corner stone of perturbative renormalization in QFT. By renormalizing individual Feynman graphs, it generates the UV finite S-matrix. This approach to renormalization makes the graph and all its forests center pieces in the theory of renormalization. On the other hand the positive geometry program delegate the role of Feynman graphs as secondary to the amplitude itself, which are generated by canonical forms associated to positive geometries. State of the art in this program is the convergence of S-matrix theory in local QFTs and string theory as the scattering amplitudes in QFT arise as integrals over certain moduli spaces. These integrals are known as curve integrals. For theories such as $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ theory with massive colored scalars, these integrals are divergent in the UV and have to be regularized. It is then natural to ask if there is a ``forest-like formula'' for these integrals which produce a renormalized amplitude without needing to explicitly invoke the forests associated to divergent subgraphs. In this paper, we initiate such a program by deriving forest-like formula for planar massive $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ amplitudes in $D = 4$ dimensions. Our analysis relies on the insightful manifestation of the forest formula derived by Brown and Kreimer in \cite{Brown:2011pj}, that lead us to a definition of ``tropical counter-term'' for the bare amplitude.

We study the superconformal index $Z(q)$ of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories in Cardy-like limits $\beta = \log \tfrac{1}{q} \to 0^+$, extending techniques recently developed in the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ context. For theories with vectorlike matter content we find on the first sheet ($q \to 1$) that $Z(q) \sim \beta^{-\#}$, where the exponent $\#$ is determined by a $multiscale\ decomposition$ of the BPS moduli space appearing in the localization formula for the index. On the second sheet ($q \to e^{2\pi i})$ we find $Z(q) \sim e^{\#/ \beta}$, and that the long-standing puzzle of apparent gauge-enhancing saddles is resolved (in the absence of Chern--Simons couplings) via a novel $Lorentzian\ factorization$ formula that establishes complete screening.
A key insight is the use of $Poisson\ resummation$, which streamlines the asymptotic analysis, sharpens the link to Kaluza--Klein effective field theory, and provides a dual description of parts of the BPS moduli space in terms of punctured surfaces. The Lorentzian factorization formula also emerges from Poisson resummation, though applied after a contour crossing in moduli space. This, in turn, hints at a correspondence between 3d monopoles and vortices via 2d duality.

A sharper Magnus expansion bound woven in binary branches
Harriet Apel, Toby Cubitt, Emilio Onorati
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The Magnus expansion provides an exponential representation of one-parameter operator families, expressed as a series expansion in its generators. This is useful for example in quantum mechanics for expressing a unitary evolution determined by a time-dependent Hamiltonian generator of the dynamics. The solution is constructed as a series expansion in terms of increasingly complex nested commutators that rapidly become challenging to compute directly. This work establishes a universal upper bound, agnostic to the generator, on the error incurred when the Magnus expansion is truncated at an arbitrary given order. The main technical ingredient of the proof is the binary tree representation introduced by Iserles and Norsett from which we derive a recursion formula to delimit the magnitude of any term in the expansion. We complement our analytic results for the truncation error with explicit calculation of the first 24 terms in the Magnus series, illustrating that they follow the scaling behaviour we have derived. With these findings we aim to contribute to the understanding of the accuracy and limitations of the Magnus expansion technique, and to provide a sharper bound for approximating quantum dynamics without requiring assumptions on the structure of their generators.

Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering, and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations, but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices; manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods, yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale systems.

Using Age of Information for Throughput Optimal Spectrum Sharing

Comments:
16 pages, 10 figures
Subjects:
Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We consider a spectrum sharing problem where two users attempt to communicate over N channels. The Primary User (PU) has prioritized transmissions and its occupancy on each channel over time can be modeled as a Markov chain. The Secondary User (SU) needs to determine which channels are free at each time-slot and attempt opportunistic transmissions. The goal of the SU is to maximize its own throughput, while simultaneously minimizing collisions with the PU, and satisfying spectrum access constraints. To solve this problem, we first decouple the multiple-channel problem into N single-channel problems. For each decoupled problem, we prove that there exists an optimal threshold policy that depends on the last observed PU occupancy and the freshness of this occupancy information. Second, we establish the indexability of the decoupled problems by analyzing the structure of the optimal threshold policy. Using this structure, we derive a Whittle index-based scheduling policy that allocates SU transmissions using the Age of Information (AoI) of accessed channels. We also extend our insights to PU occupancy models that are correlated across channels and incorporate learning of unknown Markov transition matrices into our policies. Finally, we provide detailed numerical simulations that demonstrate the performance gains of our approach.

Compositional System Dynamics: The Higher Mathematics Underlying System Dynamics Diagrams & Practice
Xiaoyan Li, Evan Patterson, Patricia L. Mabry, Nathaniel D. Osgood
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Category Theory (math.CT); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This work establishes a robust mathematical foundation for compositional System Dynamics modeling, leveraging category theory to formalize and enhance the representation, analysis, and composition of system models. Here, System Dynamics diagrams, such as stock & flow diagrams, system structure diagrams, and causal loop diagrams, are formulated as categorical constructs, enabling scalable, transparent, and systematic reasoning. By encoding these diagrams as data using attributed C-sets and utilizing advanced categorical tools like structured cospans, pushouts, pullbacks, and functor mappings, the framework supports modular composition, stratification, and seamless mapping between syntax and semantics.
The approach underwrites traditional practice with firm mathematical structure, facilitates the identification of certain forms of pathways and feedback loops, the detection of simple patterns within complex diagrams, common structure between diagrams, and structure-preserving mappings between diverse diagram types. Additionally, this framework supports alternative semantics, such as stochastic transition dynamics, extending beyond traditional ordinary differential equation (ODE) representations. Applications in compositional modeling, modularity, and team-based collaboration demonstrate the practical advantages of this advanced framework.
Future directions include integrating dimensional annotations, supporting hybrid and agent-based modeling paradigms, and expanding the framework's applicability to global and local temporal reasoning through temporal sheaves. By revealing and formalizing the hidden mathematical structure of System Dynamics diagrams, this work empowers practitioners to tackle complex systems with clarity, scalability, and rigor.

Online Learning for Optimizing AoI-Energy Tradeoff under Unknown Channel Statistics

Subjects:
Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We consider a real-time monitoring system where a source node (with energy limitations) aims to keep the information status at a destination node as fresh as possible by scheduling status update transmissions over a set of channels. The freshness of information at the destination node is measured in terms of the Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this setting, a natural tradeoff exists between the transmission cost (or equivalently, energy consumption) of the source and the achievable AoI performance at the destination. This tradeoff has been optimized in the existing literature under the assumption of having a complete knowledge of the channel statistics. In this work, we develop online learning-based algorithms with finite-time guarantees that optimize this tradeoff in the practical scenario where the channel statistics are unknown to the scheduler. In particular, when the channel statistics are known, the optimal scheduling policy is first proven to have a threshold-based structure with respect to the value of AoI (i.e., it is optimal to drop updates when the AoI value is below some threshold). This key insight was then utilized to develop the proposed learning algorithms that surprisingly achieve an order-optimal regret (i.e., $O(1)$) with respect to the time horizon length.

A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids
Christian Tantardini
Subjects:
Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Conventional diagnostics of Weyl points -- Berry flux on small spheres and $k \cdot p$ linearization -- are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center and radius, gauge smoothing, charting, and local frame transport) that introduce algorithmic arbitrariness in first-principles workflows. We propose a \emph{local, basis-free} criterion built from the octonionic structure on $\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we construct a unit octonion field and its octonionic connection; contracting three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$--invariant three-form yields a pseudoscalar density whose sign equals the Weyl chirality. A vanishing octonionic associator at leading order certifies that the local problem closes inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane, while a nonzero density identifies a Weyl point. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge-seam choices. In the linear regime we prove equivalence with the conventional diagnostics (Chern charge on a small sphere and $\mathrm{sgn}\det v$). We outline a practical algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and provide self-consistency checks based on stencil refinement and the associator norm. The \emph{octonionic Weyl point criterion} streamlines chirality assignment in high-throughput searches and offers an intrinsic warning signal in the presence of band entanglement or proximity to multi-fold touchings.

Title:
Optimization-centric cutting feedback for semiparametric models

Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Computation (stat.CO)
Modern statistics deals with complex models from which the joint model used for inference is built by coupling submodels, called modules. We consider modular inference where the modules may depend on parametric and nonparametric components. In such cases, a joint Bayesian inference is highly susceptible to misspecification across any module, and inappropriate priors for nonparametric components may deliver subpar inferences for parametric components, and vice versa. We propose a novel ``optimization-centric'' approach to cutting feedback for semiparametric modular inference, which can address misspecification and prior-data conflicts. The proposed generalized cut posteriors are defined through a variational optimization problem for generalized posteriors where regularization is based on Rényi divergence, rather than Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), and variational computational methods are developed. We show empirically that using Rényi divergence to define the cut posterior delivers more robust inferences than KLD. We derive novel posterior concentration results that accommodate the Rényi divergence and allow for semiparametric components, greatly extending existing results for cut posteriors that were derived for parametric models and KLD. We demonstrate these new methods in a benchmark toy example and two real examples: Gaussian process adjustments for confounding in causal inference and misspecified copula models with nonparametric marginals.

Barycentric decompositions for extensive monotone divergences

42 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We study sets of divergences or dissimilarity measures in a generalized real-algebraic setting which includes the cases of classical and quantum multivariate divergences. We show that a special subset of divergences, the so-called test spectrum, characterizes the rest of the divergences through barycentres and that the extreme points of relevant convex subsets of general divergences are contained within the test spectrum. Only some special parts of the test spectrum may contain non-extreme elements. We are able to fully characterize the test spectrum in the case of classical multivariate divergences. The quantum case is much more varied, and we demonstrate that essentially all the bivariate and multivariate quantum divergences suggested previously in literature are within the test spectrum and extreme within the set of all quantum (multivariate) divergences. This suggests that the variability of quantum divergences is real since all the previously suggested divergences are independent of each other.

Overcoming limitations on gate fidelity in noisy static exchange-coupled surface qubits

Recent experiments demonstrated that the spin state of individual atoms on surfaces can be quantum-coherently controlled through all-electric electron spin resonance. By constructing interacting arrays of atoms this results in an atomic-scale qubit platform. However, the static exchange coupling between qubits, limited lifetime and polarization of the initial state, impose significant limits on high-fidelity quantum control. We address this issue using open quantum systems simulation and quantum optimal control theory. We demonstrate the conditions under which high-fidelity operations ($\mathcal{F} \gtrsim 0.9$) are feasible in this qubit platform, and show how the Krotov method of quantum optimal control theory adapts to specific noise sources to outperform the conventional Rabi drivings. Finally, we re-examine the experimental setup used in the initial demonstration of this qubit platform and propose optimized experimental designs to maximize gate fidelity in this platform.

Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate connection.

Virtual Quantum Markov Chain of four-qubit systems
Zhixing Chen, Lin Chen
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We extend the framework of virtual quantum Markov chains (VQMCs) from tripartite systems to the four-qubit setting. Structural criteria such as the kernel-inclusion condition are analyzed, showing that they are necessary but not sufficient for the existence of a valid recovery map. By explicit examples, we demonstrate that the four-qubit W state admits a recovery channel and thus qualifies as a VQMC, while the GHZ state does not. We further provide semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations to test recoverability and quantify sampling overhead, and establish the non-convexity of the VQMC set through mixed-state counterexamples. These results supply both theoretical insights and computational tools for studying correlations and recoverability in multipartite quantum systems.

Optimal estimation for regression discontinuity design with binary outcomes
Takuya Ishihara, Masayuki Sawada, Kohei Yata
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
We develop a finite-sample optimal estimator for regression discontinuity designs when the outcomes are bounded, including binary outcomes as the leading case. Our finite-sample optimal estimator achieves the exact minimax mean squared error among linear shrinkage estimators with nonnegative weights when the regression function of a bounded outcome lies in a Lipschitz class. Although the original minimax problem involves an iterating (n+1)-dimensional non-convex optimization problem where n is the sample size, we show that our estimator is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. A key advantage of our estimator is that the Lipschitz constant is the only tuning parameter. We also propose a uniformly valid inference procedure without a large-sample approximation. In a simulation exercise for small samples, our estimator exhibits smaller mean squared errors and shorter confidence intervals than conventional large-sample techniques which may be unreliable when the effective sample size is small. We apply our method to an empirical multi-cutoff design where the sample size for each cutoff is small. In the application, our method yields informative confidence intervals, in contrast to the leading large-sample approach.

A Novel Mathematical Model of Protein Interactions from the Perspective of Electron Delocalization
Naoto Morikawa
Comments:
36 pages, 12 figures

Biomolecules (q-bio.BM); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Proteins are the workhorse molecules of the cell and perform their biological functions by binding to other molecules through physical contact. Protein function is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein (allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for protein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein communication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how binding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at another distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery in 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein interactions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the discrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the concept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum chemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the definition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete differential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I hope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study chemistry and molecular biology.

Driver Identification and PCA Augmented Selection Shrinkage Framework for Nordic System Price Forecasting
Yousef Adeli Sadabad, Mohammad Reza Hesamzadeh, Gyorgy Dan, Matin Bagherpour, Darryl R. Biggar
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
The System Price (SP) of the Nordic electricity market serves as a key reference for financial hedge contracts such as Electricity Price Area Differentials (EPADs) and other risk management instruments. Therefore, the identification of drivers and the accurate forecasting of SP are essential for market participants to design effective hedging strategies. This paper develops a systematic framework that combines interpretable drivers analysis with robust forecasting methods. It proposes an interpretable feature engineering algorithm to identify the main drivers of the Nordic SP based on a novel combination of K-means clustering, Multiple Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (MSTD), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Then, it applies principal component analysis (PCA) to the identified data matrix, which is adapted to the downstream task of price forecasting to mitigate the issue of imperfect multicollinearity in the data. Finally, we propose a multi-forecast selection-shrinkage algorithm for Nordic SP forecasting, which selects a subset of complementary forecast models based on their bias-variance tradeoff at the ensemble level and then computes the optimal weights for the retained forecast models to minimize the error variance of the combined forecast. Using historical data from the Nordic electricity market, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms individual input models uniformly, robustly, and significantly, while maintaining a comparable computational cost. Notably, our systematic framework produces superior results using simple input models, outperforming the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Furthermore, we show that our approach also exceeds the performance of several well-established practical forecast combination methods.

In particular, we establish this reformulation for two discrete models -- the basic type and the strip type -- as well as for the continuum limit of dynamical triangulations.

A detailed analysis of the diffusive Stochastic Master Equation (SME) for qubit/cavity systems with dispersive coupling is provided. This analysis incorporates classical input signals and output signals (measurement outcomes through homodyne detection). The dynamics of the qubit/cavity density operator is shown to converge exponentially towards a slow invariant manifold, parameterized via a time-varying deterministic Kraus map by the density operator of a fictitious qubit. This fictitious qubit is governed by a SME incorporating the classical input/output signals. Extension where the qubit is replaced by any qudit dispersively coupled to an arbitrary set of modes with collective input/output classical signals.

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We discuss a general action for a particle in AdS$_3$ using the non-linear realization framework. Critical sectors are found and characterized in terms of the parameters appearing in the Lagrangian, generalizing the known results for AdS$_3$/SO(2). A study of the dynamics of this system and of the geometrical meaning of the new terms in the action is also undertaken.
Using two chiral copies of the general AdS$_2$ Lagrangian, we obtain an AdS$_3$ Lagrangian which is the same, although expressed in different variables, that the general AdS$_3$ one, and from this one can identify the extra gauge transformations appearing in the critical sectors of the AdS$_3$ theory. A differential equation connecting the AdS$_2 \times$ AdS$_2$ chiral variables to the AdS$_3$ covariant ones is obtained, and it is explicitly solved at first order in the Goldstone bosons associated to boosts and rotations.

Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning
Carson Dudley, Marisa Eisenberg
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions. SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited regimes.

A Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimator of the American Multi-modal Energy System

Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate change demands a host of changes across at least four critical energy infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system. In the context of the United States, this paper refers to this system-of-systems as ``The American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES)". These combined changes necessitate an understanding of the AMES interdependencies, both structurally and behaviorally, to develop and enact effective policies. This work focuses on behavioral analysis methods to provide examples of how to analyze system behavior and the critical matter and energy flows through the system. Building upon past works, two regions of the AMES are modeled, and their behavior is analyzed using Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT). More specifically, the work presents a weighted least square error state estimation model of the AMES. State estimation has played a major role in the operation and development of the American Electric Power System. This work extends the state estimation analysis beyond the single-operand electric grid environment into the heterogeneous environment of the AMES. Employing a data-driven and model-based systems engineering approach in combination with HFGT, a Weighted Least Squares Error Hetero-functional Graph State Estimation (WLSEHFGSE) optimization program is developed to estimate the optimal flows of mass and energy through the AMES. This work is the first to integrate state estimation methods with HFGT. Furthermore, it demonstrates how such a WLSEHFGSE recovers the mass and energy flows in a system-of-systems like the AMES with asset-level granularity.

A failure mode dependent continuum damage model for laminated composites with optimized model parameters : Application to curved beams

Subjects:

In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and strength properties of the material, respectively.

We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++ Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic. These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.

Asymptotically Optimal Problem-Dependent Bandit Policies for Transfer Learning

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We study the non-contextual multi-armed bandit problem in a transfer learning setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) <= L_k. In this framework, we first derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters (d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.

The method is valid for local or global unitary symmetries and works for theories with or without spontaneous or explicit symmetry breaking. We extend the method for other conserved charges as flavors (horizontal symmetries) and color (QCD).

This paper investigates the performance of terahertz~(THz) wireless systems over the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{F}$ fading channels with beam misalignment and mobility. New expressions are derived for the probability density, cumulative distribution, and moment generating functions, as well as higher-order moments of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. Building upon the aforementioned expressions, we extract novel formulas for the outage probability, symbol error probability, and average channel capacity. Asymptotic metrics are also deduced, which provide useful insights. Monte Carlo simulations results are presented to support the derived analytical framework.

We study multivariate linear regression under Gaussian covariates in two settings, where data may be erased or corrupted by an adversary under a coordinate-wise budget. In the incomplete data setting, an adversary may inspect the dataset and delete entries in up to an $\eta$-fraction of samples per coordinate; a strong form of the Missing Not At Random model. In the corrupted data setting, the adversary instead replaces values arbitrarily, and the corruption locations are unknown to the learner. Despite substantial work on missing data, linear regression under such adversarial missingness remains poorly understood, even information-theoretically. Unlike the clean setting, where estimation error vanishes with more samples, here the optimal error remains a positive function of the problem parameters. Our main contribution is to characterize this error up to constant factors across essentially the entire parameter range. Specifically, we establish novel information-theoretic lower bounds on the achievable error that match the error of (computationally efficient) algorithms. A key implication is that, perhaps surprisingly, the optimal error in the missing data setting matches that in the corruption setting-so knowing the corruption locations offers no general advantage.

On a Neutral Host-Virus Model with Recombination

Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Probability (math.PR)
Motivated by observations in sequence data of herpesviruses, we introduce a multi-locus model for the joint evolution of different genotypes in a virus population that is distributed across a population of hosts. In the model, virus particles replicate, recombine, and mutate within their hosts at rates that act on different time scales. Furthermore, virus particles are exchanged between hosts at reinfection events and hosts are replaced by primary infected hosts when they die. We determine the asymptotic type distribution observed in a single host in the limit of large host and virus populations under asymptotic rate assumptions by tracing back the ancestry of the sample. The proposed model may serve as a null model for the evolution of virus populations that are capable of persistence and can be used to estimate the strengths of different evolutionary forces driving genetic diversity, see also [4].

Policy Gradient Bounds in Multitask LQR

Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We analyze the performance of policy gradient in multitask linear quadratic regulation (LQR), where the system and cost parameters differ across tasks. The main goal of multitask LQR is to find a controller with satisfactory performance on every task. Prior analyses on relevant contexts fail to capture closed-loop task similarities, resulting in conservative performance guarantees. To account for such similarities, we propose bisimulation-based measures of task heterogeneity. Our measures employ new bisimulation functions to bound the cost gradient distance between a pair of tasks in closed loop with a common stabilizing controller. Employing these measures, we derive suboptimality bounds for both the multitask optimal controller and the asymptotic policy gradient controller with respect to each of the tasks. We further provide conditions under which the policy gradient iterates remain stabilizing for every system. For multiple random sets of certain tasks, we observe that our bisimulation-based measures improve upon baseline measures of task heterogeneity dramatically.

In particular, we show that for connected, $K_{h+1}$-minor-free, edge-transitive, twin-free, finite graphs the non-abelian composition factors of the automorphism group have bounded order. We use this to show that the automorphism groups of finite graphs of bounded Hadwiger number are obtained by repeated group extensions using abelian groups, symmetric groups and groups of bounded order.

Maximum Entropy Random Walks: the Infinite Setting and the Example of Spider Networks with their Scaling Limits
Duboux Thibaut (IMB), Offret Yoann (IMB)
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this article, we establish solid foundations for the study of Maximal Entropy Random Walks (MERWs) on infinite graphs. We introduce a generalized definition that extends the original concept, along with rigorous tools for handling this generalization. Unlike conventional simple random walks, which maximize entropy locally, MERWs maximize entropy globally along their paths, marking a significant paradigm shift and presenting substantial computational challenges. Originally introduced by physicists and computer scientists in [1], MERWs have connections to concepts such as Parry measures and Doob h-transforms. Our approach addresses the challenges of existence, uniqueness, and approximation, illustrated through examples and counterexamples. Even in the infinite setting, MERWs continue to maximize the entropy rate, albeit in a less direct manner. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of weighted spider networks, including scaling limits, revealing various phenomena characteristic of the infinite framework, notably a phase transition. A unified proof of scaling limits based on submartingale problems is presented. Furthermore, we consider some extended models, where the spider lattice provides valuable insights, highlighting the complexity of studying these walks for general infinite weighted graphs.

We exhibit a higher-level analogue of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) reciprocity for twisted current algebras for each positive integer, which recovers the original one (established by Bennett, Berenstein, Chari, Ion, Khoroshkin, Loktev, and Manning) as its level-one case. This work brings theta functions and modular forms into the theory of symmetric polynomials. Furthermore, we establish branching properties for both versions of Demazure modules and provide a new interpretation of level-restricted generalized Kostka polynomials in terms of symmetric polynomials.

We find out some relations between the classical Adams spectral sequences for stunted real projective spectra, the Borel $C_2$-equivariant Adams spectral sequence for the 2-completed sphere, and the genuine $C_2$-equivariant Adams spectral sequence for the 2-completed sphere. This allows us to understand the genuine $C_2$-equivariant Adams spectral sequence from the Borel Adams spectral sequences. We show that the Borel Adams spectral sequence is computable as a classical Adams spectral sequence.

DRAG: Distributed Resource Allocation Games over Multiple Interacting Coalitions
Jialing Zhou, Guanghui Wen, Yuezu Lv, Tao Yang, Guanrong Chen
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Despite many distributed resource allocation (DRA) algorithms have been reported in literature, it is still unknown how to allocate the resource optimally over multiple interacting coalitions. One major challenge in solving such a problem is that, the relevance of the decision on resource allocation in a coalition to the benefit of others may lead to conflicts of interest among these coalitions. Under this context, a new type of multi-coalition game is formulated in this paper, termed as resource allocation game, where each coalition contains multiple agents that cooperate to maximize the coalition-level benefit while subject to the resource constraint described by a coupled equality. Inspired by techniques such as variable replacement, gradient tracking and leader-following consensus, two new kinds of DRA algorithms are developed respectively for the scenarios where the individual benefit of each agent explicitly depends on the states of itself and some agents in other coalitions, and on the states of all the game participants. It is shown that the proposed algorithms can converge linearly to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the multi-coalition game while satisfying the resource constraint during the whole NE-seeking process. Finally, the validity of the present allocation algorithms is verified by numerical simulations.

$p$-adic hypergeometric function related with $p$-adic multiple polylogarithms

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
This paper introduces a $p$-adic analogue of Gauss's hypergeometric function, constructed via a method that is distinct from distinct from Dwork's approach. The idea of our construction is motivated by the Ohno-Zagier formula, which is elucidated through the relationship between the hypergeometric differential equation and the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation. We develop a rigorous framework for the residue-wise analytic prolongation of our $p$-adic hypergeometric function by exploring its relationship with $p$-adic multiple polylogarithms. Through a detailed analysis of its local behavior near the point $1$, we show a $p$-adic version of Gauss hypergeometric theorem for the function.

The proof is based on the use of a Margulis function, tools from incidence geometry, and the spectral gap of the ambient space.

Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Markov Decision Processes (Mdps) form a versatile framework used to model a wide range of optimization problems. The Mdp model consists of sets of states, actions, time steps, rewards, and probability transitions. When in a given state and at a given time, the decision maker's action generates a reward and determines the state at the next time step according to the probability transition function. However, Mdps assume that the decision maker knows the state of the controlled dynamical system. Hence, when one needs to optimize controlled dynamical systems under partial observation, one often turns toward the formalism of Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (Pomdp). Pomdps are often untractable in the general case as Dynamic Programming suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Instead of focusing on the general Pomdps, we present a subclass where transitions and observations mappings are deterministic: Deterministic Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (Det-Pomdp). That subclass of problems has been studied by (Littman, 1996) and (Bonet, 2009). It was first considered as a limit case of Pomdps by Littman, mainly used to illustrate the complexity of Pomdps when considering as few sources of uncertainties as possible. In this paper, we improve on Littman's complexity bounds. We then introduce and study an even simpler class: Separated Det-Pomdps and give some new complexity bounds for this class. This new class of problems uses a property of the dynamics and observation to push back the curse of dimensionality.

Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.

The propagation of charged particles through a scattering medium in the presence of a magnetic field can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation with Lorentz force. This model is studied both, from a theoretical and a numerical point of view. A particular trace estimate is derived for the relevant function spaces to clarify the meaning of boundary values. Existence of a weak solution is then proven by the Rothe method. In the second step of our investigations, a fully practical discretization scheme is proposed based on an implicit Euler method for the energy variable and a spherical-harmonics finite-element discretization with respect to the remaining variables. A complete error analysis of the resulting scheme is given and numerical test are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed method.

Subjects:

We construct the parabolic version and the reductive version of the integral de Rham moduli stacks of Langlands parameters ($p>3$). We allow the group to be arbitrarily ramified.
We propose that the top Chow group of the reduced Emerton-Gee stack $\mathcal{X}_{^L\!G}$ is isomorphic to that of the moduli of Weil-Deligne representations valued in $^L\!B$, where $^L\!B$ is a Borel of $^L\!G$. The latter bears a concrete description by Serre weights corrected by the Kottwitz homomorphism.
We explicitly define such a map using parabolic de Rham moduli stacks as the composition of a chain of tautological maps, and confirm it is an isomorphism for (1) algebraic tori, (2) unitary, orthogonal and symplectic groups, (3) tame groups when restricted to the cyclotomic-free part of the Chow groups.

Complete complex Finsler metrics and uniform equivalence of the Kobayashi metric

Subjects:

In this paper, first of all, according to Lu's and Zhang's works about the curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded domain and the properties of the squeezing functions, we obtain that Bergman curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain is bounded. Secondly, by the property of curvature symmetry on a Kähler manifold, we have the property: if holomorphic sectional curvature of a Kähler manifold is bounded, we can deduce that its sectional curvature is bounded. After that, applying to the Schwarz lemma from a complete Kähler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we get that a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain admit complete strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metrics such that their holomorphic sectional curvature is bounded from above by a negative constant. Finally, by the Schwarz lemma from a complete Kähler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we prove the uniform equivalences of the Kobayashi metric and Carathéodory metric on a bounded strongly convex domain with smooth boundary.

We study function fields of curves over a base field $K$ which is either a global field or a large field having a separable field extension of degree divisible by $4$. We show that, for any such function field, Hilbert's 10th Problem has a negative answer, the valuation rings containing $K$ are uniformly existentially definable, and finitely generated integrally closed $K$-subalgebras are definable by a universal-existential formula. In order to obtain these results, we develop further the usage of local-global principles for quadratic forms in function fields to definability of certain subrings. We include a first systematic presentation of this general method, without restriction on the characteristic.

Six dimensional counterexample to the Milnor Conjecture

We extend our previous work by building a smooth complete manifold $(M^6,g,p)$ with $\mathrm{Ric}\geq 0$ and whose fundamental group $\pi_1(M^6)=\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is infinitely generated. The example is built with a variety of interesting geometric properties. To begin the universal cover $\tilde M^6$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$, which turns out to be rather subtle as this diffeomorphism is increasingly twisting at infinity. The curvature of $M^6$ is uniformly bounded, and in fact decaying polynomially. The example is {\it locally} noncollapsed, in that $\mathrm{Vol}(B_1(x))>v>0$ for all $x\in M$. Finally, the space is built so that it is {\it almost } globally noncollapsed. Precisely, for every $\eta>0$ there exists radii $r_j\to \infty$ such that $\mathrm{Vol}(B_{r_j}(p))\geq r_j^{6-\eta}$. The broad outline for the construction of the example will closely follow the scheme introduced in our previous work. The six-dimensional case requires a couple of new points, in particular the corresponding Ricci curvature control on the equivariant mapping class group is harder and cannot be done in the same manner.

Multi-representation associated to the numbering of a subbasis and formal inclusion relations
Emmanuel Rauzy
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
We revisit Dieter Spreen's notion of a representation associated to a numbered basis equipped with a strong inclusion relation. We show that by relaxing his requirements, we obtain different classically considered representations as subcases, including representations considered by Grubba, Weihrauch and Schröder. We show that the use of an appropriate strong inclusion relation guarantees that the representation associated to a computable metric space seen as a topological space always coincides with the Cauchy representation. We also show how the use of a formal inclusion relation guarantees that when defining multi-representations on a set and on one of its subsets, the obtained multi-representations will be compatible, i.e. inclusion will be a computable map. The proposed definitions are also more robust under change of equivalent bases.

Structural transitions in interacting lattice systems

We consider two-dimensional systems of point particles located on rectangular lattices and interacting via pairwise potentials. The goal of this paper is to investigate the phase transitions (and their nature) at fixed density for the minimal energy of such systems. The 2D rectangle lattices we consider have an elementary cell of sides $a$ and $b$, the aspect ratio is defined as $\Delta=b/a$ and the inverse particle density $A = a b$; therefore, the ``symmetric'' state with $\Delta=1$ corresponds to the square lattice and the ``non-symmetric'' state to the rectangular lattice with $\Delta\ne 1$. For certain types of the interaction potential, by changing continuously the particle density, such lattice systems undertake at a specific value of the (inverse) particle density $A^*$ a structural transition from the symmetric to the non-symmetric state. The structural transition can be either of first order ($\Delta$ unstick from its symmetric value $\Delta=1$ discontinuously) or of second order ($\Delta$ unstick from $\Delta=1$ continuously); the first and second-order phase transitions are separated by the so-called tricritical point. We develop a general theory on how to determine the exact values of the transition densities and the location of the tricritical point. The general theory is applied to the double Yukawa and Yukawa-Coulomb potentials.

The Johnson-Morita theory for the handlebody group

The Johnson-Morita theory is an algebraic approach to the mapping class group of a surface, in which one considers its action on the successive nilpotent quotients of the fundamental group of the surface. In this paper, we develop an analogue of this theory for the handlebody group, i.e. the mapping class group of a 3-dimensional handlebody. Thus, we obtain a filtration on the handlebody group, prove that its associated graded embeds into a Lie algebra of "special derivations", and give an explicit diagrammatic description of this graded Lie algebra in terms of "oriented trees with beads". Our new diagrammatic method reveals part of the richness of the algebraic structure of the handlebody group, which lies mainly in the subgroup generated by Dehn twists along meridians: the so-called "twist group". As an application, we obtain that each term of the associated graded of the lower central series of the twist group is infinitely generated.

Half Space Property in RCD(K,N) spaces

The goal of this note is to prove the Half Space Property for RCD(0,N) spaces, namely that if (X,d,m) is a parabolic RCD(0,N) space and $ C \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$ is locally the boundary of a perimeter minimizing set and it is contained in a half space, then $C$ is a locally finite union of horizontal slices.
The same result is proved for RCD(K,N) spaces, for any $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and $N\in (1,\infty)$, under the stronger assumption that $C$ is the boundary of a \emph{globally} perimeter minimizing set.
As a consequence, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Half Space Theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a parabolic smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary), satisfying a Ricci curvature lower bound. On the way of proving the Half Space Property, we also extend to the RCD setting some classical results on Green's functions and parabolic manifolds.

This is the first such example and shows that even in low dimensions, not every limit point of the measure-valued dynamics needs to be a time-stationary measure.

We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $4d$ $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) half Seiberg--Witten spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hslash$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Doł{ę}ga--Osuga.

In this paper, in the case that $R,S,I$ are finite we obtain a concrete formula of the asymptotic ratio of $p_{R>S,I}(n)$ to $p_{RSI}(n)$. We also propose a conjecture in the case that $R,S$ are certain infinite arithmetic progressions.

The paper reviews some parts of classical potential theory with applications to two dimensional fluid dynamics, in particular vortex motion. Energy and forces within a system of point vortices are similar to those for point charges when the vortices are kept fixed, but the dynamics is different in the case of free vortices. Starting from Bernoulli's equation we derive these laws. Letting the number of vortices tend to infinity leads in the limit to considerations of capacity, harmonic measure and many other notions in potential theory. In particular various kinds of Green functions have a central role in the paper, where we make a difference between electrostatic and hydrodynamic Green function.
We also consider the corresponding concepts in the case of closed Riemann surfaces provided with a metric. From a canonically defined monopole Green function we rederive much of the classical theory of harmonic and analytic forms. In the final section of the paper we return to the planar case, then reappearing in form of a symmetric Riemann surface, the Schottky double. Bergman kernels, electrostatic and hydrodynamic, come up naturally, and associated to the Green function the is a certain Robin function which is important for vortex motion and which also relates to capacity functions in classical potential theory.

In this paper, a dissipative version of a compressible one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for a mixture of two compressible heat conducting gases is considered. The complete existence proof for weak solutions to this system was addressed as an open problem in [6, Section 5]. The purpose of this paper is to prove the global in time existence of weak solutions to the one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for arbitrary large initial data. The goal is achieved in three steps. Firstly, the given system is transformed into a new one which possesses the "Navier-Stokes-Fourier" structure. Secondly, the new system is solved by an adaptation of the Feireisl--Lions approach for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. Eventually, the existence of a weak solution to the original one velocity Baer--Nunziato system using the almost uniqueness property of renormalized solutions to pure transport equations.

Expected Optimal Distances of Random Bipartite Matching in $D$-dimensional Spaces: Approximate Formulas and Applications to Mobility Services
Shiyu Shen, Yuhui Zhai, Yanfeng Ouyang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Although many well-known algorithms can solve each bipartite matching problem instance efficiently, it remains an open question how one could estimate the expected optimal matching distance for arbitrary numbers of randomly distributed vertices in $D$-dimensional spaces (referred to as a random bipartite matching problem, or RBMP). This paper proposes a comprehensive modeling framework that yields closed-form approximate formulas for estimating the expected optimal matching cost across three interrelated but increasingly complex versions of RBMPs: (i) RBMP-I, where edge costs are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.); (ii) RBMP-S, where edge costs represent distances between vertices uniformly distributed on the surface of a hyper-sphere in a $D$-dimensional Euclidean space; and (iii) RBMP-B, where the vertices are uniformly distributed in a hyper-ball within a $D$-dimensional L$^p$ metric space. A series of Monte-Carlo simulation experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed formulas under varying parameter combinations. These proposed distance estimates could be key for strategic performance evaluation and resource planning in a wide variety of application contexts. As an illustration, we focus on on-demand mobility services (e.g., e-hailing taxi system). We show how the proposed distance formulas provide a theoretical foundation for the empirically assumed Cobb-Douglas matching function in the field, and reveal conditions under which it can work well. Our formulas can also be easily incorporated into optimization models to select on-demand mobility operation strategies (e.g., whether newly arriving customers shall be instantly matched or pooled into a batch for matching). Agent-based simulations are conducted to verify the predicted performance of the demand pooling strategy for two types of e-hailing taxi systems.

We propose an inertial variant of the strongly convergent inexact proximal-point (PP) method of Solodov and Svaiter (2000) for monotone inclusions. We prove strong convergence of our main algorithm under less restrictive assumptions on the inertial parameters when compared to previous analysis of inertial PP-type algorithms, which makes our method of interest even in finite-dimensional settings. We also performed an iteration-complexity analysis and applied our main algorithm to variational inequalities for monotone operators, obtaining strongly convergent (inertial) variants of Korpolevich's extragradient, forward-backward and Tseng's modified forward-backward methods. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that our strongly convergent variant of Tseng's modified forward-backward method performs well on certain matrix game problems.

The B superA graph of $G$ is an undirected graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $g, h \in G$ are adjacent if $[g] = [h]$ or there exist $x \in [g]$ and $y \in [h]$ such that $x$ and $y$ are adjacent in the A graph of $G$. In this paper, we compute spectrum of equality/conjugacy supercommuting graphs of dihedral/dicyclic groups and show that these graphs are not integral.

We characterize the complexity functions of subshifts up to asymptotic equivalence. The complexity function of every aperiodic function is non-decreasing, submultiplicative and grows at least linearly. We prove that conversely, every function satisfying these conditions is asymptotically equivalent to the complexity function of a recurrent subshift, equivalently, a recurrent infinite word. Our construction is explicit, algorithmic in nature and is philosophically based on constructing certain 'Cantor sets of integers', whose 'gaps' correspond to blocks of zeros. We also prove that every non-decreasing submultiplicative function is asymptotically equivalent, up a linear error term, to the complexity function of a minimal subshift.

The Ammann A2 tiling is a simple aperiodically ordered tiling of the plane.

We present a closed-form formula for the average degree of the graph corresponding to this Ammann A2 tiling.

On the minimum strength of (unobserved) covariates to overturn an insignificant result
Danielle Tsao, Ronan Perry, Carlos Cinelli
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Applications (stat.AP)
We study conditions under which the addition of variables to a regression equation can turn a previously statistically insignificant result into a significant one. Specifically, we characterize the minimum strength of association required for these variables--both with the dependent and independent variables, or with the dependent variable alone--to elevate the observed t-statistic above a specified significance threshold. Interestingly, we show that it is considerably difficult to overturn a statistically insignificant result solely by reducing the standard error. Instead, included variables must also alter the point estimate to achieve such reversals in practice. Our results can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses against unobserved variables and to bound the maximum t-value one can obtain given different subsets of observed covariates, and may also offer algebraic explanations for patterns of reversals seen in empirical research, such as those documented by Lenz and Sahn (2021).

High-order finite element methods for three-dimensional multicomponent convection-diffusion
Aaron Baier-Reinio, Patrick E. Farrell
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We derive and analyze a broad class of finite element methods for numerically simulating the stationary, low Reynolds number flow of concentrated mixtures of several distinct chemical species in a common thermodynamic phase. The underlying partial differential equations that we discretize are the Stokes$\unicode{x2013}$Onsager$\unicode{x2013}$Stefan$\unicode{x2013}$Maxwell (SOSM) equations, which model bulk momentum transport and multicomponent diffusion within ideal and non-ideal mixtures. Unlike previous approaches, the methods are straightforward to implement in two and three spatial dimensions, and allow for high-order finite element spaces to be employed. The key idea in deriving the discretization is to suitably reformulate the SOSM equations in terms of the species mass fluxes and chemical potentials, and discretize these unknown fields using stable $H(\textrm{div}) \unicode{x2013} L^2$ finite element pairs. We prove that the methods are convergent and yield a symmetric linear system for a Picard linearization of the SOSM equations, which staggers the updates for concentrations and chemical potentials. We also discuss how the proposed approach can be extended to the Newton linearization of the SOSM equations, which requires the simultaneous solution of mole fractions, chemical potentials, and other variables. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments and we present an example of a physical application involving the microfluidic non-ideal mixing of hydrocarbons.

Let $\psi$ be a smooth compactly supported function on $\mathbb{X} = SL(2,\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathbb{H}$. In this paper, we are interested in the joint cubic moments of automorphic forms when the spectral parameters go to infinity. We show that the diagonal case for Eisenstein series $\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)E(z,1/2+it)^{3} d\mu z = \mathcal{O}_{\psi}(t^{-1/3+\varepsilon})$. In off-diagonal case we prove $\frac{1}{2\log t}\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)|E(z,1/2+it)|^{2}g(z)d\mu z = o(1)$ as long as $\min\{t , t_{g}\} \rightarrow \infty$. Finally we show
$\int_{\mathbb{X}}\psi(z)f^{2}(z)g(z)d\mu z = o(1)$ in the range $|t_{f} - t_{g}| \leq t_{f}^{2/3-\varepsilon}$ where $f,g$ are two Hecke-Maass cusp forms.

Stability criteria for rough systems
Luu Hoang Duc, Phan Thanh Hong, Nguyen Dinh Cong
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Probability (math.PR)
We propose a quantitative direct method to prove the local stability of a stationary solution for a rough differential equation and its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we provide stability criteria for a stationary solution of the continuous system to be exponentially stable, provided the diffusion term is bounded and its derivatives exhibit small growth. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with a sufficiently small step size, but one needs to apply the sewing lemma and stopping times for the discrete time set. Our stability criteria are based on the linearization of the drift and require only information about the bound and growth rates of the diffusion, making them data-driven criteria.

We show that when $n\gg k^{2}s$ and $p$ is not too small, with high probability, the maximum number of edges in a sub-hypergraph of $\mathcal{K}_p(n,k)$ with matching number $s$ is obtained by the trivial sub-hypergraphs, i.e. the sub-hypergraph consisting of all edges containing at least one vertex in a fixed set of $s$ vertices.

TASEP with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a general initial condition and a deterministically moving wall in front of the particles. Using colour-position symmetry, we express the one-point distributions in terms of particle positions in a TASEP with step initial condition along a space-like path.
Based on this formula, we analyse the large-time asymptotics of the model under various scenarios. For initial conditions other than the step initial condition, we identify a distinct asymptotic behaviour at the boundary of the region influenced by the wall, differing from the observations made in [Borodin-Bufetov-Ferrari'24] and [Ferrari-Gernholt'24]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that product limit distributions are associated with shocks in the macroscopic empirical density.
As a special case of our starting formula, we derive a variational expression for the one-point distributions of TASEP with arbitrary initial data. Focusing on non-random initial conditions, such as periodic ones with an arbitrary density, we leverage our analytical tools to characterise the limit distribution within the framework of particle positions.

Universal projection theorems with applications to multifractal analysis and the dimension of every ergodic measure on self-conformal sets simultaneously

Comments:
v3: the exposition in the introduction is revised. More details are added in the results on the multifractal analysis (Sections 3.4 and 8)
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
We prove a universal projection theorem, giving conditions on a parametrized family of maps $\Pi_\lambda : X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a collection M of measures on X under which for almost every $\lambda$ equality $\dim_H \Pi_\lambda \mu = \min\{d, \dim_H \mu\}$ holds for all measures $\mu \in M$ simultaneously (i.e. on a full measure set of $\lambda$'s independent of $\mu$). We require family $\Pi_\lambda$ to satisfy a transversality condition and collection M to satisfy a new condition called relative dimension separability. Under the same assumptions, we also prove that if the Assouad dimension of X is smaller than d, then for almost every $\lambda$, projection $\Pi_\lambda$ is nearly bi-Lipschitz (i.e. with pointwise $\alpha$-Hölder inverse for every $\alpha \in (0,1)$) at $\mu$-a.e. x, for all $\mu \in M$ simultaneously. Our setting encompasses families of orthogonal projections, natural projections corresponding to conformal iterated function systems, and non-autonomous or random IFS.
As applications, we provide novel results on the multifractal analysis, giving formula for the Hausdorff dimension of a level set of the local dimension for a typical (w.r.t the translation parameter) self-similar measure on the line, valid for the full range spectrum (including the decreasing part of the spectrum; previous results were covering only the increasing part).
Among another applications, we prove that given a parametrized contracting conformal IFS satisfying the transversality condition, for almost every parameter the dimension formula holds for all ergodic shift-invariant measures simultaneously. We also prove that the dimension part of the Marstrand's projection theorem holds simultaneously for the collection of all ergodic measures on a strongly separated self-conformal set and for the collection of all Gibbs measures on a self-conformal set (without any separation).

Spectrally accurate fully discrete schemes for some nonlocal and nonlinear integrable PDEs via explicit formulas

Subjects:

We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland DNLS, and cubic Szegő equations on the torus, which are $\textit{exact in time}$ with $\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral convergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ in $L^2$ norm for initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, $s>1$, with an error constant depending $\textit{linearly}$ on the final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on $\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the newly designed methods both at short and long time scales, thanks to the remarkable fact that the computational cost of the method is independent of the final time. These schemes open doors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.

Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds
Katarzyna Grabowska, Janusz Grabowski, Rouzbeh Mohseni
Comments:
35 pages, moderately revised and corrected
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a Kähler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous Kähler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous Kähler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.

Speeding up an unsteady flow simulation by adaptive BDDC and Krylov subspace recycling

Comments:
36 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We deal with accelerating the solution of a sequence of large linear systems solved by preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG). The sequence originates from time-stepping within a simulation of an unsteady incompressible flow. We apply a pressure correction scheme, and we focus on the solution of the Poisson problem for the pressure corrector. Its scalable solution presents the main computational challenge in many applications. The right-hand side of the problem changes in each time step, while the system matrix is constant and symmetric positive definite. The acceleration techniques are studied on a representative problem of flow around a unit sphere. Our baseline approach is based on a parallel solution of each problem in the sequence by nonoverlapping domain decomposition method. The interface problem is solved by PCG with the three-level BDDC preconditioner. As a preliminary step, an appropriate stopping criterion for the PCG iterations is chosen. Next, two techniques for accelerating the solution are gradually added to the baseline approach. Deflation is used within PCG with several approaches to Krylov subspace recycling. Finally, we add the adaptive selection of the coarse space within the three-level BDDC method. The paper is rich in experiments with careful measurements of computational times on a parallel supercomputer. The combination of the acceleration techniques eventually leads to saving more than 40% of the computational time.

Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings

Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.

On Min-Max Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control Considering Non-Unique Solutions to Behavioral Representation
Yibo Wang, Qingyuan Liu, Chao Shang
Comments:
16 pages
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Direct data-driven control methods are known to be vulnerable to uncertainty in stochastic systems. In this paper, we propose a new robust data-driven predictive control (DDPC) framework to tackle the uncertainty in dynamic systems. By analyzing non-unique solutions to behavioral representation, we first shed light on the lack of robustness in subspace predictive control (SPC) as well as the projection-based regularized DDPC. This inspires us to construct an uncertainty set that includes admissible output trajectories deviating to some extent from nominal predictions from the subspace predictor and develop a min-max robust formulation of DDPC that endows control sequences with robustness against such unknown deviations. We establish its performance guarantees under bounded additive noise and develop convex reformulations of the min-max problem. To mitigate the conservatism of robust design, a feedback robust DDPC scheme is further proposed by incorporating an affine feedback policy, with performance guarantees and tractable reformulations derived. Simulation studies show that the proposed method effectively robustifies SPC and outperforms projection-based regularizer.

This study focuses on optimizing species release $S_2$ to control species population $S_1$ through impulsive release strategies. We investigate the conditions required to remove species $S_1$, which is equivalent to the establishment of $S_2$. The research includes a theoretical analysis that examines the positivity, existence, and uniqueness of solutions, the conditions ensuring global stability, and a sufficient condition for controlling the $S_1$-free solution. In addition, we formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the effectiveness of $S_2$ releases, manage the population of $S_1$, and minimize the costs associated with this intervention strategy. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theories and allow visualization of population dynamics under various release scenarios.

We introduce the penalized Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator as a convergent method for estimating the number of nodes clusters when observing multiple networks within both multi-layer and dynamic Stochastic Block Models. We establish the consistency of the KT estimator, showing that it converges to the correct number of clusters in both types of models when the number of nodes in the networks increases. Our estimator does not require a known upper bound on this number to be consistent. Furthermore, we show that these consistency results hold in both dense and sparse regimes, making the penalized KT estimator robust across various network configurations. We illustrate its performance on synthetic datasets.

Error Bound Analysis for the Regularized Loss of Deep Linear Neural Networks

Comments:
33 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The optimization foundations of deep linear networks have recently received significant attention. However, due to their inherent non-convexity and hierarchical structure, analyzing the loss functions of deep linear networks remains a challenging task. In this work, we study the local geometric landscape of the regularized squared loss of deep linear networks around each critical point. Specifically, we derive a closed-form characterization of the critical point set and establish an error bound for the regularized loss under mild conditions on network width and regularization parameters. Notably, this error bound quantifies the distance from a point to the critical point set in terms of the current gradient norm, which can be used to derive linear convergence of first-order methods. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments and demonstrate that gradient descent converges linearly to a critical point when optimizing the regularized loss of deep linear networks.

Lyapunov-like Stability Inequality with an Asymmetric Matrix and Application to Suboptimal LQ Control Design
Avinash Kumar
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The Lyapunov inequality is an indispensable tool for stability analysis in linear control theory. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of an autonomous linear-time invariant system in terms of the existence of a symmetric positive-definite Lyapunov matrix. This work proposes a new variant of this inequality in which the constituent Lyapunov matrix is allowed to be asymmetric. After analysing the properties of the proposed inequality for a class of matrices, we derive new results for the stabilisation of linear systems. Subsequently, we utilize the developed results to obtain sufficient conditions for the suboptimal linear quadratic control design problem, where addition to having an asymmetric Lyapunov matrix, which serves as a design matrix for this problem, we provide a characterization of the cost associated with the computed stabilizing suboptimal control laws by deriving an expression for the upper bound on cost in terms of the initial conditions of the system. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed results using two numerical examples- one for suboptimal control design for a linear time-invariant system and another for the consensus (state-agreement) protocol design for a multi-agent system where-in we see how the asymmetry of the design matrix emerges as an inherent requirement for the problem.

We demonstrate that for finite cyclic structures, the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We further extend this result for finite abelian structures.

We study the ground-state properties of one-dimensional fluids of classical (i.e., non-quantum) particles interacting pairwisely via a potential, at the fixed particle density $\rho$. Restricting ourselves to periodic configurations of particles, two possibilities are considered: an equidistant chain of particles with the uniform spacing $A=1/\rho$ and its simplest non-Bravais modulation, namely a bipartite lattice composed of two equidistant chains, shifted with respect to one another. Assuming the long range of the interaction potential, the equidistant chain dominates if $A$ is small enough, $0<A<A_c$. At a critical value of $A=A_c$, the system undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition from the equidistant chain to a bipartite lattice. The energy and the order parameter are singular functions of the deviation from the critical point $A-A_c$ with universal (i.e., independent of the model's parameters) mean-field values of critical exponents. The tricritical point at which the curve of continuous second-order transitions meets with the one of discontinuous first-order transitions is determined. The general theory is applied to the Lennard-Jones model with the $(n,m)$ Mie potential for which the phase diagram is constructed. The inclusion of a hard-core around each particle reveals a non-universal critical phenomenon with an $m$-dependent critical exponent.

Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.

It is shown that a surface-link of ribbon surface-knot components is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it is a surface-link producing a ribbon surface-link by surgery along a self-trivial 1-handle system. This corrects an earlier statement. This result makes a corrected proof for the claim that every surface-link of trivial surface-knot components with at most one aspheric component is a ribbon surface-link. For non-ribbon surface-links of trivial components with at least two aspheric components constructed in a previous note, it adds the new property that non-ribbonability continues through surgery along any self-trivial 1-handle system.

This is under the assumption that the measurement operators and prediction functions are sufficiently smooth and their corresponding stochastic moments with respect to the prior distribution exist. Numerical experiments are presented to the illustrate the theoretical results.

Probability (math.PR)
We introduce and study derivatives in first-passage percolation with edge weights given by i.i.d. random variables supported on ${a,b}$. We show that the variance of the passage time can be expressed in terms of these derivatives. We further analyze their structure and establish several fundamental properties and bounds.

Almost sure bounds for higher-order derivatives of first-passage percolation with respect to the environment

Probability (math.PR)
The variance of the first-passage percolation is bounded by the $L^2$-norms of the derivatives with respect to the environment. In this paper we prove that the environment derivatives of orders $k\in\{2,3,4\}$ are bounded below by $-\binom{k-2}{\lceil\frac{k-2}2\rceil}$ and above by $\binom{k-2}{\lceil\frac{k-2}2\rceil}$. We believe that these are the bounds for all $k$. We provide examples of environments that show that these extreme values can be attained.

Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
In this work, we study the equivalence of various robustness properties of toric ideals of weighted oriented graphs. For any weighted oriented graph $D$, if its toric ideal $I_D$ is generalized robust (or weakly robust), then we show that $D$ does not have forbidden subgraphs $D_1,D_2$ of certain structures. We give a significant class of weighted oriented graphs $D$ whose toric ideals $I_D$ have the following equivalence.
(i) $I_{D}$ is strongly robust (equivalently, $I_{D}$ is robust);
(ii) $I_{D}$ is generalized robust (equivalently, $I_{D}$ is weakly robust);
(iii) $D$ does not have subgraphs equal to $D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$.

Probability (math.PR); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.

On exactness of SDP relaxation for the maximum cut problem
Avinash Bhardwaj, Hritiz Gogoi, Vishnu Narayanan, Abhishek Pathapati
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Semidefinite programming (SDP) provides a powerful relaxation of the maximum cut problem. For a graph $\mathcal{G}$ with rational weights, the decision problem of whether this relaxation is exact is known to be $NP$-complete since Delorme-Poljak (1993), but its complexity was unresolved for unweighted graphs. In this work, we extend the $NP$-completeness result for unweighted graphs. We then investigate and present a few classes of graphs, which we call exact graphs, for which the semidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem is exact. For each exact graph class, we determine the optimal objective value by explicitly constructing a maximum cut and then prove uniqueness of the exact solution for two of these classes. We complement these findings by showing that lexicographic products preserve exactness whenever the first factor is exact, with rank-$r$ solutions extending accordingly, and that a graph is exact if and only if when all of its splits are exact, with splitting also preserving the rank of optimal solutions. Addressing two open problems posed by Mirka and Williamson (2024), we demonstrate via counterexamples that exact semidefinite relaxations can admit higher-rank optimal solutions beyond the convex hull of rank-1 reference solutions. We then explain this phenomenon by proving the existence of rank-$(n-1)$ optimal solutions for particular classes of graphs. Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the corresponding solution to exact relaxation is unique for particular classes of complete graphs and complete $k$-partite graphs.

Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes of Graphs
Arka Ghosh, S Selvaraja
Comments:
25 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
This paper investigates the shellability of $r$-independence complexes $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$, a generalization of classical independence complexes introduced by Paolini and Salvetti. For a graph $G$, a subset $A \subseteq V(G)$ is $r$-independent if every connected component of the induced subgraph $G[A]$ has at most $r$ vertices. The associated simplicial complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ has been the subject of significant interest due to its connections to combinatorial topology and commutative algebra. We address the classification problem for shellable $r$-independence complexes, focusing on block graphs, trees, and related families. Our main results establish sufficient conditions for shellability based on structural graph parameters such as diameter and forbidden subgraphs. Furthermore, we develop constructive techniques for generating shellable complexes through graph operations, including star-clique attachments, clique whiskering, and clique cycle constructions. These results extend and refine earlier work on classical independence complexes and provide a framework for understanding the topological and algebraic properties of higher independence complexes in structured graph families.

Thermal boundary conditions in fractional superdiffusion of energy
Tomasz Komorowski, Stefano Olla
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study heat conduction in a one-dimensional finite,
unpinned chain of atoms perturbed by stochastic momentum exchange and coupled to Langevin
heat baths at possibly distinct temperatures placed at the
endpoints of the chain. While infinite systems without boundaries are known to exhibit
superdiffusive energy transport described by a fractional heat
equation with the generator $-|\Delta|^{3/4}$, the corresponding boundary conditions induced by heat baths
remain less understood. We establish the hydrodynamic limit for a finite chain with $n+1$
atoms connected to thermostats at the endpoints, deriving the macroscopic evolution of the averaged energy profile.
The limiting equation is governed by a non-local Lévy-type operator, with boundary terms determined by explicit interaction kernels
that encode absorption, reflection, and transmission of long-wavelength
phonons at the baths. Our results provide the first rigorous identification
of boundary conditions for fractional superdiffusion arising directly
from microscopic dynamics, highlighting their distinction from both diffusive and pinned-chain settings.

On the choice of optimization norm for Anderson acceleration of the Picard iteration for Navier-Stokes equations
Elizabeth Hawkins, Leo Rebholz
Comments:
21 pages, 9 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
While the most recent Anderson acceleration (AA) convergence theory [Pollock et al, {\it IMA Num. An.}, 2021] requires that the AA optimization norm match the Hilbert space norm associated with the fixed point operator, in implementations the $\ell^2$ norm is perhaps the most common choice. Unfortunately, so far there is little research done regarding this discrepancy which might reveal when it is fine to use $\ell^2$. To address this issue, we consider AA applied to the Picard iteration for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with varying choices of the AA optimization norm. We first prove a sharpened and generalized convergence estimate for depth $m$ AA-Picard for the NSE with the $H^1_0$ AA optimization norm by using a problem-specific analysis, utilizing a sharper treatment of the nonlinear terms than previous AA-Picard convergence studies, removing a small data assumption, and developing new AA term identities in the NSE nonlinear term estimates. Next, we prove a convergence result for when $L^2$ is used as the AA optimization norm, and this estimate is found to be very similar to that of the $H^1_0$ case. While no analogous theory seems possible for the $\ell^2$ norm, several numerical tests were run to compare AA-Picard convergence with varying choices of AA optimization norm. These tests revealed that convergence behavior was always similar for $L^2$ and $H^1_0$ and {\it usually but not always} similar for $\ell^2$: on a test problem for channel flow past a cylinder with coarser meshes, convergence of AA-Picard using $\ell^2$ performs significantly worse than using $L^2$ and $H^1_0$.

Strong edge-coloring of graphs with maximum edge weight seven
Runze Wang
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A strong edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is an edge-coloring such that any two edges of distance at most two receive distinct colors. The minimum number of colors we need in order to give $G$ a strong edge-coloring is called the strong chromatic index of $G$, denoted by $\chi_s'(G)$. The maximum edge weight of $G$ is defined to be $\max\{d(u)+d(v):\ uv\in E(G)\}$. In this paper, using the discharging method, we prove that if $G$ is a graph with maximum edge weight $7$ and maximum average degree less than $\frac{40}{13}$, then $\chi_s'(G)\le 13$. Also, we determine the largest possible maximum average degree of a graph with given maximum edge weight.

Missing faces of neighborly and nearly neighborly polytopes and spheres

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For a $(d-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex $\Delta$ and $1\leq i\leq d$, let $f_{i-1}$ be the number of $(i-1)$-faces of $\Delta$ and $m_i$ be the number of missing $i$-faces of $\Delta$. In the nineties, Kalai asked for a characterization of the $m$-numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres -- a problem that remains wide open to this day. Here, we study the $m$-numbers of nearly neighborly and neighborly polytopes and spheres. Specifically, for $d\geq 4$, we obtain a lower bound on $m_{\lfloor d/2\rfloor}$ in terms of $f_0$ and $f_{\lfloor d/2\rfloor-1}$ in the class of all $(\lfloor d/2\rfloor-1)$-neighborly $(d-1)$-spheres. For neighborly spheres, we (almost) characterize the $m$-numbers of $2$-neighborly $4$-spheres, and we show that, for all odd values of $k$, there exists an infinite family of neighborly simplicial $2k$-spheres with $m_{k+1}=0$. Along the way, we provide a simple numerical condition based on the $m$-numbers that allows to establish non-polytopality of some neighborly odd-dimensional spheres.

A scaling and recovering algorithm for the matrix $φ$-functions
Awad H. Al-Mohy, Xiaobo Liu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
A new scaling and recovering algorithm is proposed for simultaneously computing the matrix $\varphi$-functions that arise in exponential integrator methods for the numerical solution of certain first-order systems of ordinary differential equations. The algorithm initially scales the input matrix down by a nonnegative integer power of two, and then evaluates the $[m/m]$ diagonal Padé approximant to $\varphi_p$, where $p$ is the largest index of interest. The remaining $[m+p{-}j/m]$ Padé approximants to $\varphi_j$, $0 \le j < p$, are obtained implicitly via a recurrence relation. The effect of scaling is subsequently recovered using the double-argument formula. A rigorous backward error analysis, based on the $[m+p/m]$ Padé approximant to the exponential, enables sharp bounds on the relative backward errors. These bounds are expressed in terms of the sequence $\|A^k\|^{1/k}$, which can be much smaller than $\|A\|$ for nonnormal matrices. The scaling parameter and the degrees of the Padé approximants are selected to minimize the overall computational cost, which benefits from the sharp bounds and the optimal evaluation schemes for diagonal Padé approximants. Furthermore, if the input matrix is (quasi-)triangular, the algorithm exploits its structure in the recovering phase. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing alternatives in both accuracy and efficiency.

A Categorical Perspective on Braid Representations

Comments:
44 pages. Presentation improved and some additional content added
Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Category Theory (math.CT); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, i.e. strict monoidal functors $F\colon B\rightarrow Mat$ from the braid category $B$ to the category of matrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the (constant) Yang-Baxter equation. A major part of the contribution here is to introduce, compare, and contrast suitable notions of isomorphism of representations. A significant contribution here is an extensive range of key examples and counterexamples.
Our approach is mainly motivated by the recent classification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which the target $Mat$ is replaced by the subcategory $Match^N$. One objective is to understand from the categorical perspective how the classification was facilitated by this change (with the aim of generalising). Progress is made here by observing that the category of functors $MonFun(B,Mat)$ is itself a monoidal category (Theorem 5.3). In addition, we introduce the notion of sub and quotient objects, proving that an object that is both sub and quotient corresponds to an endomorphism in $MonFun(B,Mat)$ (Theorem 5.18). We also observe that objects with target $Match^N$ always have sub and quotient objects. This monoidal category leads us to consider monoidal subcategories whose objects share a given property, giving rise to a new way to see how group-type and involutive solutions, for example, fit into our framework.
Another objective is to understand how universal such a restricted target is. Here we give various properties exposing the implications of different choices of equivalence and describe some relationships among them (Theorem 7.18, Theorem 7.9, Conj. 7.19, Conj. 7.22).
A key result of this paper is Th.2.9, which shows that, in a `sufficiently free' setting including our case, every monoidal functor is equivalent to a strict one.

SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow-ups
D.Kinzebulatov, R.Vafadar
Comments:
Fixed typos, some minor changes in the presentation
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.

We consider various function space of analytic functions of several variables in various domains in $C^n$ and provide or complete descriptions of traces or estimates of traces of various analytic function spaces in various domains obtained in recent years, by various authors. The problem to find sharp estimates of Hardy analytic function spaces in the unit polydisk first was posed by W. Rudin. Since then many papers appeared in literature. We collect in this expository paper not only already many known results on traces of various analytic function spaces in product domains but also discuss various new interesting results related with this problem. Related to trace problem various results were provided previously by G. Henkin, E. Amar, H. Alexander and various other authors. Finally note that our trace theorems are closely related with the Bergman type projections acting between function spaces with different dimensions.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.

Robust Energy-Efficient DRL-Based Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS Systems with Jitter

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient design for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication system with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) and UAV jitter. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the 53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL baselines.

On the Linear Speedup of the Push-Pull Method for Decentralized Optimization over Digraphs
Liyuan Liang, Gan Luo, Kun Yuan
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The linear speedup property is essential for demonstrating the advantage of distributed algorithms over their single-node counterparts. In this paper, we study the stochastic Push-Pull method, a widely adopted decentralized optimization algorithm over directed graphs (digraphs). Unlike methods that rely solely on row-stochastic or column-stochastic mixing matrices, Push-Pull avoids nonlinear correction and has shown superior empirical performance across a variety of settings. However, its theoretical analysis remains challenging, and the linear speedup property has not been generally establishe--revealing a significant gap between empirical success and limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis framework and prove that Push-Pull achieves linear speedup over arbitrary strongly connected digraphs. Our results provide the comprehensive theoretical understanding for stochastic Push-Pull, aligning its theory with empirical performance. Code: this https URL.

Bousfield-Kan completion as a codensity $\infty$-monad

Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
Working in the setting of $\infty$-categories, we develop a general theory of the codensity monad $T_\mathcal{D}$ associated with a full subcategory $\mathcal{D}\subseteq \mathcal{C}$. We show that $T_\mathcal{D}$ has a canonical monad structure (unique up to a contractible space of choices), and characterize it as a terminal monad preserving all objects of $\mathcal{D}$. For a monad $\mathcal{M}$ on an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we consider the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor defined as the totalization of the cosimplicial resolution associated with $\mathcal{M}$. We show that the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor is the codensity monad associated with the full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ spanned by objects that admit a structure of $\mathcal{M}$-algebra. In particular, the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor is the terminal monad preserving all objects that admit a structure of an $\mathcal{M}$-algebra. This gives a full $\infty$-categorical characterization of the classical Bousfield-Kan $R$-completion functor as the terminal monad on the category of spaces preserving the empty space and all products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $K(A,n)$, where $A$ is an $R$-module.

This is the first result that allows for nonnegative density driven by a low-regularity initial velocity, while also remaining valid in the presence of a small viscosity jump.

Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices
Cyriac Antony, Jacob Antony, Jinitha Varughese, Bloomy Joseph
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
Oriented line graph, introduced by Kotani and Sunada (2000), is closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix (1989). It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomials of the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the skew-symmetric adjacency matrix (and Hermitian adjacency matrix) of $\vec{L}(G)$ for $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d\geq 3$.
A locally bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is a mapping $\psi\colon V(G)\to V(H)$ such that for every vertex $v$ of $G$, the restriction of $\psi$ to the neighborhood $N_G(v)$ is a bijection (resp. injection) from $N_G(v)$ to $N_H(\psi(v))$ (Fiala and Kratochvíl, 2008). An out-neighborhood bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a directed graph $\vec{G}$ to a directed graph $\vec{H}$ is a mapping $\psi\colon V(\vec{G})\to V(\vec{H})$ such that for every vertex $v$ of $\vec{G}$, the restriction of $\psi$ to the out-neighborhood $N_{\vec{G}}^+(v)$ is a bijection (resp. injection) from $N_{\vec{G}}^+(v)$ to $N_{\vec{H}}^+(\psi(v))$ (Antony and Shalu, 2025). We prove that the existence of a locally bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from a graph $G$ of minimum degree at least 3 to a graph $H$ is equivalent to the existence of an out-neighborhood bijective (resp. injective) homomorphism from $\vec{L}(G)$ to $\vec{L}(H)$. We also prove some results on the coloring variants distance-two coloring and star coloring.

cuPDLPx: A Further Enhanced GPU-Based First-Order Solver for Linear Programming
Haihao Lu, Zedong Peng, Jinwen Yang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We introduce cuPDLPx, a further enhanced GPU-based first-order solver for linear programming. Building on the recently developed restarted Halpern PDHG for LP, cuPDLPx incorporates a number of new techniques, including a new restart criterion and a PID-controlled primal weight update. These improvements are carefully tailored for GPU architectures and deliver substantial computational gains. Across benchmark datasets, cuPDLPx achieves 2.5x-5x speedups on MIPLIB LP relaxations and 3x-6.8x on Mittelmann's benchmark set, with particularly strong improvements in high-accuracy and presolve-enabled settings. The solver is publicly available at this https URL.

Explicit Monotone Stable Super-Time-Stepping Methods for Finite Time Singularities
Zheng Tan, Tariq D. Aslam, Andrea L. Bertozzi
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We explore a novel way to numerically resolve the scaling behavior of finite-time singularities in solutions of nonlinear parabolic PDEs. The Runge--Kutta--Legendre (RKL) and Runge--Kutta--Gegenbauer (RKG) super-time-stepping methods were originally developed for nonlinear complex physics problems with diffusion. These are multi-stage single step second-order, forward-in-time methods with no implicit solves. The advantage is that the timestep size for stability scales with stage number $s$ as $\mathcal{O}(s^2)$. Many interesting nonlinear PDEs have finite-time singularities, and the presence of diffusion often limits one to using implicit or semi-implicit timestep methods for stability constraints. Finite-time singularities are particularly challenging due to the large range of scales that one desires to resolve, often with adaptive spatial grids and adaptive timesteps. Here we show two examples of nonlinear PDEs for which the self-similar singularity structure has time and space scales that are resolvable using the RKL and RKG methods, without forcing even smaller timesteps. Compared to commonly-used implicit numerical methods, we achieve significantly smaller run time while maintaining comparable accuracy. We also prove numerical monotonicity for both the RKL and RKG methods under their linear stability conditions for the constant coefficient heat equation, in the case of infinite domain and periodic boundary condition, leading to a theoretical guarantee of the superiority of the RKL and RKG methods over traditional super-time-stepping methods, such as the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and the orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (ROCK) methods.

It is shown that a boundary surface-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon surface-link if the surface-link obtained from it by surgery along a pairwise nontrivial fusion 1-handle system is a ribbon surface-link. As a corollary, the surface-knot obtained from the anti-parallel surface-link of a non-ribbon surface-knot by surgery along a nontrivial fusion 1-handleis a non-ribbon surface-knot. This result answers Cochran's conjecture on non-ribbon sphere-knots in the affirmative.

Quantitative gap universality for Wigner matrices
Albert Zhang
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We obtain the explicit rate of convergence $N^{-1/2 + \epsilon}$ for the gaps of generalized Wigner matrices in the bulk of the spectrum, for distributions of matrix entries possibly atomic and supported on enough points. The proof proceeds by a Green function comparison, coupled with the relaxation estimate from [5]. In particular, we extend the 4 moment matching method [33] to arbitrary moments, allowing to compare resolvents down to the submicroscopic scale $N^{-3/2 + \epsilon}$. This method also gives universality of the smallest gaps between eigenvalues for the Hermitian symmetry class, providing a universal, optimal separation of eigenvalues for discrete random matrices with entries supported on $\Omega(1)$ points.

On admissibility in post-hoc hypothesis testing
Ben Chugg, Tyron Lardy, Aaditya Ramdas, Peter Grünwald
Comments:
56 pages
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
The validity of classical hypothesis testing requires the significance level $\alpha$ be fixed before any statistical analysis takes place. This is a stringent requirement. For instance, it prohibits updating $\alpha$ during (or after) an experiment due to changing concern about the cost of false positives, or to reflect unexpectedly strong evidence against the null. Perhaps most disturbingly, witnessing a p-value $p\ll\alpha$ vs $p= \alpha- \epsilon$ for tiny $\epsilon > 0$ has no (statistical) relevance for any downstream decision-making. Following recent work of Grünwald (2024), we develop a theory of post-hoc hypothesis testing, enabling $\alpha$ to be chosen after seeing and analyzing the data. To study "good" post-hoc tests we introduce $\Gamma$-admissibility, where $\Gamma$ is a set of adversaries which map the data to a significance level. We classify the set of $\Gamma$-admissible rules for various sets $\Gamma$, showing they must be based on e-values, and recover the Neyman-Pearson lemma when $\Gamma$ is the constant map. We also give a Rao-Blackwellization result, proving that the expected utility of an e-value can be improved (for any concave utility) by conditioning on a sufficient statistic.

A closed formula for the Geil-Matsumoto bound on semigroups and curves with many points
Adler Marques, Erik Mendoza, Luciane Quoos, Guilherme Tizziotti
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
The Geil-Matsumoto bound (GM bound) constrains the number of rational points on a curve over a finite field in terms of the Weierstrass semigroup of any of the points on the curve. For general numerical semigroups, the GM bound lacks a simple closed-form expression, making its computation a challenging problem. A closed formula has been obtained for the case when the semigroup is generated by two co-prime integers. In this work, for any numerical semigroup, we provide a closed formula for the GM bound in terms of the Apéry set of a nonzero element of the semigroup. In the case where the numerical semigroup is generated by consecutive integers $n, n+1, \dots, n+t$ with $\lceil\textstyle\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil\leq t \leq n-1$, we obtain a simple closed formula for the bound. We apply these results to obtain upper bounds on the number of rational points for algebraic curves over finite fields. In some cases, the GM bound improves some well-known upper bounds on the number of rational points.

Convergence of the adaptive finite element discretization based parallel orbital-updating method for eigenvalue problems

It is significant and challenging to solve eigenvalue problems of partial differential operators when many highly accurate eigenpair approximations are required. The adaptive finite element discretization based parallel orbital-updating method, which can significantly reduce the computational cost and enhance the parallel scalability, has been shown to be efficient in electronic structure calculations. However, there is no any mathematical justification for this method in literature. In this paper, we will show the convergence of the method for clustered eigenvalue problems of linear partial differential operators.

Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants

Comments:
48 pages, 1 figure, v2: references added
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.

Spectrum and local weak convergence of sparse random uniform hypergraphs
Kartick Adhikari, Samiron Parui
Comments:
44 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
The notion of local weak convergence, or Benjamini--Schramm convergence, was introduced by Benjamini and Schramm. The local weak limit of sparse Erd\H os--Rényi graphs is the Galton--Watson measure with Poisson offspring almost surely. Recently, Adhikari, Kumar, and Saha showed that the line graph of sparse Linial--Meshulam complexes converges to the $d$-block Galton--Watson measure. We study a unified model: weighted line graphs of sparse $k$-uniform random hypergraphs on $n$ vertices. Let $H(n,k,p)$ be the $k$-uniform random hypergraph where each $k$-subset of $[n]$ is included as a hyperedge independently with probability $p$. For a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ and $1\le r\le k-1$, define the $r$-set weighted line graph $G_r(H)=(\mathcal V_r,\mathcal E_r,w_H)$ by $$ \mathcal V_r=\bigl[\tbinom{n}{r}\bigr],\quad \mathcal E_r=\bigl\{\{\tau_1,\tau_2\}:\tau_1,\tau_2\in\mathcal V_r,\ \exists e\in E\text{ s.t. }\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\bigr\}, $$ with weight $w_H(\{\tau_1,\tau_2\})=\bigl|\{e\in E:\tau_1,\tau_2\subset e\}\bigr|$. In particular, $G_1(H_n)$ generalizes Erd\H os--Rényi graphs and $G_{k-1}(H_n)$ is the line graph of the Linial--Meshulam complex. We show that if $\tbinom{n-r}{k-r}\to \lambda$ as $n\to\infty$, then $G_r(H_n)$ converges locally to the $(\tbinom{k}{r}-1)$-block Galton--Watson measure with $\operatorname{Poisson}(\lambda)$ offspring almost surely. As a consequence, we obtain the limiting spectral distribution of the adjacency matrices of $G_r(H_n)$.

We formulated a homological and computer-aided approach to study certain unions of symplectic surfaces, called symplectic configurations, in a rational $4$-manifold $X=CP^2\# N\overline{CP^2}$. We addressed several fundamental theoretical questions, and also as a technical device, developed a symplectic analog of the so-called quadratic Cremona transformations in complex algebraic geometry. As an application, we gave a new proof that a certain line arrangement in $CP^2$, called Fano planes, does not exist in the symplectic category. The nonexistence of Fano planes in the holomorphic category was due to Hirzebruch, and in the topological category, it was first proved by Ruberman and Starkston. Our proof in the symplectic category is independent to both.

We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary hypersurfaces with a general contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside arbitrary convex sets. We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex set is larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, and we characterize the equality cases. This provides a complete solution to the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces outside convex sets at arbitrary contact angles, generalizing the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritoré inequality, which corresponds to the case $\theta=\frac\pi2$.

Persistence probabilities for fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise
G. Molchan
Comments:
24 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The main objective of this study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a>0 is the multiplicity(not necessarily an integer) of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit positive level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H>1,0<H<1) ). We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing 'a' and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.

The objective of this article is to prove the necessity statement in Crawley-Boevey's conjectural solution to the (tame) Deligne-Simpson problem. We use the nonabelian Hodge correspondence, variation of parabolic weights and results of Schedler-Tirelli to reduce to simpler situations, where every conjugacy class is semi-simple and the underlying quiver is (1) an affine Dynkin diagram or (2) an affine Dynkin diagram with an extra vertex. In case (1), a nonexistence result of Kostov applies. In case (2), the key step is to show that simple representations, if exist, lie in the same connected component as direct sums of lower dimensional ones.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We analyze a zeroth-order particle algorithm for the global optimization of a non-convex function, focusing on a variant of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) with small but fixed noise intensity. Unlike most previous studies restricted to finite horizons, we investigate its long-time behavior with fixed parameters. In the mean-field limit, a quantitative Laplace principle shows exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the minimizer x * . For finitely many particles, a block-wise analysis yields explicit error bounds: individual particles achieve long-time consistency near x * , and the global best particle converge to x * . The proof technique combines a quantitative Laplace principle with block-wise control of Wasserstein distances, avoiding the exponential blow-up typical of Gr{ö}nwall-based estimates.

In this paper, we prove that the large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model is given by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) in both finite and infinite volumes. We establish uniform in $N$ bounds for the dynamics, which enable us to demonstrate convergence to the mean-field SDE with polynomial interactions. Furthermore, the mean-field SDE is shown to be globally well-posed for suitable initial distributions. We also prove the existence of stationary measures for the mean-field SDE. For small inverse temperatures, we characterize the large $N$ limit of the spin $O(N)$ model through stationary coupling. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of the stationary measure for the mean-field SDE.

Numerical solution of the unsteady Brinkman equations in the framework of $H$(div)-conforming finite element methods
Costanza Aricò, Rainer Helmig, Ivan Yotov
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present projection-based mixed finite element methods for the solution of the unsteady Brinkman equations for incompressible single-phase flow with fixed in space porous solid inclusions. At each time step the method requires the solution of a predictor and a projection problem. The predictor problem, which uses a stress-velocity mixed formulation, accounts for the momentum balance, while the projection problem, which is based on a velocity-pressure mixed formulation, accounts for the incompressibility. The spatial discretization is $H$(div)-conforming and the velocity computed at the end of each time step is pointwise divergence-free. Unconditional stability of the fully-discrete scheme and first order in time accuracy are established. Due to the $H$(div)-conformity of the formulation, the methods are robust in both the Stokes and the Darcy regimes. In the specific code implementation, we discretize the computational domain using the Raviart--Thomas space $RT_1$ in two and three dimensions, applying a second-order accurate multipoint flux mixed finite element scheme with a quadrature rule that samples the flux degrees of freedom. In the predictor problem this allows for a local elimination of the viscous stress and results in element-based symmetric and positive definite systems for each velocity component with $\left(d+1\right)$ degrees of freedom per simplex (where $d$ is the dimension of the problem). In a similar way, we locally eliminate the corrected velocity in the projection problem and solve an element-based system for the pressure. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the convergence of the proposed scheme and illustrate its performance for several challenging applications, including one-domain modeling of coupled free fluid and porous media flows and heterogeneous porous media with strong discontinuity of the porosity and permeability values.

Nonmonotone Trust-Region Methods for Optimization of Set-Valued Mapping of Finite Cardinality
Suprova Ghosh, Debdas Ghosh, Zai-Yun Peng, Xian-Jun Long
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Non-monotone trust-region methods are known to provide additional benefits for scalar and multi-objective optimization, such as enhancing the probability of convergence and improving the speed of convergence. For optimization of set-valued maps, non-monotone trust-region methods have not yet been explored and investigated to see if they show similar benefits. Thus, in this article, we propose two non-monotone trust-region schemes--max-type and average-type for set-valued optimization. Using these methods, the aim is to find \emph{K}-critical points for a non-convex unconstrained set optimization problem through vectorization and oriented-distance scalarization. The main modification in the existing trust region method for set optimization occurs in reduction ratios, where max-type uses the maximum over function values from the last few iterations, and avg-type uses an exponentially weighted moving average of successive previous function values till the current iteration. Under appropriate assumptions, we show the global convergence of the proposed methods. To verify their effectiveness, we numerically compare their performance with the existing trust region method, steepest descent method, and conjugate gradient method using performance profile in terms of three metrics: number of non-convergence, number of iterations, and computation time.

Comments:

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We establish a general analytic and geometric framework for resolving Spin(7)--orbifolds. These spaces arise naturally as boundary points in the moduli space of exceptional holonomy metrics, and smooth Gromov--Hausdorff resolutions can be viewed as paths from the boundary to the interior of the moduli space. Our construction combines algebraic and symplectic techniques with analytic gluing methods: singular strata are replaced by families of adiabatic torsion--free, asymptotically conical fibred spaces whose existence is controlled by the analysis of Dirac--type operators on orbifold resolutions. We formulate obstruction conditions in terms of string cohomology, prove existence results for torsion--free Spin(7)--structures extending Joyce's theorem arXiv:math/9910002 to the setting of orbifold resolutions, and construct new families of compact Spin(7)--manifolds. By dimensional reduction, our results also recover, generalise and extend the results of Joyce and Karigiannis arXiv:1707.09325 on $G_2$--orbifold resolutions. This unifies and extends all known resolution methods for exceptional holonomy orbifolds.

Fighting fish is a combinatorial configuration introduced by Duchi et al. as a new model of branching surfaces that generalizes directed convex polyominoes. We come up with an alternative construction of fighting fish, using a tree structure built on the so-called stem cells of fighting fish. From this perspective, we establish a bijection between ternary trees and fighting fish with a marked strip of cells, which specializes to a direct bijection between left ternary trees and fighting fish. Using these results, we obtain a combinatorial enumeration of the fighting fish of size $n$ by establishing a $(n+1)$-to-2 bijection with the ternary trees having $n$ nodes. We present some additional enumerative results including that the fighting fish with a marked tail and the horizontally symmetric fighting fish are equinumerous with the ordered pairs of ternary trees having a total of a prescribed number of nodes.

In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.

Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere
Mingyang Han, Chunqin Zhou
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.

Small solutions of ternary quadratic congruences with averaging over the moduli

In a recent paper, we proved that for any large enough odd modulus $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and fixed $\alpha_2\in \mathbb{N}$ coprime to $q$, the congruence \[ x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q} \] has a solution of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $x_3$ coprime to $q$ of height $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ for, in a sense, almost all $\alpha_3$, where $\alpha_3$ runs over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$. Here it was of significance that $11/24<1/2$, so we broke a natural barrier. In this paper, we average the moduli $q$ in addition, establishing the existence of a solution of height $\le Q^{3/8+\varepsilon}\alpha_2^{\varepsilon}$ for almost all pairs $(q,\alpha_3)$, with $Q$ large enough, $Q<q\le 2Q$, $q$ coprime to $2\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ running over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$.

In this paper we investigate the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals $I \subset S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ generated in degree $n-2$, where $K$ is a field. Every such ideal arises as the complementary edge ideal $I_c(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the defining equations of the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ in terms of the combinatorics of $G$. If $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph whose unique induced cycle has length $3$ or $4$, we prove that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is Koszul. We also determine the asymptotic depth of the powers of $I_c(G)$, proving that $\lim_{k \to \infty}\text{depth}\, S/I_c(G)^k=b(G)$, where $b(G)$ is the number of bipartite connected components of $G$. Finally, we show that the index of depth stability of $I_c(G)$ is at most $n-2$, and equality holds when $G$ is a path graph.

In the literature on nonlinear cointegration, a long-standing open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression, which provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a vector of time series, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the profound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR), which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem to a nonlinearly cointegrated setting, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated, censored and kinked Brownian motions, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters.

In 1981, Schoen-Yau and Witten showed that in General Relativity both the total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modeling an isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if $m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case. As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.

Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system

Subjects:

We show that the statistics of a chaotic system can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators and computing their densities of states. For such operators, the density of states is well understood and can be computed straightforwardly, often yielding explicit formulas. As a case study, we investigate a nonlinear recursion relation that maps naturally onto a family of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This correspondence enables us to derive an explicit formula for the limiting statistics of the chaotic system and to demonstrate that the clustering near to critical values is equivalent to the van Hove singularities in the operators' densities of states.

When applying nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), the rank parameter is generally unknown. This rank, called the nonnegative rank, is usually estimated heuristically since computing its exact value is NP-hard. In this work, we propose an approximation method to estimate the rank on-the-fly while solving NMF. We use the sum-of-norm (SON), a group-lasso structure that encourages pairwise sim- ilarity, to reduce the rank of a factor matrix when the initial rank is overestimated. On various datasets, SON-NMF can reveal the correct nonnegative rank of the data without prior knowledge or parameter tuning. SON-NMF is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, non-separable, and non-proximable problem, making it nontrivial to solve. First, since rank estimation in NMF is NP-hard, the proposed approach does not benefit from lower computational com- plexity. Using a graph-theoretic argument, we prove that the complexity of SON- NMF is essentially irreducible. Second, the per-iteration cost of algorithms for SON-NMF can be high. This motivates us to propose a first-order BCD algorithm that approximately solves SON-NMF with low per-iteration cost via the proximal average operator. SON-NMF exhibits favorable features for applications. Besides the ability to automatically estimate the rank from data, SON-NMF can handle rank-deficient data matrices and detect weak components with small energy. Furthermore, in hyperspectral imaging, SON-NMF naturally addresses the issue of spectral variability.

This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.

Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for learning communities in time-evolving networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We consider the supra-Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the supra-Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.

Operator Splitting Covariance Steering for Safe Stochastic Nonlinear Control

Subjects:
Robotics (cs.RO); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving distribution steering problems featuring nonlinear dynamics and chance constraints. Covariance steering (CS) is an emerging methodology in stochastic optimal control that poses constraints on the first two moments of the state distribution -- thereby being more tractable than full distributional control. Nevertheless, a significant limitation of current approaches for solving nonlinear CS problems, such as sequential convex programming (SCP), is that they often generate infeasible or poor results due to the large number of constraints. In this paper, we address these challenges, by proposing an operator splitting CS approach that temporarily decouples the full problem into subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This relaxation does not require intermediate iterates to satisfy all constraints simultaneously prior to convergence, which enhances exploration and improves feasibility in such non-convex settings. Simulation results across a variety of robotics applications verify the ability of the proposed method to find better solutions even under stricter safety constraints than standard SCP. Finally, the applicability of our framework on real systems is also confirmed through hardware demonstrations

This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor-Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.

Homophily -- the tendency of individuals to interact with similar others -- shapes how networks form and function. Yet existing approaches typically collapse homophily to a single scale, either one parameter for the whole network or one per community, thereby detaching it from other structural features. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy random graph model that moves beyond these limits, capturing homophily across all social scales in the network, with parameters for each group size. The framework decomposes homophily into within- and across-group contributions, recovering the stochastic block model as a special case. As an exponential-family model, it fits empirical data and enables inference of group-level variation of homophily that aggregate metrics miss. The group-dependence of homophily substantially impacts network percolation thresholds, altering predictions for epidemic spread, information diffusion, and the effectiveness of interventions. Ignoring such heterogeneity risks systematically misjudging connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.

We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. Under certain physically reasonable assumptions that ensure the existence of such ensembles, we derive two generic characteristics of the leading curvature corrections: (1) they are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and (2) their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We also obtain exact analytical results for microcanonical ensembles in de Sitter spacetime, which reproduce the perturbative results in the limit $\Lambda \to 0$, but have interesting limits when the size of the system is comparable to ${\Lambda}^{-1/2}$. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry, and illustrate this by comparing and contrasting the results for (i) geodesic box in de Sitter, (ii) geodesic box in Schwarzschild, and (iii) uniformly accelerated box in Minkowski. Finally, we extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.

Saturation-Aware Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithm

Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses coded masks to compress a 3D data cube into a single 2D snapshot. In practice, multiplexing can push intensities beyond the sensor's dynamic range, producing saturation that violates the linear SCI model and degrades reconstruction. This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of SCI recovery under saturation. We model clipping as an element-wise nonlinearity and derive a finite-sample recovery bound for compression-based SCI that links reconstruction error to mask density and the extent of saturation. The analysis yields a clear design rule: optimal Bernoulli masks use densities below one-half, decreasing further as saturation strengthens. Guided by this principle, we optimize mask patterns and introduce a novel reconstruction framework, Saturation-Aware PnP Net (SAPnet), which explicitly enforces consistency with saturated measurements. Experiments on standard video-SCI benchmarks confirm our theory and demonstrate that SAPnet significantly outperforms existing PnP-based methods.

Comparison of lubrication theory and Stokes flow models in step bearings with flow separation

The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large gradients in the surface geometry. We present an analytic solution to the Reynolds equation in a piecewise-linear domain alongside a more general finite difference solution. For the Stokes equations, we use a finite difference solution for the biharmonic stream-velocity formulation. We compare the fluid velocity, pressure, and resistance for various step bearing geometries in the lubrication and Stokes limits. We find that the solutions to the Reynolds equation do not capture flow separation resulting from large cross-film pressure gradients. Flow separation and corner flow recirculation in step bearings are explored further; we consider the effect of smoothing large gradients in the surface geometry in order to recover limits under which the lubrication and Stokes approximations converge.

We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-König bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.

Universal fault-tolerant quantum computation requires overcoming the Eastin--Knill theorem on quantum error correction (QEC) codes that protect information from noise. This is often accomplished through strategies like magic state distillation, which prepares computational resources -- namely, magic states -- whose power is rooted in quantum contextuality, a fundamental nonclassical feature generalizing Bell nonlocality. Yet, the broader role of contextuality in enabling universality, including its significance as an inherent feature of QEC codes and protocols themselves, has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a rigorous framework for contextuality in QEC and prove three main results. Fundamentally, we show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual in their partial closure, while others are noncontextual, establishing a clear criterion for identifying contextual codes. Mathematically, we unify Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic and Kirby--Love's tree-based definitions of contextuality, resolving a conjecture of Kim and Abramsky. Practically, we prove that many widely studied code-switching protocols which admit universal transversal gate sets, such as the doubled color codes introduced by Bravyi and Cross, are necessarily strongly contextual in their partial closure. Collectively, our results establish quantum contextuality as an intrinsic characteristic of fault-tolerant quantum codes and protocols, complementing entanglement and magic as resources for scalable quantum computation. For quantum coding theorists, this provides a new invariant: contextuality classifies which subsystem stabilizer codes can participate in universal fault-tolerant protocols. These findings position contextuality not only as a foundational concept but also as a practical guide for the design and analysis of future QEC architectures.

Robust DNN Partitioning and Resource Allocation Under Uncertain Inference Time

Subjects:
Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.

An Algebraic Extension of Intuitionistic Linear Logic: The $L_!^S$-Calculus and Its Categorical Model

Comments:

Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO); Category Theory (math.CT)
We introduce the $L_!^S$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with scalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL). These algebraic operations enable the direct expression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically available in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we develop the $L_!^S$-calculus as an extension of the $L^S$-calculus with the $!$ modality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties--subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation, and an introduction property--as well as preserve the expressiveness of the original $L^S$-calculus, including the encoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms and linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of linear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation of the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a measurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.

Dynamical Low-Rank Compression of Neural Networks with Robustness under Adversarial Attacks

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing accuracy on clean data. The method is model- and data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.

Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space Meta-Bandits

We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Title:
A dichotomy law for certain classes of phylogenetic networks
Michael Fuchs, Mike Steel
Comments:
15 pages, 3 figures

Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Many classes of phylogenetic networks have been proposed in the literature. A feature of several of these classes is that if one restricts a network in the class to a subset of its leaves, then the resulting network may no longer lie within this class. This has implications for their biological applicability, since some species -- which are the leaves of an underlying evolutionary network -- may be missing (e.g., they may have become extinct, or there are no data available for them) or we may simply wish to focus attention on a subset of the species. On the other hand, certain classes of networks are `closed' when we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all phylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled networks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks that have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the number of reticulations, height, etc.) bounded by some fixed value. It is easily shown that a closed subclass of phylogenetic trees is either all trees or a vanishingly small proportion of them (as the number of leaves grows). In this short paper, we explore whether this dichotomy phenomenon holds for other classes of phylogenetic networks, and their subclasses.

This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.

We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

Exploring Pintopia: Reflection Branes, Bordisms, and U-Dualities

The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.

Title:
Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras

Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.

Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks

In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.

The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs

On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.

Impossibility Results of Card-Based Protocols via Mathematical Optimization
Shunnosuke Ikeda, Kazumasa Shinagawa
Subjects:
Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper introduces mathematical optimization as a new method for proving impossibility results in the field of card-based cryptography. While previous impossibility proofs were often limited to cases involving a small number of cards, this new approach establishes results that hold for a large number of cards. The research focuses on single-cut full-open (SCFO) protocols, which consist of performing one random cut and then revealing all cards. The main contribution is that for any three-variable Boolean function, no new SCFO protocols exist beyond those already known, under the condition that all additional cards have the same color. The significance of this work is that it provides a new framework for proving impossibility results and delivers a proof that is valid for any number of cards, as long as all additional cards have the same color.

Title:
Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory
Ansh Nagda, Prabhakar Raghavan, Abhradeep Thakurta
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" Håstad-style PCPs.
A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.
