Title:
General Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian submersions and Riemannian maps
Ravindra Singh, Kiran Meena, Kapish Chand Meena

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We derive general forms of the Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian submersions between Riemannian manifolds. We also derive general forms of the Chen-Ricci and improved Chen-Ricci inequalities for Riemannian maps between Riemannian manifolds, involving the relations between curvatures of subspaces of source and target spaces. These general forms give new techniques that are easy, elegant, and fruitful to obtain the Chen-Ricci inequalities for such smooth mappings with various space forms. As applications, utilizing these general forms, we explicitly establish Chen-Ricci inequalities when the source manifolds of Riemannian submersions and the target manifolds of Riemannian maps belong to broader classes, such as generalized complex and generalized Sasakian space forms, particularly including real, complex, real Kähler, Sasakian, Kenmotsu, cosymplectic, and $C(\alpha)$ space forms. Furthermore, we provide Chen-Ricci inequalities for various types of geometrically structured Riemannian submersions and Riemannian maps, such as invariant, anti-invariant, semi-invariant, slant, semi-slant, and hemi-slant. In particular, imposing suitable circumstances towards validation, our inequalities become the same as various known inequalities established by many authors in [1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 29, 48, 49].

Title:
Knot Floer Homology, the Burau Representation, and Quantum $\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1)$
Joe Boninger

44 pages, 10 figures, comments welcome!
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
The Burau representation of braid groups and knot Floer homology share a link to the Fox calculus. We make this connection explicit, with the following outcome: if $B$ is the full Burau matrix of any braid, and $A$ is any square submatrix of $B - \lambda I$, we define a Heegaard Floer homology theory that categorifies $\det(A)$ and is an invariant of the braid. We also describe an analogous construction for the Gassner representation. Then, we leverage the relationship between the Burau representation and quantum $\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1)$ to exhibit connections between the latter and Heegaard Floer homology. We associate a bordered sutured Heegaard Floer homology group to any tangle, and give a simple, geometric proof that our invariant recovers the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1 \vert 1))$ braid representation.

Title:
Incidence of lines, points, and planes in $PG(3,q)$ with respect to the twisted cubic
Krishna Kaipa, Puspendu Pradhan
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We consider the orbits of the group $G=PGL_2(q)$ on the points, lines and planes of the projective space $PG(3,q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$. The points of $PG(3,q)$ can be identified with projective space of binary cubic forms, and the set $\mathcal L$ of lines of $PG(3,q)$ can be thought of as pencils of cubic forms. The action of $G$ on $PG(1,q)$ naturally induces an action of $G$ on binary cubic forms $f(X,Y)$. The points of $PG(3, q)$ decompose into five $G$ orbits. The $G$ orbits on $\mathcal L$ were recently obtained by the authors. Let $\mathcal I$ be the subset of $\mathcal L \times PG(3,q)$ consisting of pairs $(L,P)$ where $L$ is a line incident with the point $P$. The decomposition of $\mathcal L \times PG(3,q)$ into $G \times G$ orbits yields a partition of $\mathcal I$. The problem that we solve in this work is to determine the sizes of the corresponding parts of $\mathcal I$.

Title:
Entropy approximations of algebraic matroids over finite fields
Guillermo Matera
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Information Theory (cs.IT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)
We investigate the asymptotic behavior of entropy polymatroids associated with algebraic matroids over finite fields. Given an algebraic matroid ${\sf M}:=(\mathcal{E},r)$ and the irreducible variety $V$ associated with ${\sf M}$, we consider the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ induced by the entropies of the projections of $V(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{G}$. Revisiting a construction of Matú$\check{\mathrm{s}}$, we show that the polymatroid $h_{\mathbb{F}}$ converges to the rank function $r$ of ${\sf M}$ as $q:=|\mathbb{F}|$ tends to infinity.
Our main contribution is to make this convergence quantitative: we derive explicit uniform error bounds for the deviation $|h_\mathbb{F}-r|$, expressed in terms of the degree of $V$, the ground set size $|\mathcal{E}|$, the rank $r(\mathcal{E})$, and $q$. The proofs combine tools of algebraic geometry (effective Lang-Weil estimates and intrinsic degree bounds for annihilating polynomials of circuits) with information-theoretic arguments (submodularity of entropy and conditional entropy estimates).
These results provide the first effective and uniform approximation bounds for algebraic matroids by entropy polymatroids, clarifying the quantitative link between algebraic independence (captured by matroid rank) and information-theoretic independence (captured by entropy).

Diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Combinatorics (math.CO); Group Theory (math.GR); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We prove strong, explicit diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras that parallel Babai's conjecture for finite simple groups. Specifically, we show that any nonabelian finite simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbf{F}_p$ has diameter $O((\log{|\mathfrak{g}|})^D)$ for $D \approx 3.21$ with respect to any generating set. For absolutely simple classical Lie algebras over $\mathbf{F}_p$, we establish the sharper bound $O(\log{|\mathfrak{g}|})$ when the Lie type is fixed and generators are chosen uniformly at random.

Title:
On the convergence rate in the central limit theorem for linearly extended negative quadrant dependent random variables and its applications
Mohamed Kaber El Alem, Zohra Guessoum, Abdelkader Tatachak, Ourida Sadki

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In this paper, we establish the convergence rate in central limit theorem (CLT) for linearly extended negative quadrant dependent (LENQD) random variables (rv's). Under some weak conditions, the rate of normal approximation is shown as $O(n^{-1/9})$. As an application, the convergence rate in CLT of the wavelet estimator for the nonparametric regression model with LENQD errors is presented as $O(n^{-1/9})$. The performance of the main results is illustrated through a simulation study based on a real dataset.

Title:
Large gaps between values of several binary quadratic forms
Błażej Żmija
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In this paper we study the problem of long gaps between values of binary quadratic forms. Let $D_{1}$, $D_{2},\ldots ,D_{r}$ be negative integers and $(s_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be the sequence of all the numbers representable by any binary quadratic form of discriminant $D_{1}$, $D_{2}$, $\ldots$ or $D_{r}$, and let $d :={\rm lcm}\{D_{1},\ldots ,D_{r}\}$. We show that then \begin{align*} \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{s_{n+1}-s_{n}}{\log s_{n}}\geq \frac{1}{\log d + \log\log d + \log\log\log d + 4}. \end{align*} This improves and generalises a result by Dietmann, Elsholtz, Kalmynin, Konyagin, and Maynard.
As a by-product of our preliminary results, we show an improvement to the Pólya-Vinogradov inequality.

Title:
Construction of multi-solitary waves solution to the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation outside an obstacle in the $L^2$-subcritical case
Oussama Landoulsi
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the focusing $L^2$-subcritical Schrödinger equation in the exterior of a smooth, compact, strictly convex obstacle $\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We construct a solution that, for large times, behaves asymptotically as a finite sum of solitary waves on $\mathbb{R}^d$, each traveling with sufficiently large and distinct velocities, and satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. The construction is achieved via a compactness argument similar to that introduced by this http URL in 1990 for constructing solutions of the NLS equation that blow up at several points, combined with modulation theory, the coercivity property of the linearized operator, and localized energy estimates.

Pseudo-Anosov Flows: A Plane Approach
Thomas Barthelmé, Kathryn Mann
Comments:
136 pages, v1: First complete, public, version. Please don't hesitate to send us comments, including detected typos
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Geometric Topology (math.GT)
In this text we (re)-tell the theory of pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds with the orbit space as the central character; via a streamlined framework called {\em Anosov-like group actions}. This brings a simplified and unified perspective, and allows for the import of tools from 1- and 2-dimensional topological dynamics. In so doing, we are able to give a relatively efficient presentation (or re-presentation) of foundational results in the field which appeared over several decades and many papers.
We hope that the reader, whether a beginning or more advanced topologist or dynamicist, finds this a welcoming invitation to the rich theory of pseudo-Anosov flows.

Variable-preconditioned transformed primal-dual method for generalized Wasserstein Gradient Flows
Jin Zeng, Dawei Zhan, Ruchi Guo, Chaozhen Wei
Comments:
20 pages, 10 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose a Variable-Preconditioned Transformed Primal-Dual (VPTPD) method for solving generalized Wasserstein gradient flows via a structure-preserving JKO scheme. This is a nontrivial extension of the TPD method [Chen et al. (2023) arXiv:2312.12355] incorporating proximal splitting techniques to address the challenges arising from the nonsmoothness of the objective function. Our key contributions include: (i) a semi-implicit-explicit iteration that combines proximal steps for the nonsmooth part with explicit gradient steps for the smooth part, and variable preconditioners constructed from the Hessian of a regularized objective to balance iteration count and per-iteration cost; (ii) a proof of existence and uniqueness of bounded solutions for the resulting generalized proximal operator, along with a convergent and bound-preserving Newton solver; and (iii) an adaptive step-size strategy to improve robustness and accelerate convergence under poor Lipschitz conditions of the energy derivative. Comprehensive numerical experiments spanning from 1D to 3D settings demonstrate that our method achieves superior computational efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its broad applicability through several challenging simulations.

Global coalition sets in graphs
Nazli Besharati, Doost Ali Mojdeh, Mohammad Reza Samadzadeh
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. A subset $S \subseteq V$ is called a global dominating set of $G$, if it serves as a dominating set in both $G$ and its complement $\overline{G}$. We define two disjoint subsets $V_1,V_2 \subseteq V$ to form a global coalition if neither $V_1$ nor $V_2$ individually constitutes a global dominating set, yet their union $V_1 \cup V_2$ does. A global coalition partition (abbreviated as $gc$-partition) of $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi$ of $V(G)$ such that for every subset $V_i \in \pi$, there exists another subset $V_j \in \pi$ with which $V_i$ forms a global coalition. In this paper, we initiate the study of global coalition in graphs. Specifically, we prove that every graph admits a gc-partition. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the number of global coalitions in which each member of a gc-partition can participate. We also explore the relationships between global coalition and coalition, as well as between global coalition and perfect coalition in graphs. Finally, we explore properties of $gc$-partitions in unicyclic graphs.

Packing stability and the subleading asymptotics of symplectic Weyl laws
Oliver Edtmair
Comments:
62 pages, 21 figures
Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
We prove that symplectic ball packing stability holds for every compact, connected symplectic $4$-manifold with smooth boundary. This follows from a stronger result: the full volume of any such manifold can be filled by a single symplectic ellipsoid. As an application, we obtain estimates - with sharp exponents - for the error terms in the symplectic Weyl laws for embedded contact homology capacities, periodic Floer homology spectral invariants, and link spectral invariants. We also construct an example of a star-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^4$, arbitrarily $C^1$ close to the unit ball and with boundary of regularity just below $C^2$ and smooth away from a single point, for which packing stability fails. Our proofs reveal a close connection between symplectic packing stability in the presence of smooth boundary and the algebraic structure of Hamiltonian diffeomorphism groups, particularly Banyaga's simplicity results.

The nucleus of the Grassmann graph $J_q(N,D)$
Jae-Ho Lee, Jongyook Park, Ian Seong
Comments:
24 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $N$ and $D$ denote integers with $N>D \ge 1$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ denote an $N$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$. The Grassmann graph $J_q(N,D)$ is the graph with vertex set $X$ that consists of the $D$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$. Two vertices are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $D-1$. Fix a vertex $x$ in $X$. The Terwilliger algebra $T=T(x)$ of $J_q(N,D)$ with respect to $x$ is the subalgebra of $\mathrm{Mat}_X(\mathbb{C})$ generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ and the dual adjacency matrix $A^* = A^*(x)$. It is known that an irreducible $T$-module $W$ has certain parameters called the endpoint $r$, the dual endpoint $t$, and the diameter $d$. The displacement of $W$ is defined to be the integer $r+t-D+d$. Let $\mathcal{N}=\mathcal{N}(x)$ denote the span of all irreducible $T$-modules with displacement 0. We call $\mathcal{N}$ the nucleus of $J_q(N,D)$ with respect to $x$. In this paper, we study the structure of $\mathcal{N}$. Specifically, we present a formula for the dimension of $\mathcal{N}$, construct two explicit bases for $\mathcal{N}$, and describe the action of $A$ and $A^*$ on these bases. To obtain these results, we use the projective geometry $P_q(N)$, consisting of all subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$, as a key tool.

In this paper we present an ADE-type classification of hypersurfaces of complete regular local rings based on their Cohen-Macaulay type. In order to preform this classification, we show how we can generalize the classical result regarding finite and countable Cohen-Macaulay type to larger cardinalities, depending on the cardinality of the residue field.

On 1-absorbing prime and weakly 1-absorbing prime subsemimodules
Mohammad adarbeh, Mohammad Saleh
Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
In this paper, we introduce the concepts of 1-absorbing prime and weakly 1-absorbing prime subsemimodules over commutative semirings. Let S be a commutative semiring with 1 \neq 0 and M an S-semimodule. A proper subsemimodule N of M is called 1-absorbing prime (weakly 1-absorbing prime) if, for all nonunits a, b \in S and m \in M, abm \in N (0 \neq abm \in N) implies ab \in (N :_{S} M) or m \in N. We study many properties of these concepts. For example, we show that a proper subsemimodule N of M is 1-absorbing prime if and only if for all proper ideals I, J of S and subsemimodule K of M with IJK \subseteq N, either IJ \subseteq (N:_{S} M) or K \subseteq N. Also, we prove that a proper subtractive subsemimodule N of M is weakly 1-absorbing prime if and only if for all proper ideals I, J of S and subsemimodule K of M with 0 \neq IJK \subseteq N, either IJ \subseteq (N:_{S} M) or K \subseteq N.

Understanding two-scale criteria for Poincaré and log-Sobolev inequalities in the Euclidean case through Φ-entropies
Vishwak Srinivasan
Comments:
25 pages. Comments welcome!
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We study settings in which mixture and joint distributions satisfy a Poincaré (or log-Sobolev) inequality induced by a marginal and a collection of conditional distributions that are assumed to satisfy Poincaré (or log-Sobolev, resp.) inequalities and supported over Euclidean spaces. In this note, we use the framework of $\Phi$-Sobolev inequalities (Chafaï, 2004) to provide a unified approach to arriving at these inequalities in the Euclidean case. This results in a simpler proof technique for establishing these functional inequalities under certain two-scale criteria. We also discuss applications of these results to certain sampling algorithms.

Enhancing Physical Layer Security in IoT-Based RF-FSO Integrated Networks: Multi-RIS Structures and their Impact on Secure Communication
Anika Tabassum Biva, Md. Ibrahim, A. S. M. Badrudduza, Imran Shafique Ansari
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Due to their ability to dynamically control the propagation environment, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a promising solution to address the challenges of $6$G wireless communication, especially in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper investigates a mixed communication model with multi-RIS-aided radio frequency (RF)-free space optics (FSO) to enhance the performance of IoT applications in complex environments. An eavesdropper is assumed to be present, attempting to intercept confidential information transmitted over the RF link. All RF links are modeled using Rician fading, while the FSO link accounts for Málaga turbulence with pointing errors, capturing real-world propagation conditions. Closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability, average secrecy capacity, and effective secrecy throughput in terms of Meijer's G function. To gain further insight, high signal-to-noise approximations of these metrics are also presented. Numerical results highlight the importance of heterodyne detection in mitigating the adverse effects of pointing errors on the FSO link. Moreover, integrating a multi-RIS structure into the proposed model significantly increases secrecy performance, achieving up to a $47.67\%$ improvement in SOP compared to conventional methods. Finally, the derived analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

The paper shows the existence of a family of directed strongly regular graphs with parameters (22, 9, 6, 3, 4). The adjacency matrices of the found digraphs are composed of $3\times 3$ circulant blocks. The automorphism group of all the digraphs found is the group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. The structure of the resulting digraphs is described using concepts of skeleton and rigging.

Rearrangement Invariant Orthogonal Sums in Krein Spaces. II
Michael A. Dritschel, Alejandra Maestripieri, James Rovnyak
Comments:
27 pages, submitted
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Part I of the paper considered infinite orthogonal sums of regular subspaces in a Krein space (that is, of subspaces which are themselves Krein spaces). How precisely these sums should be defined and conditions for when such a sum is itself regular were examined. These included, for example, a boundedness condition for the sum of the corresponding orthogonal projections. The same problem is addressed here for (quasi-)pseudo-regular subspaces. Such subspaces happen to be the orthogonal direct sum of a regular space and an isotropic, or neutral, subspace. Alternate characterizations of such subspaces are given, along with various examples and counter-examples. The infinite orthogonal sum of these is then considered.

Invariant Rings of $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-Representations are not always Finitely Generated in Positive Characteristic
Stephen Maguire

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Hilbert's 14th Problem asks the following question. Given a linear representation $ \beta: G \to \operatorname{GL}(\mathbf{V}) $ of a linear algebraic group over a field $ k $ is the ring $ S_{k}(\mathbf{V}^{\ast}) $ a finitely generated $ k $-algebra? For reductive groups the answer is yes. However, in general the answer is no. Nagata provided one of the earliest counterexamples to this claim and his counterexample was extended by Shigeru Mukai. However, if $ G $ is equal to $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $ and the characteristic of $ k $ is equal to zero, then the answer to Hilbert's 14th problem is yes. Roland Weitzenböck first proved this result in 1932 in an article in Acta Mathematica. Seshadri gave a more accessible proof.
While Roland Weitzenböck did not conjecture this claim, the question of whether the theorem that bears his name still holds if the characteristic of the base field $ k $ is $ p>0 $ is known as ``the Weitzenböck conjecture''. We aim to use Mukai's strategy to give a counterexample to the Weitzenböck conjecture. Namely, we construct a six dimensional representation over a field of positive characteristic such that the invariant ring is isomorphic to the Cox ring of the blow-up of a toric surface at the identity of the torus. We use the geometry of the underlying toric variety to show that this Cox ring is not finitely generated.

On the Invariant Theory of $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-Actions from a Geometric Perspective
Stephen Maguire
Comments:

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In this paper we give a strict classification of $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-representations. This is done through the notion of a $ c(t) $-pair. Namely if $ \operatorname{Spec}(A) $ is a $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-variety with action $ \beta $, then a $ c(t) $-pair is a pair of elements $ (g,h) $ such that $ g(t_{0} \ast x) = g(x)+c(t_{0}) h(x) $. This allows us to describe exactly when an affine, $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-stable, sub-variety $ D(h) $ is a trivial bundle over $ D(h)//\mathbb{G}_{a} $. If $ \operatorname{Spec}(A) $ is a $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-variety, we define the large pedestal ideal $ \mathfrak{P}_{g}(A) $ and the pedestal ideal $ \mathfrak{P}(A) $. If $ \beta: \mathbb{G}_{a} \to \operatorname{GL}(\mathbf{V}) $ is a $ \mathbb{G}_{a} $-representation, then we classify such a representation on whether: a) the large pedestal ideal $ \mathfrak{P}_{g}(S_{k}(\mathbf{V}^{\ast})) $ is equal to zero. b) the large pedestal ideal is non-zero, but the pedestal ideal is equal to zero. or c) the pedestal ideal is non-zero.

This paper is a generalization of a previous paper by the author to connected unipotent linear algebraic groups. The notion of an $ \alpha $-pair answers when an open $ G $-stable, affine, sub-variety $ D(H) $ is a trivial bundle over $ G \backslash \backslash D(H) $ in the Zariski topology, or whether there is an fppf topology $ \phi: U \to D(H) $ such that $ U $ is a trivial bundle over $ G \backslash \backslash U $ and such that the fibres $ \phi^{-1}(x) \cong \ker(\alpha) $. We also describe a generalization of van den Essen's algorithm for quasi-principle $ G $-varieties $ \operatorname{Spec}(A) $.

On the pair correlation function of the Sine$_β$ process

Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the Sine$_\beta$ process, the bulk point process scaling limit of beta-ensembles. We provide a representation of its pair correlation function for all $\beta>0$ via a stochastic differential equation. We show that the pair correlation function is continuous in $\beta$, and provide estimates for its asymptotic decay. We recover the classical explicit formula for the pair correlation function in the $\beta=2$ and $4$ cases. For $\beta=2n$, we derive the power series expansion of the pair correlation function, and express it in terms of a size $n$ linear ordinary differential equation system. We obtain our results by studying the density of the $\operatorname{HP}_{\beta,\delta}$ process, the point process limit of the circular Jacobi beta-ensembles.

Linear recoloring diameter of degenerate chordal graphs and bounded treewidth graphs
Yichen Wang, Mei Lu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $t$ an integer. The reconfiguration graph of $G$, denoted by $R_t(G)$, consists of all $t$-colorings of $G$ and two $t$-colorings are adjacent if they differ on exactly one vertex. The $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is the diameter of $R_t(G)$. For a $d$-degenerate graph $G$, $R_t(G)$ is connected when $t \ge d+2$~(Dyer et al., 2006). Furthermore, the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n^2)$ when $t \ge 3(d+1)/2$~(Bousquet et al., 2022), and it is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2d+2$~(Bousquet and Perarnau, 2016). For a $d$-degenerate and chordal graph $G$, the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is $O(n^2)$ when $t \ge d+2$~(Bonamy et al. 2014). If $G$ is a graph of treewidth at most $k$, then $G$ is also $k$-degenerate, and the previous results hold. Moreover, when $t \ge k+2$, the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n^2)$~(Bonamy and Bousquet, 2013). When $k=2$, the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is linear when $t \ge 5$~(Bartier, Bousquet and Heinrich, 2021) and the result is tight. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is $d$-degenerate and chordal, then the $t$-recoloring diameter of $G$ is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2d+1$. Moreover, if the treewidth of $G$ is at most $k$, then the $t$-recoloring diameter is $O(n)$ when $t \ge 2k+1$. This result is a generalization of the previous results on graphs of treewidth at most two.

Let $W_{t\times t}$ be the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid and let $\mathcal{L}_t$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that $G$ is the line graph of some subdivision of $W_{t \times t}$. We denote by $\omega(G)$ the size of the largest clique in $G$. We prove that for every integer $t$ there exist integers $c_1(t)$, $c_2(t)$ and $d(t)$ such that every (pyramid, theta, $\mathcal{L}_t$)-free graph $G$ satisfies: i) $G$ has a tree decomposition where every bag has size at most $\omega(G)^{c_1(t)} \log (|V(G)|)$. ii) If $G$ has at least two vertices, then $G$ has a tree decomposition where every bag has independence number at most $\log^{c_2(t)} (|V(G)|)$. iii) For any weight function, $G$ has a balanced separator that is contained in the union of the neighborhoods of at most $d(t)$ vertices. These results qualitatively generalize the main theorems of Abrishami et al. (2022) and Chudnovsky et al. (2024). Additionally, we show that there exist integers $c_3(t), c_4(t)$ such that for every (theta, pyramid)-free graph $G$ and for every non-adjacent pair of vertices $a,b \in V(G)$, i) $a$ can be separated from $b$ by removing at most $w(G)^{c_3(t)}\log(|V(G)|)$ vertices. ii) $a$ can be separated from $b$ by removing a set of vertices with independence number at most $\log^{c_4(t)}(|V(G)|)$.

Counting induced subgraphs with given intersection sizes
Haixiang Zhang, Yichen Wang, Xiamiao Zhao, Mei Lu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $F$ be a graph of order $r$. In this paper, we study the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ with restricted intersections, which highlights the motivation from extremal set theory. Let $L=\{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s\}\subseteq[0,r-1]$ be an integer set with $s\not\in\{1,r\}$. Let $\Psi_r(n,F,L)$ be the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ in an $n$-vertex graph, where the induced copies of $F$ are $L$-intersecting as a family of $r$-subsets, i.e., for any two induced copies of $F$, the size of their intersection is in $L$. Helliar and Liu initiated a study of the function $\Psi_r(n,K_r,L)$. Very recently, Zhao and Zhang improved their result and showed that $\Psi_r(n,K_r,L)=\Theta_{r,L}(n^{s})$ if and only if $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ form an arithmetic progression. In this paper, we show that $\Psi_r(n,F,L)=o_{r,L}(n^{s})$ when $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ do not form an arithmetic progression. We study the asymptotical result of $\Psi_r(n,C_r,L)$, and determined the asymptotically optimal result when $\ell_1,\dots,\ell_s,r$ form an arithmetic progression and take certain values. We also study the generalized Turán problem, determining the maximum number of $H$, where the copies of $H$ are $L$-intersecting as a family of $r$-subsets. The entropy method is used to prove our results.

Decentralized Estimation and Control for Leader-Follower Networked Systems with Asymmetric Information Structure

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, the decentralized estimation and linear quadratic (LQ) control problem for a leader-follower networked system (LFNS) is studied from the perspective of asymmetric information. Specifically, for a leader-follower network, the follower agent will be affected by the leader agent, while the follower agent will not affect the leader agent. Hence, the information sets accessed by the control variables of the leader agent and the follower agent are asymmetric, which will bring essential difficulties in finding the optimal control strategy. To this end, the orthogonal decomposition method is adopted to achieve the main results. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the optimal iterative estimation is derived using the conditional independence property established in this paper. Secondly, the optimal decentralized control strategy is derived by decoupling the forward-backward stochastic difference equations (FBSDEs), based on the derived optimal iterative estimation. Thirdly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback stabilization of the LFNS in infinite-horizon are derived. Finally, the proposed theoretical results are applied to solve the decentralized control problem of a leader-follower autonomous underwater vehicle (LF-AUV) system. The optimal control inputs for the AUVs are provided, and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Introducing the method of ellipcenters, a new first order technique for unconstrained optimization
Roger Behling, Ramyro Aquines Correa, Eduarda Ferreira Zanatta, Vincent Guigues
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we introduce the Method of Ellipcenters (ME) for unconstrained minimization. At the cost of two gradients per iteration and a line search, we compute the next iterate by setting it as the center of an elliptical interpolation. The idea behind the ellipse built in each step is to emulate the original level curve of the objective function constrained to a suitable two-dimensional affine space, which is determined by the current iterate and two appropriate gradient vectors. We present the method for general unconstrained minimization and carry out a convergence analysis for the case where the objective function is quadratic. In this context, ME enjoys linear convergence with the rate being at least as good as the linear rate of the steepest descent (gradient) method with optimal step. In our experiments, however, ME was much faster than the gradient method with optimal step size. Moreover, ME seems highly competitive in comparison to several well established algorithms, including Nesterov's accelerated gradient, Barzilai-Borwein, and conjugate gradient. The efficiency in terms of both time and number of iterations is stressed even more for ill-conditioned problems. A theoretical feature that might be a reason for this is that ME coincides with Newton for quadratic programs in two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, solving them in one single step. In our numerical tests, convergence in one iteration only was also observed for much larger problem sizes.

Numerical Discretization Methods for Seismic Response Analysis of SDOF Systems: A Unified Perspective
Farid Ghahari
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper reviews the most commonly used numerical methods for solving the differential equation governing the dynamic response of linear elastic Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) systems. For more than 80 years since its introduction, the response spectrum has remained the cornerstone of every seismic design code. The second-order differential equation that governs the dynamic response of a linear elastic SDOF system must be solved numerically to generate such response spectra. Although only one or two well-accepted time-discretization methods have been predominantly used by the earthquake engineering community over the past decades, these methods are directly or indirectly related to a broader family of methods for solving Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, which have been extensively applied in other branches of engineering, particularly electrical engineering. It has recently come to my attention that a portion of our community, particularly students, may not be fully familiar with these methods. In this paper, I review these methods and describe their mathematical background, with a focus on the relative displacement of the SDOF system under ground acceleration-an essential quantity for various types of response spectra. I also briefly review some of the numerical methods traditionally used within our community, highlighting their similarities and differences. I evaluate the accuracy of all numerical methods introduced in this paper through several examples with available analytical solutions. This study focuses on time-domain solutions that can be employed for real- or near-real-time response prediction, which is particularly important for applications such as earthquake early warning and post-earthquake assessment. The paper is written to enable readers to implement these methods with minimal effort; however, MATLAB codes for all methods discussed are also provided.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study asymptotic properties of supercritical Galton-Watson (GW) branching processes in the asymptotic where the mean of the offspring distribution approaches 1 from above. We show that the population-size distribution of the GW branching processes at a sufficiently large generation in this asymptotic can be approximated by a compound Poisson-gamma distribution. Numerical experiments revealed that the compound Poisson-gamma models were in good agreement with the corresponding GW models for sufficiently large generations under a reasonable parameter regime. Our results can be regarded as supporting the use of the compound Poisson-gamma model as a model for cascaded multiplication processes, such as detection signals of electron multipliers and population sizes of individuals with specific biological characteristics.

Time-inconsistent reinsurance and investment optimization problem with delay under random risk aversion
Jian-hao Kang, Zhun Gou, Nan-jing Huang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper considers a newly delayed reinsurance and investment optimization problem incorporating random risk aversion, in which an insurer pursues maximization of the expected certainty equivalent of her/his terminal wealth and the cumulative delayed information of the wealth over a period. Specially, the insurer's surplus dynamics are approximated using a drifted Brownian motion, while the financial market is described by the Black-Scholes model. Moreover, the performance-linked capital flow feature is incorporated and the wealth process is formulated via a stochastic delay differential equation (SDDE). By adopting a game-theoretic approach, a verification theorem with rigorous proofs is established to capture the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategy along with the equilibrium value function. Furthermore, for the cases of exponential utility and power utility, analytical or semi-analytical equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies together with their equilibrium value functions are obtained under mild conditions. Finally, several numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the behavioral characteristics of the freshly-derived equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategy.

Spotlight inversion by orthogonal projections

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In inverse problems, the goal is to estimate unknown parameters from indirect noisy observations. It is not uncommon that the forward model assigning the observed variables to given values of the unknowns depend on variables that are not of primary interest, often referred to as nuisance parameters. In this article, we consider linear inverse problems, and propose a novel technique, based on linear algebra and orthogonal projections, to eliminate, or at least mitigate, the contribution of the nuisance parameters on the data. The approach is referred to as spotlight inversion, as it allows to focus on the part of primary interest of the unknown parameter, leaving the uninteresting part in the shadow. The viability of the approach is demonstrated by a computed example of local fanbeam X-ray tomography: the spotlight is on the region of interest that is part of the full target.

The formal theory of tangentads
Marcello Lanfranchi
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT)
Tangent categories offer a categorical context for differential geometry, by categorifying geometric notions like the tangent bundle functor, vector fields, Euclidean spaces, vector bundles, connections, etc. In the last decade, the theory has been extended in new directions, providing concepts such as tangent monads, tangent fibrations, tangent restriction categories, reverse tangent categories and many more.
It is natural to wonder how these new flavours interact with the geometric constructions offered by the theory. How does a tangent monad or a tangent fibration lift to the tangent category of vector fields of a tangent category? What is the correct notion of vector bundles for a tangent restriction category?
In this paper, we answer these questions by adopting the formal approach of tangentads. Introduced in a previous paper, tangentads proved to be a powerful tool for capturing the different flavours of the theory and for extending constructions like the Grothendieck construction or the equivalence between split restriction categories and $\mathscr{M}$-categories, to the tangent-categorical context.
We construct formal notions of vector fields, differential objects, differential bundles, and connections for tangentads by isolating the correct universal properties enjoyed by these constructions in ordinary tangent categories. We show that vector fields form a Lie algebra and a $2$-monad; we extend the result that differential bundles over the terminal object are equivalent to differential objects; we recapture the notions of covariant derivative, curvature and torsion for connections. We also show how to construct vector fields and connections using PIE limits, and we compute the formal constructions for some examples of tangentads.

Continuity in $ξ$ and $ξ\to \infty$ tightness of the LQG metric
Konstantinos Kavvadias
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We show that the law of the $\gamma$-LQG metric (appropriately renormalized) is continuous in $\gamma \in (0,2)$ with respect to the local uniform topology of metrics on $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ whenever $\gamma$ lies on compact subsets of $(0,2)$. Moreover we show that as $\gamma \to 0$, the $\gamma$-LQG metric (appropriately renormalized) converges to the Euclidean metric with respect to the local uniform topology of metrics on $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$. More generally, we show that the law of the LQG metric with parameter $\xi>0$ (appropriately renormalized) is tight with respect to the topology on lower semicontinuous functions on $\mathbf{C} \times \mathbf{C}$ whenever $\xi$ lies on compact subsets of $(0,\infty)$, and any subsequential limit in law is non-trivial almost surely. If in addition we assume that the limit satisfies the triangle inequality almost surely, then it has the law of an LQG metric with an appropriate parameter $\xi$. Finally we examine the limit as $\xi \to \infty$, which is a regime that has not been studied before. More precisely we show that if $D_h^{\xi}$ denotes the LQG metric with parameter $\xi>0$ (appropriately renormalized) associated with the whole-plane GFF $h$, the family of metrics $(D_h^{\xi})^{1 / \xi}$ is tight as $\xi \to \infty$ and any subsequential limit is non-trivial almost surely. If in addition we assume that the subsequential limit satisfies the triangle inequality almost surely, then the limit is a metric almost surely.

Direct Estimation of Eigenvalues of Large Dimensional Precision Matrix
Jie Zhou, Junhao Xie, Jiaqi Chen
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Applications (stat.AP)
In this paper, we consider directly estimating the eigenvalues of precision matrix, without inverting the corresponding estimator for the eigenvalues of covariance matrix. We focus on a general asymptotic regime, i.e., the large dimensional regime, where both the dimension $N$ and the sample size $K$ tend to infinity whereas their quotient $N/K$ converges to a positive constant. By utilizing tools from random matrix theory, we construct an improved estimator for eigenvalues of precision matrix. We prove the consistency of the new estimator under large dimensional regime. In order to obtain the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator, we provide a theoretical result that characterizes the convergence rate of the expected Stieltjes transform (with its derivative) of the spectra of the sample covariance matrix. Using this result, we prove that the asymptotic bias term of the proposed estimator is of order $O(1/K^2)$. Additionally, we establish a central limiting theorem (CLT) to describe the fluctuations of the new estimator. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to validate the excellent performance of the new estimator and to verify the accuracy of the CLT.

Uniform Sampling from the Reachable Set Using Optimal Transport
Karthik Elamvazhuthi, Sachin Shivakumar
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Finding the reachable set of a system has a wide range of applications, but is a fundamental challenge in control theory, especially when controls are bounded. Although one can simply integrate the system samples forward in time by applying random admissible control to approximate the reachable set, the samples typically cluster near an attractor (if one is present) -- yielding a poor representation of the reachable set. A better representation can be found by applying controls that specifically lead to a uniform terminal state distribution, however, finding such controls is non-trivial. To find such controls, one must solve an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with uniform measure as the target distribution, which is difficult since the reachable set is not know \emph{a priori}.
We can overcome this difficulty by softening the terminal measure constraint via the introduction of a $L_2$-entropy function in the objective and can further reduce this infinite-dimensional regularized OT to a finite-dimensional particle-based optimal control problem by using a nonlocal kernel regularization of the entropy. This leads to a hierarchy of optimization problems whose solutions converge to the original reachability sampling OT problem, as proved by $\Gamma$-convergence. The effectiveness of this entropy-regularized particle-based approach for uniform sampling of reachable set is demonstrated using numerical examples.

We study the global existence of solutions to a class of nonlocal Geirer-Meinhardt system. This is a two component reaction-diffusion model on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 1$, with nonlocal diffusion given by a nonlocal convolution operator. We have used semigroup theory and derive estimate to guarantee global existence. Then we build an $L^b$ functional to bound our solution independent of the nonlocal convolution kernel for $2 \le b < \infty$. Next, we have used this result to obtain a diffusive limit similar to \cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal} for our model. We also numerically simulate our model to show the formation of patterns by this model and compare the results with the patterns with the traditional local/classical Geirer-Meinhardt model.

Ranks of Checkered Pattern Matrices with Applications to Information Embedding and Retrieving

Comments:

Subjects:
History and Overview (math.HO); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Checkered patterns are characterized by their square structure and the use of only two distinct colors. These colors are typically represented by two types of numerical sets: {1,0} and {1,-1}. Matrices based on {1,0} may seem identical to those based on {1,-1} when forming checkered patterns because the only difference is that the numbers 0 are changed to -1. However, these two kinds of matrices are completely different in a mathematical sense because a matrix using {1,0} has a rank of 2 and a matrix using {1,-1} has a rank of 1. Knowing this difference in advance allows us to reduce the computational effort required for matrix operations such as information embedding and retrieving.

Numbers in the base $e^π$

Subjects:

A large-scale experiment was conducted to find formulas relating to the base $e^\pi$. The numbers in this base are $$x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {a(n)\over e^{\pi n}}$$ where $a(n)$ is taken from the OEIS catalog. These
experiments were inspired by several facts. Indeed, it is known that the formula generating the partitions of integers is generated by an infinite product $$\prod_{k\ge1}^\infty {1\over 1-x^k} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n)x^n$$ that when evaluated at $x=e^{-\pi}$ is equal to $${2^{3/8} \Gamma(3/4) \over \pi^{1/4} e^{\pi/24}}\ .\qquad\qquad (1)$$ By analyzing the 387500 sequences of the OEIS catalog, the model that was used is based on the fact that the infinite sum evaluated at $e^\pi$, is an expression that can be detected using a program like lindep from Pari-Gp. The process made it possible to find 793 expresssions similar to (1).

Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their Étale Homotopical Invariants
Dongfang Zhao
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Number Theory (math.NT)
The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing the geometric structure of semantic spaces in modern large language models, whose foundational architecture is the Transformer. The token spaces of these models are fundamentally arithmetic, and recent work has revealed complex geometric singularities, challenging the classical manifold hypothesis.
This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of étale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the étale mismatch torsor, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic measure of the global relationship between the two morphisms.
Our main theorem provides a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first étale cohomology group $H^1_{\text{ét}}(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{ét}}(S)})$. This result yields a discrete, algebraic invariant that replaces the non-intrinsic, metric-based notions of approximation first explored in applied contexts. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields to illustrate its connection to classical problems. This work introduces new homotopical invariants to arithmetic geometry, opening new avenues for the structural analysis of complex discrete systems.

Zero-cycles on varieties over a $\mathfrak{B}_s$-field

A field $F$ is a $\mathfrak{B}_s$-field if, for every finite extension $E'/E$ of $F$, the norm map $K_s^M(E')\to K_s^M(E)$ of the Milnor $K$-groups is surjective. In particular, finite fields ($s=1$), local fields, and certain global fields (with $s=2$) satisfy this condition. For such a field $F$ and a $d$-dimensional variety $X$ over $F$, we prove that $CH^{d+n}(X,n)$ is divisible for $n \geq s+1$, and $CH^{d+s}(X,s)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Milnor $K$-group $K_{s}^M(F)$ and a divisible group. As an application, we study the Kato homology groups $KH_0^{(n)}(X,\mathbb{Z}/l^r\mathbb{Z})$ for any prime $l$ different from the characteristic of $F$.

Numerical Analysis of Simultaneous Reconstruction of Initial Condition and Potential in Subdiffusion
Xu Wu, Jiang Yang, Zhi Zhou
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper investigates the simultaneous identification of a spatially dependent potential and the initial condition in a subdiffusion model based on two terminal observations. The existence, uniqueness, and conditional stability of the inverse problem are established under weak regularity assumptions through a constructive fixed-point iteration approach. The theoretical analysis further inspires the development of an easy-to-implement iterative algorithm. A fully discrete scheme is then proposed, combining the finite element method for spatial discretization, convolution quadrature for temporal discretization, and the quasi-boundary value method to handle the ill-posedness of recovering the initial condition. Inspired by the conditional stability estimate, we demonstrate the linear convergence of the iterative algorithm and provide a detailed error analysis for the reconstructed initial condition and potential. The derived \textsl{a priori} error estimate offers a practical guide for selecting regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes based on the noise level. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate and support our theoretical findings.

We introduce a differentiable syndrome loss function leveraging global codebook structure and a differential-attention mechanism optimizing bit and syndrome embedding interactions. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing transformer-based decoders, with our approach surpassing traditional belief propagation decoders for short-to-medium length LDPC codes.

This work focuses on a class of functional stochastic Hamiltonian systems with singular coefficients and state-dependent switching, in which the switching process has a countably infinite state space. First, by Girsanov's transformation, we establish the martingale solution of the system in each fixed switching case. Then, since the two components of the system are intertwined and correlated, we investigate the special case when the discrete component is independent of the continuous component. Based on these results, we obtain the well-posedness of the system with the aid of a martingale process. Finally, in order to establish the Feller property, we take advantage of appropriate Radon-Nikodym derivative and introduce a vector valued elliptic equation to handle the effect of the singular coefficients.

To meet the stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) of 6G and beyond networks, including ultra-massive machine-type communications (mMTC), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), it is necessary to evaluate the performance of FAS under limited channel uses across time, frequency, and other domains. By exploiting random matrix theory and extreme value theory (EVT), we characterize the effect of finite blocklength on key metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), via accurate estimation of interference caused by codeword correlation. Closed-form expressions for block error rate (BLER) and outage probability are derived, covering both conditional BLER (with channel state information, CSI) and statistical BLER (without CSI). The proposed analysis leverages Chernoff bounds and introduces a Taylor-expansion-assisted mean value theorem for integrals (MVTI) to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with conventional multi-antenna systems, the proposed FBL-FAS framework achieves higher energy and spectral efficiency under finite blocklength, making it a promising enabler for next-generation wireless networks.

A local limit theorem for lattice oscillating random walks
M. Peigné, C. Pham, T.D. Vo
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this paper, we obtain a local limit theorem for the Kemperman's model of oscillating random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$; it extends the existing results for classical random walks on $\mathbb Z$ or reflected random walks on $\mathbb N_0$. The key technical point is to control the long-term behavior of the embedding subprocess that characterizes the oscillations of the original random walk between $\mathbb Z^-$ and $\mathbb Z^+$ in both recurrent and transient cases. Then by combining an extension of \cite[Theorem 1.4]{gouezel} for the convergence of aperiodic sequence of renewal operators acting on a suitable functional Banach space and the decomposition of the trajectories of the random walk, we obtain the exact asymptotic for the return probability under some mild assumptions on the increment moments.

The random Kakutani fixed point theorem in random normed modules
Qiang Tu, Xiaohuan Mu, Tiexin Guo, Guang Yang, Yuanyuan Sun
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Based on the recently developed theory of random sequential compactness, we prove the random Kakutani fixed point theorem in random normed modules: if G is a random sequentially compact L0-convex subset of a random normed module, then every -stable Tc-upper semicontinuous mapping F:G to 2G such that F(x) is closed and L0-convex for each x in G, has a fixed point. This is the first fixed point theorem for set-valued mappings in random normed modules, providing a random generalization of the classical Kakutani fixed point theorem as well as a set-valued extension of the noncompact Schauder fixed point theorem established in Math. Ann. 391(3), 3863--3911 (2025).

On the structure and skeletals of principal ideal graphs of inverse semigroups
C S Preenu, R S Indu, Sijo George
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR); Combinatorics (math.CO)
The principal left ideal graph of a semigroup is a simple graph whose vertices are the non-zero elements of the semigroup, and two vertices are adjacent if their principal left ideals intersect non-trivially. In this paper, we study the structure of the principal ideal graphs of inverse semigroups, particularly symmetric inverse semigroups. We also introduce the concept of skeletal of a graph and show that the principal ideal graph of an inverse semigroup has a skeletal, which is a simple graph with vertex set as $\mathcal{L}$ classes of non-zero elements. It is also proved that the principal ideal graph of symmetric inverse semigroups has a skeletal which is isomorphic to the intersection graph on the power set of a non-empty set.

Global well-posedness and Gevrey regularity of Navier-Stokes equations in critical Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces
Qixiang Yang, Hongwei Li
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The properties of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations, including well-posedness and Gevrey regularity, are a class of highly interesting problems. Inspired by the property of Lorentz type spaces that they reflect the distribution of large value points, we establish the global well-posedness of Navier-Stokes equations in critical Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz space. Based on this, we obtained the Gevrey regularity of the mild solution. Compared with Germain-Pavlović-Staffilani (2007), the Gevrey regularity we studied is stronger than analyticity. Furthermore, regarding that previous regularity studies mostly focused on Besov spaces, such as Liu-Zhang (2024),our Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces contain more general initial value spaces, including part of Besov spaces and all of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, etc..

Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We return to Takagi's variational principle, generalized after forty years to two complex variables by Pfister. Both isolating some extremal rational functions associated to a bounded holomorphic function in the unit disk, respectively the bidisk. The rational inner functions arising from the Takagi-Pfister skew eigenvectors lead to a Pade type approximation scheme. For these rational functions, we prove a Montessus de Ballore type convergence theorem, on the polydisk in any complex dimension. On the natural and more restrictive class of Agler holomorphic functions with non-negative real part, we show that Cayley rational inner functions match any finite section of the Taylor expansion at a prescribed point. We derive from the Hilbert space proof that the finite section coefficient set of Taylor series of the Agler functions in the Herglotz-Nevanlinna setting is semi-algbraic. The pole distribution of the Takagi-Pfister interpolation sequence is identified as a main open question on the subject.

This paper describes the theory of Jacobi curves, a far reaching extension of the spaces of Jacobi fields along Riemannian geodesics, developed by Agrachev and Zelenko. Jacobi curves are curves in the Lagrangian Grassmannian of a symplectic space satisfying appropriate regularity conditions. It is shown that they are fully characterised in terms of a family of conformal symplectic invariant curvatures. In addition to a new derivation of the Ricci curvature tensor of a Jacobi curve, a Cartan-like theory of Jacobi curves is presented that allows to associate to any admissible Jacobi curve a reduced normal Cartan matrix. A reconstruction theorem proving that an admissible Jacobi curve is characterised, up to conformal symplectic transformations, by a reduced normal Cartan matrix and a geometric parametrization is obtained. The theory of cycles is studied proving that they correspond to flat Jacobi curves.

Spontaneous stochasticity in the Armstrong-Vicol passive scalar

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Spontaneous stochasticity refers to the emergence of intrinsic randomness in deterministic systems under singular limits, a phenomenon conjectured to be fundamental in turbulence. Armstrong and Vicol recently constructed a deterministic, divergence-free multiscale vector field arbitrarily close to a weak Euler solution, proving that a passive scalar transported by this field exhibits anomalous dissipation and lacks a selection principle in the vanishing diffusivity limit. We show that this advection-diffusion PDE also selects a non-Dirac measure in the space of weak solutions in the inviscid limit, thereby exhibiting Eulerian spontaneous stochasticity. We further provide numerical evidence of Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity, together with a numerical illustration of the Obukhov-Corrsin conjecture for this system. We formulate a general framework for spontaneous stochasticity in arbitrary finite dimensional systems under arbitrary regularizations, distinguishing two regimes: weak, where different probability measures may arise along subsequences of inviscid limits, and strong, where the limit measure is unique. The advection diffusion system of Armstrong and Vicol lies in the strong regime. We prove that the set of selected measures is compact and equals the closed convex hull of Dirac measures. Moreover, for any non-Dirac measure supported on the set of nonunique solutions of the inviscid system, there exists a regularization that produces strong spontaneous stochasticity. Finally, we relate this framework to renormalization-group methods à la Feigenbaum and examine how the underlying dynamical system influences the inviscid limit. The discussion is complemented by elementary finite-dimensional examples illustrating a variety of cases.

Central operators on complex Banach lattices
Marcel de Jeu, Xingni Jiang
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Operator Algebras (math.OA)
We show that the centre of a Dedekind complete complex Banach lattice is a commutative $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra in the order unit norm. This implies that the order unit norm and the operator norm coincide. As an application of the latter, a Fuglede--Putnam--Rosenblum-type theorem is established. Under an extra condition on the underlying real Banach lattice, which is satisfied when it is order continuous, a spectral theorem is given for the centre of the complex Banach lattice as a whole and for an individual central operator. The ensuing functional calculus for an individual operator is applied to show that central operators have many spectral properties similar to those of normal operators on complex Hilbert spaces. For example, when the spectrum is countable every element is the sum of an order convergent series of eigenvectors.

We first derive the exponential ergodicity of the stochastic theta method (STM) with $\theta \in (1/2,1]$ for monotone jump-diffusion stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) under a dissipative condition. Then we establish the weak error estimates of the backward Euler method (BEM), corresponding to the STM with $\theta=1$. In particular, the time-independent estimate for the BEM in the jump-free case yields a one-order convergence rate between the exact and numerical invariant measures, answering a question left in {\it Z.

In the 1980s, M. J. Markowitz introduced a conformally invariant pseudodistance on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, inspired by the Kobayashi metric in projective geometry. This construction relies on a distinguished class of parametrized lightlike geodesics, called projectively parametrized. We begin by reviewing the fundamental properties of this pseudodistance and provide several families of examples where it is non-degenerate and, in some cases, complete. In particular, we investigate three classes of manifolds: closed manifolds, conformally convex domains of the Einstein universe, and globally hyperbolic, conformally flat, $C$-maximal spacetimes. For the first two classes, we obtain results analogous to those of Brody and Barth concerning the complex Kobayashi metric. Finally, we apply Markowitz's pseudodistance to classify all quasi-homogeneous domains of the Einstein-de Sitter space, that is, a half-space of Minkowski space bounded by a spacelike hyperplane. Up to conformal transformations, only finitely many such domains exist, and all of them turn out to be homogeneous.

An extended CIR process with stochastic discontinuities

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Finance (q-fin.MF); Pricing of Securities (q-fin.PR)
We study an extension of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process that incorporates jumps at deterministic dates, referred to as stochastic discontinuities. Our main motivation stems from short-rate modelling in the context of overnight rates, which often exhibit jumps at predetermined dates corresponding to central bank meetings. We provide a formal definition of a CIR process with stochastic discontinuities, where the jump sizes depend on the pre-jump state, thereby allowing for both upwarrd and downward movements as well as potential autocorrelation among jumps. Under mild assumptions, we establish existence of such a process and identify sufficient and necessary conditions under which the process inherits the affine property of its continuous counterpart. We illustrate our results with practical examples that generate both upward and downward jumps while preserving the affine property and non-negativity. In particular, we show that a stochastically discontinuous CIR process can be constructed by applying a determinisitic cadlag time-change of a classical CIR process. Finally, we further enrich the affine framework by characterizing conditions that ensure infinite divisibility of the extended CIR process.

Extending edge colorings of distance-2 matchings in the hypercube

Casselgren, Markstörm, and Pham conjectured that any precolored distance-2 matching in the $d$-dimensional cube $Q_d$ can be extended to a proper $d$-edge coloring. In this paper, we prove this conjecture and some related theorems. Especially, our result establishes that if $G$ is a bipartite graph, then a precolored distance-2 matching in the Cartesian product $G \square K_{2m}$ can be extended to an edge coloring using at most $\Delta(G)+1$ colors. As another generalization, we establish the same result for the Cartesian product $G \square K_{1,m}$.

We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which models phase separation in binary fluids, on the two-dimen\-sional torus in the presence of advection by a given background shear flow, satisfying certain conditions and of sufficiently large amplitude. By exploiting the resulting enhanced dissipation for the linearized operator, we prove that, with well-prepared data, the solution converges asymptotically at large times to the solution of a one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation, obtained by projecting the full equation in the direction orthogonal to the shear in a suitable sense. This result rigorously justified the observed phenomenon of striation in the concentration field.

This work analyzes and compares the asymptotic properties of the covariance matrices of vectors of volume power functionals of random Vietoris-Rips complexes, as the intensity of the underlying homogeneous Poisson point process grows. Several key results are established which, in particular, generalize well-known facts on random graphs. Findings regarding rank, definiteness, determinant, eigenspaces, and related decompositions are presented within three distinct regimes. Moreover, we derive stochastic applications of these algebraic properties, leading to interesting results for vectors of volume power functionals.

Bridging Batch and Streaming Estimations to System Identification under Adversarial Attacks

System identification in modern engineering systems faces emerging challenges from unanticipated adversarial attacks beyond existing detection mechanisms. In this work, we obtain a provably accurate estimate of the Markov parameter matrix of order $k$ to identify partially observed linear systems, in which the probability of having an attack at each time is $O(1/k)$. We show that given the batch data accumulated up to time $T^*$, the $\ell_2$-norm estimator achieves an error decaying exponentially as $k$ grows. We then propose a stochastic projected subgradient descent algorithm on streaming data that produces an estimate at each time $t<T^*$, in which case the expected estimation error proves to be the larger of $O(k/\sqrt{t})$ and an exponentially decaying term in $k$. This stochastic approach illustrates how non-smooth estimators can leverage first-order methods despite lacking recursive formulas. Finally, we integrate batch and streaming estimations to recover the Hankel matrix using the appropriate estimates of the Markov parameter matrix, which enables the synthesis of a robust adaptive controller based on the estimated balanced truncated model under adversarial attacks.

Polynomial approximation from diffused data: unisolvence and stability
Ludovico Bruni Bruno, Stefano De Marchi, Giacomo Elefante
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we address the problem of polynomial interpolation of non-pointwise data. More specifically, we assume that our input information comes from measurements obtained on diffuse compact domains. Although the nodal and the diffused problems are related by the mean value theorem, such an approach does not provide any concrete insights in terms of well-posedness and stability. We hence develop a different framework in which {\it unisolvence} can be again recovered from nodal results, for which a wide literature is available. To analyze the stability of the so-obtained diffused interpolation procedure, we characterize the norm of the interpolation operator in terms of a Lebesgue constant-like quantity. After analyzing some of its features, such as invariance properties and sensitivity to support overlapping, we numerically verify the theoretical findings.

Escaping saddle points without Lipschitz smoothness: the power of nonlinear preconditioning

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study generalized smoothness in nonconvex optimization, focusing on $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness and anisotropic smoothness. The former was empirically derived from practical neural network training examples, while the latter arises naturally in the analysis of nonlinearly preconditioned gradient methods. We introduce a new sufficient condition that encompasses both notions, reveals their close connection, and holds in key applications such as phase retrieval and matrix factorization. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we then show that nonlinear preconditioning -- including gradient clipping -- preserves the saddle point avoidance property of classical gradient descent. Crucially, the assumptions required for this analysis are actually satisfied in these applications, unlike in classical results that rely on restrictive Lipschitz smoothness conditions. We further analyze a perturbed variant that efficiently attains second-order stationarity with only logarithmic dependence on dimension, matching similar guarantees of classical gradient methods.

It is known that $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is always a pure sheaf supported either in degree $0$ or in degree $-1$. We prove that the proportion of characters $\chi$ for which $\Psi(\chi^!)$ is supported in degree $0$ is a rational number lying between $0.25$ and $1$, with both bounds being sharp. Moreover, we exhibit families of resolutions for which these proportions attain certain explicit values within this range.

This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing invariants in $G$-equivariant birational geometry by unifying two recent approaches: the \emph{theory of atoms} recently developed by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, and the theory of \emph{modular symbols} due to Kontsevich, Tschinkel, and Pestun.
We initiate the theory of Chen-Ruan atoms. Assuming the blowup formula for the quantum Chen-Ruan cohomology, we outline how to extend the theory of atoms to global quotient orbifolds and present some striking applications.
In addition, we develop a separate class of purely geometric invariants for $\mathbb{Z}/2$- and $\mathbb{Z}/3$-actions on surfaces and threefolds.
We provide many examples of non-$G$-linearizable $G$-actions on projective varieties treated with these new techniques.

Group Theory (math.GR)
We revisit the structure of the normalizer $N_W(P)$ of a parabolic subgroup $P$ in a finite Coxeter group $W$, originally described by Howlett. Building on Howlett's Lemma, which provides canonical complements for reflection subgroups, and inspired by a recent construction of Serre for involution centralizers, we refine this understanding by interpreting $N_W(P)$ as a subdirect product via Goursat's Lemma. Central to our approach is a Galois connection on the lattice of parabolic subgroups, which leads to a new decomposition \begin{align*} N_W(P) \cong (P \times Q) \rtimes ((A \times B) \rtimes C)\text, \end{align*} where each subgroup reflects a structural feature of the ambient Coxeter system. This perspective yields a more symmetric description of $N_W(P)$, organized around naturally associated reflection subgroups on mutually orthogonal subspaces of the reflection representation of $W$. Our analysis provides new conceptual clarity and includes a case-by-case classification for all irreducible finite Coxeter groups.

Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Projective geodesic extensions are reparametrizations of the trajectories of a nonholonomic mechanical system (with only a kinetic energy Lagrangian), in such a way that they can be interpreted as part of the geodesics of a Riemannian metric. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these extensions, in the case where the constrained Lagrangian remains preserved up to a conformal transformation. When the nonholonomic system has a symmetry group (a Chaplygin system), we clarify the relation between projective geodesic extensions and closely related concepts, such as ${\phi}$-simplicity, invariant measures and Hamiltonization. Throughout the paper, new and relevant examples illustrate the key differences between all these concepts.

Improper coloring of toroidal graphs

A graph $G$ is called $(d_1,\dots,d_k)$-colorable if its vertices can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1,\dots,V_k$ such that $\Delta(\langle V_i\rangle_G)\leq d_i, i\in \{1,\dots, k\}$. If $d_1 = \dots = d_k = m$ we say that $G$ is $k$-colorable with defect $m$. A coloring with at least one $d_i, i\in \{1,\dots, k\}$, greater than $0$ is called an improper coloring. It is known that toroidal graphs are properly $7$-colorable, therefore they are $7$-colorable with defect $0$. It was also proved that toroidal graphs are $5$-colorable with defect $1$ and $3$-colorable with defect $2$. The question whether they are $4$-colorable with defect $1$ remains open.
In this paper we focus on improper coloring of toroidal graphs with values of defects being not all equal. We prove that these graphs are $(0,0,0,0,0,1^*)$-colorable, $(0,0,0,0,2)$-colorable and $(0,0,0,1^*,1^*)$-colorable (a star means that there is an improper coloring in which subgraph induced by the corresponding color class contains at most one edge). Choi and Esperet in [Improper coloring of graphs on surfaces, J. Graph Theory $91(1)\,(2019), 16-34$] proved that every graph of Euler genus $eg > 0$ is $(0, 0, 0, 9eg - 4)$-colorable. From this result it follows that toroidal graphs are $(0,0,0,14)$-colorable. We decreased the value $14$ and proved that toroidal graphs are $(0,0,0,4)$-colorable.
We also show that all 6-regular toroidal graphs except $K_7$ and $T_{11}$ are $(0,0,0,1)$-colorable. Finally, we discuss the colorability of graphs embeddable on $N_1$ and show that they are $(0,0,0,2)$-colorable.

The inverse of the star discrepancy of a union of randomly digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets depends polynomially on the dimension
Josef Dick, Friedrich Pillichshammer
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Number Theory (math.NT)
The star discrepancy is a quantitative measure of the uniformity of a point set in the unit cube. A central quantity of interest is the inverse of the star discrepancy, $N(\varepsilon, s)$, defined as the minimum number of points required to achieve a star discrepancy of at most~$\varepsilon$ in dimension~$s$. It is known that $N(\varepsilon, s)$ depends only linearly on the dimension~$s$. All known proofs of this result are non-constructive. Finding explicit point set constructions that achieve this optimal linear dependence on the dimension remains a major open problem.
In this paper, we make progress on this question by analyzing point sets constructed from a multiset union of digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets. Specifically, we show the following two results. A union of randomly generated Korobov polynomial lattice point sets shifted by a random digital shift of depth $m$ can achieve a star discrepancy whose inverse depends only linearly on $s$. The second result shows that a union of all Korobov polynomial lattice point sets, each shifted by a different random digital shift, achieves the same star discrepancy bound. While our proof relies on a concentration result (Bennett's inequality) and is therefore non-constructive, it significantly reduces the search space for such point sets from a continuum of possibilities to a finite set of candidates, marking a step towards a fully explicit construction.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Consider an inverse problem of the simultaneous recovery of boundary impedance and internal conductivity in the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) model using local internal measurement data, which is governed by a boundary value problem for an elliptic equation in divergence form with Robin boundary condition. We firstly express the solution to the forward problem by volume and surface potentials in terms of the Levi function. Then, for the inverse problem, we prove the uniqueness of the solution in an admissible set by unique extension of the solution under some {a-prior} assumption. Finally we establish the regularizing reconstruction schemes for boundary impedance and internal conductivity using noisy measurement data with rigorous error estimates. The mollification method is proposed to recover the boundary impedance from the boundary condition, and the internal conductivity with known boundary value is recovered from an integral system, where the Tikhonov regularization is applied to seek the stable solution, considering that the error involved in the boundary impedance coefficient reconstruction will propagate to the recovering process for internal conductivity. Numerical implementations are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.

A Multidimensional Self-Adaptive Numerical Simulation Framework for Semiconductor Boltzmann Transport Equation

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This research addresses the numerical simulation of the Boltzmann transport equation for semiconductor devices by proposing a multidimensional self-adaptive numerical simulation framework. This framework is applied to two important generalized forms of the equation: a parabolic equation with singular properties on the unit disk and a continuity equation. The study enhances the alignment of numerical simulations with physical characteristics through polar coordinate transformation and variable drift-diffusion coefficients. Innovatively, a multidimensional adaptive mesh partitioning strategy for radius-angle-time is designed and combined with an adjustable finite difference scheme to construct a highly adaptive numerical simulation method. In the construction of discrete schemes, the Swartztrauber-Sweet method and the control volume method are employed to effectively eliminate the origin singularity caused by polar coordinate transformation. On the programming front, a parallelized MATLAB algorithm is developed to optimize code execution efficiency. Numerical comparative experiments demonstrate that the adaptive method improves the accuracy of the parabolic equation by 1 to 7 times and that of the continuity equation by 10% to 70% while maintaining computational efficiency, significantly enhancing numerical simulation accuracy with high stability. Furthermore, this study systematically verifies the algorithm's convergence, stability, and parameter sensitivity using error visualization and other means. It also explores optimal parameters and establishes tuning optimization criteria. The research provides theoretical support for high-precision and highly adaptive methods in semiconductor device simulation, demonstrating outstanding advantages in handling singular regions.

On traveling wave solutions of water-wave equations in curved annular domains
Liang Li, Quan Wang
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper presents a pioneering investigation into the existence of traveling wave solutions for the two-dimensional Euler equations with constant vorticity in a curved annular domain, where gravity acts radially inward. This configuration is highly relevant to astrophysical and equatorial oceanic flows, such as those found in planetary rings and equatorial currents. Unlike traditional water wave models that assume flat beds and vertical gravity, our study more accurately captures the centripetal effects and boundary-driven vorticity inherent in these complex systems.
Our main results establish both local and global bifurcation of traveling waves, marking a significant advancement in the field. First, through a local bifurcation analysis near a trivial solution, we identify a critical parameter \(\alpha_c\) and prove the existence of a smooth branch of small-amplitude solutions. The bifurcation is shown to be pitchfork-type, with its direction (subcritical or supercritical) determined by the sign of an explicit parameter \(\mathcal{O}\). This finding provides a nuanced understanding of the wave behavior under varying conditions. Second, we obtain a global bifurcation result using a modified Leray-Schauder degree theory. This result demonstrates that the local branch extends to large-amplitude waves. This comprehensive analysis offers a holistic view of the traveling wave solutions in this complex domain. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the theoretical bifurcation types, confirming both supercritical and subcritical regimes. These examples highlight the practical applicability of our results.

An optimal-control framework for reaction diffusion systems with application to synthetic developmental biology

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Reaction-diffusion systems offer a powerful framework for understanding self-organized patterns in biological systems, yet controlling these patterns remains a significant challenge. As a consequence, we present a rigorous framework of optimal control for a class of coupled reaction-diffusion systems. The couplings are justified by the shared regulatory mechanisms encountered in synthetic biology. Furthermore, we introduce inputs and polynomial input-gain functions to guarantee well-posedness of the control system while maintaining biological relevance. As a result, we formulate an optimal control problem and derive necessary optimality conditions. We demonstrate our framework on an instance of such equations modeling the Nodal-Lefty interactions in mammalian cells. Numerical simulations showcase the effectiveness in directing pattern towards diverse targeted ones.

Regularity properties of distributions of correspondences without countable generation: applications to large games
Motoki Otsuka
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Theoretical Economics (econ.TH); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We show that each of the regularity properties of regular conditional distributions of correspondences (convexity, closedness, compactness, and preservation of closed graphs) is equivalent to the condition of nowhere equivalence. This result does not require any countable-generation assumptions. As an application, we establish the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium for large games with general trait spaces. The trait space may be an arbitrary measurable space. As a corollary, we obtain the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in semi-anonymous settings in which payoffs depend, in addition to agents' own actions, on the joint distribution over the space of agents and actions.

A Flow-rate-conserving CNN-based Domain Decomposition Method for Blood Flow Simulations

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
This work aims to predict blood flow with non-Newtonian viscosity in stenosed arteries using convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate models. An alternating Schwarz domain decomposition method is proposed which uses CNN-based subdomain solvers. A universal subdomain solver (USDS) is trained on a single, fixed geometry and then applied for each subdomain solve in the Schwarz method. Results for two-dimensional stenotic arteries of varying shape and length for different inflow conditions are presented and statistically evaluated. One key finding, when using a limited amount of training data, is the need to implement a USDS which preserves some of the physics, as, in our case, flow rate conservation. A physics-aware approach outperforms purely data-driven USDS, delivering improved subdomain solutions and preventing overshooting or undershooting of the global solution during the Schwarz iterations, thereby leading to more reliable convergence.

Facial nested complexes and acyclonestohedra
Chiara Mantovani, Arnau Padrol, Vincent Pilaud
Comments:
61 pages, 23 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study nested complexes of building sets on the Las Vergnas face lattices of oriented matroids. Such a nested complex is the face lattice of an oriented matroid, obtained by iterated stellar subdivisions of the positive tope. If the oriented matroid is realizable, the nested complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of a polytope.
We turn this into an explicit and combinatorially meaningful polytopal realization. We prove that the facial nested complex can be embedded as the acyclic subcomplex of the nested complex of a well-chosen boolean building set. In the realizable case, we show that this acyclic subcomplex can be geometrically selected as the section of a nestohedron by the evaluation space of the vector configuration, which we call acyclonestohedron.
Our framework generalizes the poset associahedra recently introduced by P. Galashin, from order polytopes to any polytope. Poset associahedra are the graphical acyclonestohedra, and our approach recovers as particular cases the main results of P. Galashin and answers some of his open questions. Besides poset associahedra, our framework unifies various other existing families of nested-like polytopes, such as the simple polytope nestohedra, the hyperoctahedral nestohedra, the design graph associahedra and the permutopermutohedra, to which our palette of results can be directly applied.
The core of our construction is the embedding of the facial nested complex inside a boolean nested complex. More generally, we provide conditions that guarantee an embedding between nested complexes over two lattices. For instance, any atomic nested complex has a canonical embedding inside a boolean nested complex. As another application, we embed nested complexes over lattices of faces into nested complexes over lattices of flats, recovering as a particular case, the embedding of the positive Bergman complex into the Bergman complex.

Analytic Bernoulli Functions: Correspondence with Hermite Polynomials
Ken Nagai
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We establish an operator--theoretic correspondence between periodic Bernoulli kernels and Hermite polynomials, framed through the umbral calculus and a quantum analogy. Starting from the analytic master function $F^\ast$, the periodic Hilbert transform appears as a $\pi/2$ symplectic rotation, while Jacobi matrices reproduce the oscillator ladder. Umbral operational rules extend this structure across complex order, and Weyl algebra lifting together with the Weil representation explains the shared spectrum of Bernoulli and Hermite families. Analytically, this chain connects Clausen functions to Bernoulli kernels, to polylogarithms, to the Hurwitz zeta function, and ultimately to the Lerch transcendent, embedding the umbral framework into the classical landscape of special functions. This perspective clarifies why odd zeta values arise in Bernoulli integrals and unifies trigonometric and Gaussian worlds within a coherent operator framework.

Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $d$ over an algebraically closed field $k$. The main goal of this paper is to study, in the context of Voevodsky's triangulated category of motives $DM_k$, the group $CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)$ of codimension $n$ algebraic cycles of $X$, algebraically equivalent to zero, modulo rational equivalence, $1\leq n \leq d$. Namely, for any regular homomorphism $\psi$ (in the sense of Samuel) defined on $CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)$, we construct $M^n_{\psi}(X)\in DM_k$, which is a reasonable approximation, with respect to the slice filtration in $DM_k$, of the motive of $X$, $M(X)$; and a map $z_\psi : M^n_{\psi}(X)\rightarrow M(X)$ in $DM_k$, which computes the kernel of $\psi$. We construct as well a map, $z_{\mathrm{ab}}^n: M^n_{\mathrm{ab}}(X) \rightarrow M(X)$ having analogue properties but which instead computes the subgroup $CH^n_{\mathrm{ab}}(X)\subseteq CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)$ of algebraic cycles abelian equivalent to zero (in the sense of Samuel).

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this manuscript, we study modified scattering for the nonlinear defocusing Schrödinger equation with a critical gauge-invariant nonlinearity of order 1+2/n.
We address the following question: Given initial data in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, what is the leading term in the asymptotic behavior of the solution as times goes to infinity? More precisely, we seek a final state in a space of type similar to the space of the initial data such that the leading term is represented by the free propagator and modified phase function.
The solution to this problem can be reformulated in terms of the completeness of wave operators. For n=1, we obtain a complete answer, even for large initial data. For n = 2 completeness is established assuming suitable control of the sup norm of the solution.

Uniqueness of inverse random source problems for stochastic heat and wave equations
Xu Wang, Guanlin Yang, Zhidong Zhang
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Probability (math.PR)
This paper investigates an inverse random source problem for stochastic evolution equations, including stochastic heat and wave equations, with the unknown source modeled as $g(x)f(t)\dot{W}(t)$. The research commences with the establishment of the well-posedness of the corresponding stochastic direct problem. Under suitable regularity conditions, the existence of stochastic strong solutions for both the stochastic heat and wave equations is demonstrated. For the inverse problem, the objective is to uniquely recover the strength $|f(t)|$ of the time-dependent component of the source from the boundary flux on a nonempty open subset. The uniqueness of the recovery for both the stochastic heat and wave equations is proven, and several numerical examples are given to verify the theoretical results.

Computing the Zeros of a Holomorphic Function Using Quadrature-Based Subdivision and Rational Approximation of the Logarithmic Derivative
Jake Bowhay, Yuji Nakatsukasa, Irwin Zaid
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce a new method that uses AAA approximation to reliably compute all the zeros of a holomorphic function in a specified search region in the complex plane. Specifically, the method is based on rational approximation of the logarithmic derivative in combination with subdivision of the search region based on Cauchy's argument principle. This is motivated by the fact that, while it is straightforward to compute the zeros of a AAA rational approximation, there is no guarantee that all of the zeros of the function being approximated in the region being approximated will be found. Many of the ideas presented are also applicable to computing both the zeros and the poles of a meromorphic function. A implementation of the method is provided by the Python package skzeros.

Enforcing Convergence in Sensitivity-based Distributed Programming via Transformed Primal-Dual Updates
Maximilian Pierer von Esch, Andreas Völz, Knut Graichen
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Sensitivity-based distributed programming (SBDP) is an algorithm for solving large-scale, nonlinear programs over graph-structured networks. However, its convergence depends on the coupling strength and structure between subsystems. To address this limitation, we develop an algorithmic variant: SBDP+. The proposed method utilizes first-order sensitivities and primal decomposition to formulate low-dimensional, decoupled subproblems, which are solved in parallel with neighbor-to-neighbor communication. SBDP+ differs from SBDP by enforcing convergence for all coupling structures through a carefully designed primal-dual update. It retains a low communication effort and handles couplings in the objective and constraints. We establish sufficient conditions for local convergence in the non-convex case. The effectiveness of the method is shown by solving various distributed optimization problems, including statistical learning, with a comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Going with the Flow: Solving for Symmetry-Driven PDE dynamics with Physics-informed Neural Networks

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In the past, we have presented a systematic computational framework for analyzing self-similar and traveling wave dynamics in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by dynamically factoring out continuous symmetries such as translation and scaling. This is achieved through the use of time-dependent transformations -- what can be viewed as dynamic pinning conditions -- that render the symmetry-invariant solution stationary or slowly varying in rescaled coordinates. The transformation process yields a modified evolution equation coupled with algebraic constraints on the symmetry parameters, resulting in index-2 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The framework accommodates both first-kind and second-kind self-similarity, and directly recovers the self-similarity exponents or wave speeds as part of the solution, upon considering steady-state solutions in the rescaled coordinate frame. To solve the resulting high-index DAE systems, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which naturally integrate PDE residuals and algebraic constraints into a unified loss function. This allows simultaneous inference of both the invariant solution and the transformation properties (such as the speed or the scaling rate without the need for large computational domains, mesh adaptivity, or front tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on four canonical problems: (i) the Nagumo equation exhibiting traveling waves, (ii) the diffusion equation (1D and 2D) with first-kind self-similarity, (iii) the 2D axisymmetric porous medium equation showcasing second-kind self-similarity, and (iv) the Burgers equation, which involves both translational and scaling invariance. The results demonstrate the capability of PINNs to effectively solve these complex PDE-DAE systems, providing a promising tool for studying nonlinear wave and scaling phenomena.

In Ratio Section Method and Algorithms for Minimizing Unimodal Functions
Vladimir Kodnyanko
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper proposes a new method for section an interval in a given ratio intended for minimizing unimodal functions. The ratio section search is capable of quickly recognizing monotone functions and functions with a flat bottom, which contributes to increasing its performance, as measured by the number of minimized function evaluations. The method is implemented as passive and active algorithms. A comparison of the performance of the developed method with that of the classical methods of bisection search and the golden section search was performed on the basis of the data used to minimize twenty unimodal functions of various types. For all types of functions, the passive algorithm is 2.26 times faster than the bisection search and 1.72 times faster than the golden section method. Thus, the proposed method turned out to be the fastest of the known methods of cutting off segments intended for minimizing unimodal functions. The active algorithm is faster: for all types of functions, these indicators are 3.31 and 2.52, respectively. The fastest combined Brent method was also modernized. After the golden section procedure is replaced with a procedure for dividing a segment in a given ratio, a numerical experiment is conducted. The modernized method is 1.69 times faster than its prototype. Moreover, the performance of the active algorithm for dividing a segment at a given ratio exceeds that of the Brent method by 1.48 times for all types of functions. The modernized Brent method is approximately 4 times faster than the bisection search and 3 times faster than the golden section method.

Optimization and Control (math.OC); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded open planar domain with smooth connected boundary, $\Gamma$, that has been partitioned into two disjoint components, $\Gamma = \Gamma_S \sqcup \Gamma_N$. We consider the Steklov-Neumann eigenproblem on $\Omega$, where a harmonic function is sought that satisfies the Steklov boundary condition on $\Gamma_S$ and the Neumann boundary condition on $\Gamma_N$. We pose the extremal eigenvalue problems (EEPs) of minimizing/maximizing the $k$-th non-trivial Steklov-Neumann eigenvalue among boundary partitions of prescribed measure. We formulate a relaxation of these EEPs in terms of weighted Steklov eigenvalues where an $L^\infty(\Gamma)$ density replaces the boundary partition. For these relaxed EEPs, we establish existence, prove optimality conditions, show that the maximization problem is convex for $k=1$ and non-convex for $k\geq 2$, and establish symmetry properties for the maximizing densities for $k=1$. We also prove a homogenization result that allows us to use solutions to the relaxed EEPs to infer properties of solutions to the original EEPs. For a disk, we provide numerical and asymptotic evidence that the minimizing arrangement of $\Gamma_S\sqcup \Gamma_N$ for the $k$-th eigenvalue consists of $k+1$ connected components that are symmetrically arranged on the boundary. For a disk, we prove that for $k = 1$, the constant density is a maximizer for the relaxed problem; we also provide numerical and asymptotic evidence that for $k\ge 2$, the maximizing density for the relaxed problem is a non-trivial function; a sequence of rapidly oscillating Steklov/Neumann boundary conditions approach the supremum value.

An Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting (IETI) method for solving high order partial differential equations over planar multi-patch geometries

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a novel method for solving high-order partial differential equations (PDEs) over planar multi-patch geometries demonstrated on the basis of the polyharmonic equation of order $m$, $m \geq 1$, which is a particular linear elliptic PDE of order $2m$. Our approach is based on the concept of Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting (IETI) [43] and allows to couple the numerical solution of the PDE with $C^s$-smoothness, $s \geq m-1$, across the edges of the multi-patch geometry. The proposed technique relies on the use of a particular class of multi-patch geometries, called bilinear-like $G^s$ multi-patch parameterizations [37], to represent the multi-patch domain. The coupling between the neighboring patches is done via the use of Lagrange multipliers and leads to a saddle point problem, which can be solved efficiently first by a small dual problem for a subset of the Lagrange multipliers followed by local, parallelizable problems on the single patches for the coefficients of the numerical solution. Several numerical examples of solving the polyharmonic equation of order $m=2$ and $m=3$, i.e. the biharmonic and triharmonic equation, respectively, over different multi-patch geometries are shown to demonstrate the potential of our IETI method for high-order problems.

Interval Estimation for Bounded Jacobian Nonlinear Systems by Zonotope Analysis

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper introduces an interval state estimation method for discrete-time bounded Jacobian nonlinear systems allying Luenberger-like observer with zonotope set computation. First, a robust observer is designed to obtain bounded-error and point-estimation with a peak-to-peak performance. This allows one to cope with the unknown but bounded process disturbance and measurement noise. Then, based on the stable dynamics of the observation error, tight interval estimation is obtained by applying zonotope set computation and analysis. To sum up, a comprehensive interval estimation algorithm is proposed by integrating the robust (in the sense of peak-to-peak performance index) point-valued estimate with the feasible zonotope set of the estimation error. Numerical simulation tests are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We establish new results for path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations with nonlinear monotone, and coercive operators on Hilbert space, which were initially studied in Bayraktar and Keller [J. Funct. Anal., 275 (8) (2018), pp. 2096-2161]. Under more general assumptions than in the cited paper (and more general than in the finite-dimensional case as well), we prove the uniqueness of a minimax solution of a terminal-value problem for the equation under consideration and the existence of such a solution on the whole path space. We introduce a new notion of a viscosity solution for this problem and show the equivalence of this notion to the notion of a minimax solution, which implies the corresponding existence and uniqueness theorem for viscosity solutions. In addition, we obtain a stability result for viscosity solutions using the half-relaxed limits method. As applications, we prove two theorems on the existence and characterization of value of a zero-sum differential game for a time-delay (path-dependent) evolution equation. The first theorem pertains to the case of non-anticipative (Elliott-Kalton) strategies and is related to the results on viscosity solutions, and the second theorem deals with the case of feedback (Krasovskii-Subbotin) strategies and is based on the results on minimax solutions.

Solvability Complexity Index Classification For Koopman Operator Spectra In $L^p$ For $1<p<\infty$

We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1<p<\infty$ and a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index, of how many limiting procedures are inherently necessary. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case.
The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.

Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method with Upper and Lower Bound Constraints
Louisa B. Ebby, Mohammad Farazmand
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) is a simple and effective method for reconstructing a function from its incomplete pointwise observations. However, applying DEIM to functions with physically constrained ranges can produce reconstructions with values outside the prescribed physical bounds. Such physically constrained quantities occur routinely in applications, e.g., mass density whose range is nonnegative. The DEIM reconstructions which violate these physical constraints are not usable in downstream tasks such as forecasting and control. To address this issue, we develop Constrained DEIM (C-DEIM) whose reconstructions are guaranteed to respect the physical bounds of the quantity of interest. C-DEIM enforces the bounds as soft constraints, in the form of a carefully designed penalty term, added to the underlying least squares problem. We prove that the C-DEIM reconstructions satisfy the physical constraints asymptotically, i.e., as the penalty parameter increases towards infinity. We also derive a quantitative upper bound for the observation residual of C-DEIM. Based on these theoretical results, we devise an efficient algorithm for practical implementation of C-DEIM. The efficacy of the method and the accompanying algorithm are demonstrated on several examples, including a heat transfer problem from fluid dynamics and a cellular automaton model of wildfire spread.

One can estimate the change of the Perron and Fiedler values for a connected network when the weight of an edge is perturbed by analyzing relevant entries of the Perron and Fiedler vectors. This is helpful for identifying edges whose weight perturbation causes the largest change in the Perron and Fiedler values. It also is important to investigate the sensitivity of the Perron and Fiedler vectors to perturbations. Applications of the perturbation analysis include the identification of edges that are critical for the structural robustness of the network.

Letting $w$ denote a finite, nonempty word, let $\text{red}(w)$ denote the word obtained from $w$ by replacing every subword $s$ of $w$ of the form $cc \cdots c$ for a given character $c$ (such that there is no character immediately to the left or right of $s$ equal to $c$) with $c$. Complexity functions for infinite words play important roles within combinatorics on words, and this leads us to introduce and investigate variants of the factor and abelian complexity functions using the given reduction operation. By enumerating words $v$ and $w$ of a given length $n \geq 0$ and associated with an infinite sequence over a finite alphabet such that $\text{red}(v)$ and $\text{red}(w)$ are equal or otherwise equivalent in some specified way, by analogy with the factor and abelian complexity functions, this may be seen as producing simplified versions of previously introduced complexity functions. We prove a recursion for the reduced factor complexity function $\rho_{\mathbf{t}}^{\text{red}}$ for the Thue-Morse sequence $\mathbf{t}$, giving us that $(\rho_{\mathbf{t}}^{\text{red}}(n) : n \in \mathbb{N})$ is a $2$-regular sequence, we prove an explicit evaluation for the reduced factor complexity function $\rho_{\mathbf{f}}^{\text{red}}$ for the (regular) paperfolding sequence $\mathbf{f}$, together with an evaluation for the reduced abelian complexity function $\rho_{\mathbf{f}}^{\text{ab}, \text{red}}$ for $\mathbf{f}$. We conclude with open problems concerning $\rho_{\mathbf{t}}^{\text{ab}, \text{red}}$.

Title:
Near-Field Beam Training Through Beam Diverging
Ran Li, Ziyi Xu, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
This paper investigates beam training techniques for near-field (NF) extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs). Existing NF beam training methods predominantly rely on beam focusing, where the base station (BS) transmits highly spatially selective beams to locate the user equipment (UE). However, these beam-focusing-based schemes suffer from both high beam sweeping overhead and limited accuracy in the NF, primarily due to the narrow beams' high susceptibility to misalignment. To address this, we propose a novel NF beam training paradigm using diverging beams. Specifically, we introduce the beam diverging effect and exploit it for low-overhead, high-accuracy beam training. First, we design a diverging codeword to induce the beam diverging effect with a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Next, we develop a diverging polar-domain codebook (DPC) along with a hierarchical method that enables angular-domain localization of the UE with only 2 log_2(N) pilots, where N denotes the number of antennas. Finally, we enhance beam training performance through two additional techniques: a DPC angular range reduction strategy to improve the effectiveness of beam diverging, and a pilot set expansion method to increase overall beam training accuracy. Numerical results show that our algorithm achieves near-optimal accuracy with a small pilot overhead, outperforming existing methods.

A Note on the formulation of the Neumann boundary condition for a nonlocal problem
Antonio Luiz Pereira

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
The nonlocal diffusion equation with continuous kernel $K(x,y$, with $ \int_{R} K(y,x) \, d \, y = 1$
has been proposed as a model for some evolution process with diffusion, including population models. However, in general, we don't have $ \int_{\Omega} K(y,x) \, d \, y = 1$, as expected from its interpretation as a probability density.
In this note, we propose a modification of the kernel, based on the idea of `reflection' at the boundary, familiar in one dimensional problems. We show that a similar construction is possible in higher dimensions, with the new kernel satisfying the above integral equality and being also symmetric in some special cases.

We study the Brauer groups of affine surfaces that are complements of singular hyperplane sections of smooth cubic surfaces over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$. We determine the Brauer group over the algebraic closure as a Galois module for all the possible singular hyperplane sections. For the case when the hyperplane section is geometrically the union of three lines and $k=\mathbb{Q}$, we give examples where the Galois invariant part descends to $\mathbb{Q}$.

We study the Brauer groups of regular conic bundles over elliptic curves defined over a number field $k$. We explicitly compute the Brauer group of the conic bundle when the singular fibres lie above $k$-points that are divisible by $2$ in $E(k)$, and the corresponding ramification fields are isomorphic. We apply the result to compute the Brauer group of a class of surfaces analogous to that of Châtelet surfaces. We investigate Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation coming from the real places on such surfaces.

3D Near-Field Beam Training for Uniform Planar Arrays through Beam Diverging
Ran Li, Ziyi Xu, Ying-Jun Angela Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In future 6G communication systems, large-scale antenna arrays promise enhanced signal strength and spatial resolution, but they also increase the complexity of beam training. Moreover, as antenna counts grow and carrier wavelengths shrink, the channel model transits from far-field (FF) planar waves to near-field (NF) spherical waves, further complicating the beam training process. This paper focuses on millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems equipped with large-scale uniform planar arrays (UPAs), which produce 3D beam patterns and introduce additional challenges for NF beam training. Existing methods primarily rely on either FF steering or NF focusing codewords, both of which are highly sensitive to mismatches in user equipment (UE) location, leading to high sensitivity to even slight mismatch and excessive training overhead. In contrast, we introduce a novel beam training approach leveraging the beam-diverging effect, which enables adjustable wide-beam coverage using only a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Specifically, we first analyze the spatial characteristics of this effect in UPA systems and leverage them to construct hierarchical codebooks for coarse UE localization. Then, we develop a 3D sampling mechanism to build an NF refinement codebook for precise beam training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior beam training performance while maintaining low training overhead.

Mayer--Vietoris sequences for complexes of tori
Nguyen Manh Linh
Comments:
27 pages
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In the patching setting, given a factorization inverse system of fields over which patching for finite-dimensional vector spaces holds, together with a crossed module over the inverse limit field, the corresponding six-term Mayer--Vietoris sequence is constructed, generalizing the classical result of Harbater--Hartmann--Krashen for linear algebraic groups. When the crossed module is a two-term complex of tori, the above sequence is extended into a nine-term exact sequence, notably without any assumption on global domination of Galois cohomology of the inverse system. To this end, we develop a theory of (co-)flasque resolutions for short complexes of tori which is built on the work of Colliot-Thélène and Sansuc. As an application, we show that patching holds for nonabelian second Galois cohomology of reductive groups with smooth centers. We also obtain a weak local--global principle for this cohomology set in the simply connected semisimple case.

Spin(7)-Orbifold Resolutions
Viktor F. Majewski
Subjects:

We establish a general analytic and geometric framework for resolving Spin(7)--orbifolds. These spaces arise naturally as boundary points in the moduli space of exceptional holonomy metrics, and smooth Gromov--Hausdorff resolutions can be viewed as paths from the boundary to the interior of the moduli space. Our construction combines algebraic and symplectic techniques with analytic gluing methods: singular strata are replaced by families of adiabatic torsion--free, asymptotically conical fibred spaces, whose existence is controlled by the analysis of Dirac--type operators on orbifold resolutions. We formulate obstruction conditions in terms of string cohomology, prove existence results for torsion--free Spin(7)--structures extending Joyce's theorem arXiv:math/9910002 to the setting of orbifold resolutions, and construct new families of compact Spin(7)--manifolds. By dimensional reduction, our results also recover, generalise and extend the results of Joyce and Karigiannis arXiv:1707.09325 on $G_2$--orbifold resolutions. This unifies and extends all known resolution methods for exceptional holonomy orbifolds.

The structure groups and monoids of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation can be regarded as deformations of free abelian groups resp. monoids. In this work, we obtain explicit formulae for the growth series of the structure groups and monoids of transposition and dihedral quandles, and of the structure groups of permutation quandles. These quandles provide important families of YBE solutions. The intricate nature of our formulae confirms that, while preserving many nice properties of free abelian groups, even the simplest structure groups and monoids are remarkably rich objects. We also establish some structural properties and easily computable normal forms for the monoids considered.

In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the solution of the classical problem of finding the distribution density of a random variable - the first passage time to a given domain by the trajectory of a $p$-adic Markov stochastic process with probability density function satisfying the solution of the Cauchy problem for the Vladimirov equation (a $p$-adic analog of the Kolmogorov-Feller equation with the kernel of the Vladimirov operator) with uniform initial distribution in the unit ball. We consider three equivalent approaches to obtain equations for the distribution density of a random variable - the first passage time to a given domain by a stochastic trajectory. We find a solution to these equations for the distribution density, analyze its properties, and compare them with the properties of the distribution density of a random variable - the first return timeof a stochastic trajectory to the support of the initial distribution. We also solve the problem of finding the number of hittings a given domain and analyze the solution obtained. In conclusion, we discuss a class of problems related to the study of the distribution density of the passage time to a given domain and the return time to the initial domain for other types of $p$-adic Markov stochastic processes.

On separating sets of polynomial invariants of finite abelian group actions

Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Number Theory (math.NT)
Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a finite dimensional complex vector space $V$ via linear transformations. Let $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ be the algebra of polynomials that are invariant under the induced $G$-action on the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[V]$. A subset $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}[V]^G$ is a separating set if it separates the orbits of the group action. If $G$ is abelian, then there exist finite separating sets consisting of monomials. In this paper we investigate properties of separating sets from four different points of view, including the monoid theoretical properties of separating sets consisting of monomials, the minimal size of separating sets consisting of monomials, the exact value of the separating Noether number $\sepbeta(G)$ of abelian groups of rank $4$, and the inverse problem of $\sepbeta(G)$ for abelian groups of rank $2$.

Geodesic clustering of zeros of Eisenstein series for congruence groups
Sebastián Carrillo Santana, Gunther Cornelissen, Berend Ringeling
Comments:
65 pages (a4paper, fullpaper), 15 figures
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We consider a set of generators for the space of Eisenstein series of even weight $k$ for any congruence group $\Gamma$ and study the set of all of their zeros taken for $\Gamma(1)$-conjugates of $\Gamma$ in the standard fundamental domain for $\Gamma(1)$. We describe (a) an upper bound $\kappa_\Gamma + O(1/k)$ for their imaginary part; (b) a finite configuration of geodesics segments to which all zeros converge in Hausdorff distance as $k \rightarrow \infty$; (c) a finite set containing all algebraic zeros for all weights. The bound in (a) depends on the (non-)vanishing of a new generalization of Ramanujan sums. The proof of (b) originates in a method used to study phase transitions in statistical physics. The proof of (c) relies on the theory of complex multiplication. The results can be made quantitative for specific groups. For $\Gamma=\Gamma(N)$ with $4 \nmid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=1$ and the zeros tend to the unit circle, whereas if $4 \mid N$, $\kappa_\Gamma=2$ and the limit configuration includes parts of vertical geodesics and circles of radius $2$. In both cases, the only algebraic zeros are at $\mathrm{i}$ and $\exp(2\pi \mathrm{i}/3)$ for sufficiently large $k$. For $\Gamma(N)$ with $N$ odd, we use finer estimates to prove a trichotomy for the exact `convergence speed' of the zeros to the unit circle, as well as angular equidistribution of the zeros as $k \rightarrow \infty$.

A generalized canonical metric for optimization on the indefinite Stiefel manifold

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Various tasks in scientific computing can be modeled as an optimization problem on the indefinite Stiefel manifold. We address this using the Riemannian approach, which basically consists of equipping the feasible set with a Riemannian metric, preparing geometric tools such as orthogonal projections, formulae for Riemannian gradient, retraction and then extending an unconstrained optimization algorithm on the Euclidean space to the established manifold. The choice for the metric undoubtedly has a great influence on the method. In the previous work [D.V. Tiep and N.T. Son, A Riemannian gradient descent method for optimization on the indefinite Stiefel manifold, arXiv:2410.22068v2[math.OC]], a tractable metric, which is indeed a family of Riemannian metrics defined by a symmetric positive-definite matrix depending on the contact point, has been used. In general, it requires solving a Lyapunov matrix equation every time when the gradient of the cost function is needed, which might significantly contribute to the computational cost. To address this issue, we propose a new Riemannian metric for the indefinite Stiefel manifold. Furthermore, we construct the associated geometric structure, including a so-called quasi-geodesic and propose a retraction based on this curve. We then numerically verify the performance of the Riemannian gradient descent method associated with the new geometry and compare it with the previous work.

Mixing properties of some Markov chains models in random environments
Attila Lovas, Lionel Truquet
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Markov chains in random environments (MCREs) have recently attracted renewed interest, as these processes naturally arise in many applications, such as econometrics and machine learning. Although specific asymptotic results, such as the law of the large numbers and central limit theorems, have been obtained for some of these models, their annealed dependence properties, such as strong mixing properties, are not well understood in general. We derive strong mixing properties for a wide range of MCREs that satisfy some drift/small set conditions, with general assumptions on the corresponding stochastic parameters and the mixing properties of the environments. We then demonstrate the wide range of applications of our results in time series analysis and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, with fewer restrictions than those found in existing literature.

Equitably Coloring Planar and Outerplanar Graphs

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A proper $s$-coloring of an $n$-vertex graph is \emph{equitable} if every color class has size $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ or $\lceil{n/s}\rceil$. A necessary condition to have an equitable $s$-coloring is that every vertex $v$ appears in an independent set of size at least $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. That is $\min_{v\in V(G)}\alpha_v\ge \lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. Various authors showed that when $G$ is a tree and $s\ge 3$ this obvious necessary condition is also sufficient. Kierstead, Kostochka, and Xiang asked whether this result holds more generally for all outerplanar graphs. We show that the answer is No when $s=3$, but that the answer is Yes when $s\ge 6$. The case $s\in\{4,5\}$ remains open. We also prove an analogous result for planar graphs, with a necessary and sufficient hypothesis. Fix $s\ge 40$. Let $G$ be a planar graph, and let $w_0,w_1$ be its $2$ vertices with largest degrees. If there exist disjoint independent sets $I_0, I_1$ such that $|I_0|=\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ and $|I_1| = \lfloor{(n+1)/s}\rfloor$ and $w_0,w_1\in I_0\cup I_1$, then $G$ has an equitable $s$-coloring.

Learning the Influence Graph of a Markov Process that Randomly Resets to Past

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Learning the influence graph G of a high-dimensional Markov process is a challenging problem. Prior work has addressed this task when the process has finite memory. However, the more general regime in which the system probabilistically "jumps back in time" - so that the state at t+1 depends on a sample from a distant past t-d - remains unexplored. The process with probabilistic resets can be modeled as a Markov process with memory, but estimations become computationally expensive. To tackle this, we introduce PIMRecGreedy, a modification of the RecGreedy algorithm originally designed for i.i.d. samples. The proposed method does not assume memory, requires no prior knowledge of d, and recovers G with high probability even without access to the specific time indices at which such temporal jumps occur, and without imposing any constraints on the graph structures.

Under Grand Simplicity Hypothesis (GSH) for $L$-functions, we prove that $\lambda \cdot \chi_m$ is biased towards $+1$. We also give some examples where GSH is violated.

Implicit Communication in Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control Systems
Gongpu Chen, Deniz Gunduz
Comments:
27 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper studies implicit communication in linear quadratic Gaussian control systems. We show that the control system itself can serve as an implicit communication channel, enabling the controller to transmit messages through its inputs to a receiver that observes the system state. This communication is considered implicit because (i) no explicit communication channels are needed; and (ii) information is transmitted while simultaneously fulfilling the controller's primary objective--maintaining the control cost within a specified level. As a result, there exists an inherent trade-off between control and communication performance. This trade-off is formalized through the notion of implicit channel capacity, which characterizes the supremum reliable communication rate subject to a constraint on control performance. We characterize the implicit channel capacity in three settings. When both the controller and the receiver have noiseless observations of the system state, the channel capacity admits a closed-form expression. When only the controller has noiseless observations, the channel capacity is given by the solution of a convex optimization. When both the controller and the receiver have noisy observations, we establish a lower bound on the implicit capacity. Surprisingly, when the controller has noiseless observations, the capacity-achieving input policy adheres to a separation principle, allowing the control and channel coding tasks to be addressed independently, without loss of optimality. Moreover, under this capacity-achieving input policy, the implicit channel can be equivalently translated into a Gaussian MIMO channel, enabling the use of existing channel codes to achieve implicit communication.

Terwilliger algebras are a subalgebra of a matrix algebra constructed from an association scheme. Rie Tanaka defined what it means for a Terwilliger algebra to be almost commutative and gave five equivalent conditions. In this paper we first determine an equivalent sixth condition for a Terwilliger algebra coming from a commutative Schur ring to be almost commutative. We then provide a classification of which finite groups result in an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra when looking at the group association scheme determined by the conjugacy classes. In particular, we show that all such groups are either abelian, or Camina groups. We then compute the dimension of each Terwilliger algebra, and we also express each of the group association schemes with an almost commutative Terwilliger algebra as a wreath product of the group schemes of finite abelian groups and $1-$class association schemes. Furthermore, we give the non-primary primitive idempotents for each Terwilliger algebra for those groups.

Following the scheme of tent spaces in classical harmonic analysis developed by R. Coifman, Y. Meyer, and E. Stein in \cite{cms}, we succeed in doing so for the Gaussian setting. In \cite{MNP}, part of this theory (an atomic decomposition) is developed for a specific tent space where functions are defined just in a proper subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+,$ and without the use of an area function. In the present paper, using a variation of the area function considered in \cite{FSU}, we define the Gaussian area function and Gaussian tent spaces and prove both their atomic decompositions and the characterization of their dual spaces. Some applications are also considered.

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We give in this paper a survey of results obtained in our earlier papers, and state explicitly some problems of further research, for example: are the analytic ranks bounded, or not? Twists of Carlitz modules are parametrized by polynomials over finite fields $\Bbb F_q$. The analytic rank of a twist is the order of zero of its L-function at a point. The set of polynomials of degree $\le m$ such that the analytic ranks of the corresponding twists are $\ge i$ is $X(m,i)(\Bbb F_q)$ where $X(m,i)$ is an affine variety defined over $\Bbb F_p$ (we do not know what is its dimension). We consider also a related invariant of a twist, namely, the behaviour of its L-function at infinity (the rank at infinity). We know much more on varieties corresponding to twists of a fixed rank at infinity and on their lifts from $\Bbb F_p$ to $\Bbb Z$ . For example, for $q=2$ the irreducible components of these varieties are described in terms of finite rooted weighted binary trees. A similar description for $q>2$ is not found yet.

Sharpness of the phase transition for constrained-degree percolation
Ivailo Hartarsky, Roger W.C. Silva
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider constrained-degree percolation on the hypercubic lattice. Initially, all edges are closed, and each edge independently attempts to open at a uniformly distributed random time; the attempt succeeds if, at that instant, both end-vertices have degrees strictly less than a prescribed parameter. The absence of the FKG inequality and the finite energy property, as well as the infinite range of dependency, make the rigorous analysis of the model particularly challenging. In this work, we show that the one-arm probability exhibits exponential decay in its entire subcritical phase. The proof relies on the Duminil-Copin--Raoufi--Tassion randomized algorithm method and resolves a problem of dos Santos and the second author. At the heart of the argument lies an intricate combinatorial transformation of pivotality in the spirit of Aizenman--Grimmett essential enhancements, but with unbounded range. This technique may be of use in other dynamical settings.

In this paper, we give a general setup for the problem, and we suggest an easier way to obtain the Gelfand-Fuchs 2-cocycles for Hamiltonian actions on Teichmuller spaces.

In this note, we confirm a conjecture of Larson that arises in the Adams--Novikov spectral sequence (ANSS) for the stable homotopy groups of spheres and, specifically, in Behrens' program on explicit modular forms detecting $v_2$--periodic classes in the divided $\beta$-family. The conjecture predicts the supersingular order of the weight $12t$ form $L_2(\Delta^t)$, when $(p-1)\mid 12t,$ attached to the $\Gamma_0(2)$ Hecke correspondence. We prove the prediction for all primes $p\ge5$, thereby providing the precise modular input that calibrates the relevant ANSS differentials in the Behrens program and removes the last obstruction to using pure $\Delta$-power across the range of indices where Hodge-scaling cancels.

Kingman's coalescent on a random graph
Louigi Addario-Berry, Caelan Atamanchuk, Maxwell Kaye
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We introduce a generalization of Kingman's coalescent on $[n]$ that we call the Kingman coalescent on a graph $G = ([n],E)$. Specifically, we generalize a forest valued representation of the coalescent introduced in Addario-Berry and Eslava (2018). The difference between the Kingman coalescent on $G$ and the normal Kingman coalescent on $[n]$ is that two trees $T_1,T_2$ with roots $\rho_1,\rho_2$ can merge if and only if $\{\rho_1,\rho_2\} \in E$.
When this process finishes (when there are no trees left that can merge anymore), we are left with a random spanning forest that we call a Kingman forest of $G$. In this article, we study the Kingman coalescent on Erdős-Rényi random graphs, $G_{n,p}$. We derive a relationship between the Kingman coalescent on $G_{n,p}$ and uniform random recursive trees, which provides many answers concerning structural questions about the corresponding Kingman forests. We explore the heights of Kingman forests as well as the sizes of their trees as illustrative examples of how to use the connection. Our main results concern the number of trees, $C_{n,p}$, in a Kingman forest of $G_{n,p}$. For fixed $p \in (0,1)$, we prove that $C_{n,p}$ converges in distribution to an almost surely finite random variable as $n \to \infty$. For $p = p(n)$ such that $p \to 0$ and $np \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$, we prove that $C_{n,p}$ converges in probability to $\frac{2(1-p)}{p}$.

Hardness and Structural Properties of Fuzzy Edge Contraction
Shanookha Ali
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Logic (math.LO)
We investigate the computational complexity of edge-deletion and edge-contraction problems in fuzzy graphs. For any graph property {\Pi} that is hereditary under contractions (or deletions) and determined by 3-connected components, the corresponding fuzzy edge-deletion (FPED) and fuzzy edge-contraction (FPEC) problems are NP- hard. Our results hold under both fixed-threshold ({\alpha}_0) and all-threshold (\forall {\alpha}) semantics, and apply even to restricted classes of fuzzy graphs such as fuzzy 3-connected or fuzzy bipartite graphs. We further demonstrate that well-known properties, including planarity and series-parallelness, satisfy these conditions, making the fuzzy versions of these classical graph problems computationally intractable. The proofs leverage reductions from classical NP-hard problems and generalize the constructions to the fuzzy setting while preserving key structural properties.

Classical and Quantum Heuristics for the Binary Paint Shop Problem

The Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) is an $\mathsf{APX}$-hard optimisation problem in automotive manufacturing: given a sequence of $2n$ cars, comprising $n$ distinct models each appearing twice, the task is to decide which of two colours to paint each car so that the two occurrences of each model are painted differently, while minimising consecutive colour swaps. The key performance metric is the paint swap ratio, the average number of colour changes per car, which directly impacts production efficiency and cost. Prior work showed that the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) at depth $p=7$ achieves a paint swap ratio of $0.393$, outperforming the classical Recursive Greedy (RG) heuristic with an expected ratio of $0.4$ [Phys. Rev. A 104, 012403 (2021)]. More recently, the classical Recursive Star Greedy (RSG) heuristic was conjectured to achieve an expected ratio of $0.361$. In this study, we develop the theoretical foundations for applying QAOA to BPSP through a reduction of BPSP to weighted MaxCut, and use this framework to benchmark two state-of-the-art low-depth QAOA variants, eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA) and Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), at $p=1$ (denoted XQAOA$_1$ and RQAOA$_1$), against the strongest classical heuristics known to date. Across instances ranging from $2^7$ to $2^{12}$ cars, XQAOA$_1$ achieves an average ratio of $0.357$, surpassing RQAOA$_1$ and all classical heuristics, including the conjectured performance of RSG. Surprisingly, RQAOA$_1$ shows diminishing performance as size increases: despite using provably optimal QAOA$_1$ parameters at each recursion, it is outperformed by RSG on most $2^{11}$-car instances and all $2^{12}$-car instances. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report RQAOA$_1$'s performance degradation at scale. In contrast, XQAOA$_1$ remains robust, indicating strong potential to asymptotically surpass all known heuristics.

Higher-form symmetries as higher automorphism bundles
Alonso Perez-Lona
Subjects:

The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.

Many have have taken in hand to write a treatise on the Star of Bethlehem, particularly on Kepler's explanation as a stellar birth, triggered by Mars joining a great conjunction (a meeting of Jupiter and Saturn), as he observed it in October 1604. It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding "geocentric" and "heliocentric" world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.

Adaptive Algorithms with Sharp Convergence Rates for Stochastic Hierarchical Optimization
Xiaochuan Gong, Jie Hao, Mingrui Liu
Comments:
NeurIPS 2025
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$ in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Leveraging the group structure of hypotheses for more powerful multiple testing with FDR control for the filtered rejection set
Marina Bogomolov, Shinjini Nandi
Comments:
51 pages, 15 figures
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Modern biological studies often involve testing many hypotheses organized in a group or a hierarchical structure, such as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In these studies, researchers often wish to control the false discovery rate (FDR) after filtering the discoveries to obtain interpretable results. For addressing this goal, Katsevich, Sabatti, and Bogomolov (2023, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 118(541), 165-176) developed a general method, Focused BH, that guarantees FDR control for the filtered rejection set for a pre-specified filter, under certain assumptions. We propose improving the power of Focused BH by adapting it to group or hierarchical structures of hypotheses using data-dependent weights. The general method incorporating such weights is referred to as Weighted Focused BH (WFBH). For DAG-structured hypotheses, we propose a variant of WFBH, which can gain power by being adaptive to the DAG structure, and by exploiting the logical relationships among the hypotheses. We prove that WFBH with weights that were proposed to adapt the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to different group structures, as well as its proposed variant for testing DAG-structured hypotheses, control the post-filtering FDR under certain assumptions. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the latter variant is robust to deviations from these assumptions and can be considerably more powerful than comparable methods. Finally, we elucidate its practical use by applying it to real datasets from microbiome and gene expression studies.

Fluid Antenna System-assisted Physical Layer Secret Key Generation
Zhiyu Huang, Guyue Li, Hao Xu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Subjects:
Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper investigates physical-layer key generation (PLKG) in multi-antenna base station systems, by leveraging a fluid antenna system (FAS) to dynamically customize radio environments. Without requiring additional nodes or extensive radio frequency chains, the FAS effectively enables adaptive antenna port selection by exploiting channel spatial correlation to enhance the key generation rate (KGR) at legitimate nodes. To comprehensively evaluate the efficiency of the FAS in PLKG, we propose an FAS-assisted PLKG model that integrates transmit beamforming and sparse port selection under independent and identically distributed and spatially correlated channel models, respectively. Specifically, the PLKG utilizes reciprocal channel probing to derive a closed-form KGR expression based on the mutual information between legitimate channel estimates. Nonconvex optimization problems for these scenarios are formulated to maximize the KGR subject to transmit power constraints and sparse port activation. We propose an iterative algorithm by capitalizing on successive convex approximation and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain a locally optimal solution. A reweighted $\ell_1$-norm-based algorithm is applied to advocate for the sparse port activation of FAS-assisted PLKG. Furthermore, a low-complexity sliding window-based port selection is proposed to substitute reweighted $\ell_1$-norm method based on Rayleigh-quotient analysis. Simulation results demonstrate that the FAS-PLKG scheme significantly outperforms the FA-PLKG scheme in both independent and spatially correlated environments. The sliding window-based port selection method introduced in this paper has been shown to yield superior KGR, compared to the reweighted $\ell_1$-norm method. It is shown that the FAS achieves higher KGR with fewer RF chains through dynamic sparse port selection.

Subjects:

We study the estimation of distributional treatment effects in randomized experiments with imperfect compliance. When participants do not adhere to their assigned treatments, we leverage treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to identify the local distributional treatment effect-the difference in outcome distributions between treatment and control groups for the subpopulation of compliers. We propose a regression-adjusted estimator based on a distribution regression framework with Neyman-orthogonal moment conditions, enabling robustness and flexibility with high-dimensional covariates. Our approach accommodates continuous, discrete, and mixed discrete-continuous outcomes, and applies under a broad class of covariate-adaptive randomization schemes, including stratified block designs and simple random sampling. We derive the estimator's asymptotic distribution and show that it achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. Simulation results demonstrate favorable finite-sample performance, and we demonstrate the method's practical relevance in an application to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.

Fast subdivision of Bézier curves
Paweł Woźny, Filip Chudy
Subjects:
Graphics (cs.GR); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
It is well-known that a $d$-dimensional polynomial Bézier curve of degree $n$ can be subdivided into two segments using the famous de Casteljau algorithm in $O(dn^2)$ time. Can this problem be solved more efficiently? In this paper, we show that it is possible to do this in $O(dn\log{n})$ time using the fast Fourier transform and its inverse. Experiments show that the direct application of the new method performs well only for small values of $n$, as the algorithm is numerically unstable. However, a slightly modified version -- which still has $O(dn\log{n})$ computational complexity -- offers good numerical quality, which is confirmed by numerical experiments conducted in \textsf{Python}. Moreover, the new method has a nice property: if a Bézier curve is extended by an additional control point, the subdivision can be updated in $O(d)$ time.
A similar idea can be applied to speed up the subdivision of rational Bézier curves and rectangular Bézier surfaces, as well as to compute the derivatives of Bézier curves more efficiently.

Inverse Source Method for Constrained Phased Array Synthesis through Null-Space Exploitation

Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Information Theory (cs.IT)
A versatile approach for the synthesis of phased array (PA) antennas able to fit user-defined power pattern masks, while fulfilling additional geometrical and/or electrical constraints on the geometry of the array aperture and/or on the array excitations is presented. Such a synthesis method is based on the inverse source (IS) formulation and exploits the null-space of the radiation operator that causes the non-uniqueness of the IS problem at hand. More in detail, the unknown element excitations of the PA are expressed as the linear combination of a minimum-norm or radiating (RA) term and a suitable non-radiating (NR) component. The former, computed via the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of the array radiation operator, is devoted to generate a far-field power pattern that fulfills user-defined pattern masks. The other one belongs to the null-space of the radiation operator and allows one to fit additional geometrical and/or electrical constraints on the geometry of the array aperture and/or on the beam-forming network (BFN) when determined with a customized global optimization strategy. A set of numerical examples, concerned with various array arrangements and additional design targets, is reported to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Gaussian fermionic embezzlement of entanglement

Embezzlement of entanglement allows to extract arbitrary entangled states from a suitable embezzling state using only local operations while perturbing the resource state arbitrarily little. A natural family of embezzling states is given by ground states of non-interacting, critical fermions in one spatial dimension. This raises the question of whether the embezzlement operations can be restricted to Gaussian operations whenever one only wishes to extract Gaussian entangled states. We show that this is indeed the case and prove that the embezzling property is in fact a generic property of fermionic Gaussian states. Our results provide a fine-grained understanding of embezzlement of entanglement for fermionic Gaussian states in the finite-size regime and thereby bridge finite-size systems to abstract characterizations based on the classification of von Neumann algebras. To prove our results, we establish novel bounds relating the distance of covariances to the trace-distance of Gaussian states, which may be of independent interest.

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Low-Level MPC for Multi-Agent Control
Max Studt, Georg Schildbach
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Robotics (cs.RO); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Achieving safe and coordinated behavior in dynamic, constraint-rich environments remains a major challenge for learning-based control. Pure end-to-end learning often suffers from poor sample efficiency and limited reliability, while model-based methods depend on predefined references and struggle to generalize. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines tactical decision-making via reinforcement learning (RL) with low-level execution through Model Predictive Control (MPC). For the case of multi-agent systems this means that high-level policies select abstract targets from structured regions of interest (ROIs), while MPC ensures dynamically feasible and safe motion. Tested on a predator-prey benchmark, our approach outperforms end-to-end and shielding-based RL baselines in terms of reward, safety, and consistency, underscoring the benefits of combining structured learning with model-based control.

Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities

Subjects:

Predictions from statistical physics postulate that recovery of the communities in Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. This conjecture has given rise to a rich literature, proving that non-trivial community recovery is indeed possible in SBM above the KS threshold, as long as the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the observed graph. Failure of low-degree polynomials below the KS threshold was also proven when $K=o(\sqrt{n})$.
When $K\geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin et al.(2025) recently prove that, in a sparse regime, community recovery in polynomial time is possible below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This breakthrough result lead them to postulate a new threshold for the many communities regime $K\geq \sqrt{n}$. In this work, we provide evidences that confirm their conjecture for $K\geq \sqrt{n}$:
1- We prove that, for any density of the graph, low-degree polynomials fail to recover communities below the threshold postulated by Chin et al.(2025);
2- We prove that community recovery is possible in polynomial time above the postulated threshold, not only in the sparse regime of~Chin et al., but also in some (but not all) moderately sparse regimes by essentially counting clique occurence in the observed graph.

In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods. Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data. Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for efficient navigation of mobile robots in cluttered environments. The proposed approach integrates a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon trajectory optimization of the MPC. This formulation ensures convergence to dynamically selected targets and guarantees collision avoidance, even under general nonlinear dynamics and cluttered environments. The approach is validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.

The Alignment Bottleneck

Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity $\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity. Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities, consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity, manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

Localmax dynamics for attention in transformers and its asymptotic behavior

We introduce a new discrete-time attention model, termed the localmax dynamics, which interpolates between the classic softmax dynamics and the hardmax dynamics, where only the tokens that maximize the influence toward a given token have a positive weight. As in hardmax, uniform weights are determined by a parameter controlling neighbor influence, but the key extension lies in relaxing neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity parameter, which allows controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior. As we prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero, time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior of hardmax as a by-product. Finally, we adapt Lyapunov-based methods from classical opinion dynamics, highlighting their limitations in the asymmetric setting of localmax interactions and outlining directions for future research.

Optimal Experimental Design of a Moving Sensor for Linear Bayesian Inverse Problems

Subjects:

We optimize the path of a mobile sensor to minimize the posterior uncertainty of a Bayesian inverse problem. Along its path, the sensor continuously takes measurements of the state, which is a physical quantity modeled as the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) with uncertain parameters. Considering linear PDEs specifically, we derive the closed-form expression of the posterior covariance matrix of the model parameters as a function of the path, and formulate the optimal experimental design problem for minimizing the posterior's uncertainty. We discretize the problem such that the cost function remains consistent under temporal refinement. Additional constraints ensure that the path avoids obstacles and remains physically interpretable through a control parameterization. The constrained optimization problem is solved using an interior-point method. We present computational results for a convection-diffusion equation with unknown initial condition.

Viewed through the lens of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, we demonstrate that higher-form currents with nonzero ghost number also define higher-form symmetries, directly analogous to the standard higher-form symmetries with ghost number zero. These ghostly higher symmetries descend from and into conventional higher-form symmetries via chains of descent equations familiar from the theory of anomalies and topological field theories. We give examples of such chains of ghostly symmetries in Maxwell theory, Abelian and non-Abelian higher gauge theory, Yang-Mills theory, and beyond.

Wireless Channel Foundation Model with Embedded Noise-Plus-Interference Suppression Structure
Yuwei Wang, Li Sun, Tingting Yang

Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is pretrained on large-scale wireless channel datasets to learn a universal channel feature representation that can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks related to communications and sensing. While existing works on WCFM have demonstrated its great potentials in various tasks including beam prediction, channel prediction, localization, etc, the models are all trained using perfect (i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data which are generated with simulation tools. However, in practical systems where the WCFM is deployed, perfect CSI is not available. Instead, channel estimation needs to be first performed based on pilot signals over a subset of the resource elements (REs) to acquire a noisy version of the CSI (termed as degraded CSI), which significantly differs from the perfect CSI in some real-world environments with severe noise and interference. As a result, the feature representation generated by the WCFM is unable to reflect the characteristics of the true channel, yielding performance degradation in downstream tasks. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an enhanced wireless channel foundation model architecture with noise-plus-interference (NPI) suppression capability. In our approach, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained. With these information, two projection matrices are computed to extract the NPI terms in the received signals, which are further processed by a NPI estimation and subtraction module. Finally, the resultant signal is passed through a CSI completion network to get a clean version of the CSI, which is used for feature extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves improved performance on channel prediction task.

Coupling probability measures lies at the core of many problems in statistics and machine learning, from domain adaptation to transfer learning and causal inference. Yet, even when restricted to deterministic transports, such couplings are not identifiable: two atomless marginals admit infinitely many transport maps. The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost minimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct notions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first carry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps: cyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their equivalence, thereby clarifying their respective structural properties. In parallel, we formulate counterfactual reasoning within the framework of structural causal models as a problem of selecting transport maps between fixed marginals, which makes explicit the role of untestable assumptions in counterfactual reasoning. Then, we are able to connect these two perspectives by identifying conditions on causal graphs and structural equations under which counterfactual maps coincide with classical statistical transports. In this way, we delineate the circumstances in which causal assumptions support the use of a specific structure of transport map. Taken together, our results aim to enrich the theoretical understanding of families of transport maps and to clarify their possible causal interpretations. We hope this work contributes to establishing new bridges between statistical transport and causal inference.

$η_{\rm w}$-meson from topological properties of the electroweak vacuum

We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous $B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the $B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.

Boolean networks (BNs) are important models for gene regulatory networks and many other biological systems. In this paper, we study the minimal controllability problem of threshold and XOR BNs with degree constraints. Firstly, we derive lower-bound-related inequalities and some upper bounds for the number of control nodes of several classes of controllable majority-type threshold BNs. Secondly, we construct controllable majority-type BNs and BNs involving Boolean threshold functions with both positive and negative coefficients such that these BNs are associated with a small number of control nodes. Thirdly, we derive a linear-algebraic necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability of general XOR-BNs, whose update rules are based on the XOR logical operator, and construct polynomial-time algorithms for computing control-node sets and control signals for general XOR-BNs. Lastly, we use ring theory and linear algebra to establish a few best-case upper bounds for a type of degree-constrainted XOR-BNs called $k$-$k$-XOR-BNs. In particular, we show that for any positive integer $m \geq 2$ and any odd integer $k \in [3, 2^{m} - 1]$, there exists a $2^{m}$-node controllable $k$-$k$-XOR-BN with 1 control node. Our results offer theoretical insights into minimal interventions in networked systems such as gene regulatory networks.

Dynamical Similarity in Multisymplectic Field Theory

Subjects:

Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.

Estimating systematic errors in Bayesian inversion using transport maps

Comments:
25 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Probability (math.PR)
In indirect measurements, the measurand is determined by solving an inverse problem which requires a model of the measurement process. Such models are often approximations and introduce systematic errors leading to a bias of the posterior distribution in Bayesian inversion. We propose a unified framework that combines transport maps from a reference distribution to the posterior distribution with the model error approach. This leads to an adaptive algorithm that jointly estimates the posterior distribution of the measurand and the model error. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated on two model problems, showing that the approach effectively corrects biases while enabling fast sampling.

Fast OTSU Thresholding Using Bisection Method

Subjects:

The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on 48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5 gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the original Otsu method.

The dual motivic Steenrod algebra with mod $\ell$ coefficients was computed by Voevodsky over a base field of characteristic zero, and by Hoyois, Kelly, and Østvær over a base field of characteristic $p \neq \ell$. In the case $p = \ell$, we show that the conjectured answer is a retract of the actual answer. We also describe the slices of the algebraic cobordism spectrum $MGL$: we show that the conjectured form of $s_n MGL$ is a retract of the actual answer.

Fourier decay of absolutely and Hölder continuous functions with infinitely or finitely many oscillations
Juhani Nissilä
Comments:

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
The main result of this paper is, that if we suppose that a function is absolutely continuous and uniformly Hölder continuous and that its finite difference function does not oscillate infinitely often on a bounded interval, then the decay rate of its Fourier coefficients can be estimated exactly. This rate of decay predicts the same uniform Hölder continuity but the two other conditions are not necessary. Several examples from literature and by the author show that none of the assumptions can be relaxed without weakening the decay for some functions. The uniform Hölder continuity of chirps and the decay of their Fourier coefficients are studied. The main result is then applied in the estimation of the error of numerical Weyl fractional derivatives calculated using the discrete Fourier transform. The main result is also extended to Fourier transforms.

As Jordan observed in 1870, just as univariate polynomials have Galois groups, so do problems in enumerative geometry.

We discuss the current directions of this study, including open problems and conjectures.

Singularities of Ricci flow and diffeomorphisms
Tobias Holck Colding, William P. Minicozzi II
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Comparing and recognizing metrics can be extraordinarily difficult because of the group of diffeomorphisms. Two metrics, that could even be the same, could look completely different in different coordinates. This is the gauge problem. The general gauge problem is extremely subtle for non-compact spaces. Often it can be avoided if one uses some additional structure of the particular situation. However, in many problems there is no additional structure. Instead we solve the gauge problem directly in great generality.
The techniques and ideas apply to many problems. We use them to solve a well-known open problem in Ricci flow: Strong rigidity of cylinders. Strong rigidity is an illustration of a {\it shrinker principle} that uniqueness radiates out from a compact set. It implies that if one tangent flow at a future singular point is a cylinder, then all tangent flows are.
We solve the gauge problem by solving a nonlinear system of PDEs. The PDE produces a diffeomorphism that fixes an appropriate gauge in the spirit of the slice theorem for group actions. We then show optimal bounds for the displacement function of the diffeomorphism. Strong rigidity relies on gauge fixing and several other new ideas. One of these is "propagation of almost splitting", another is quadratic rigidity in the right gauge, and a third is an optimal polynomial growth bound for PDEs that holds in great generality.

Let $G$ be a complex reductive group, $\theta \colon G \to G$ an involution, and $K = G^\theta$. In arXiv:1206.5547, W. Schmid and the second named author proposed a program to study unitary representations of the corresponding real form $G_\mathbb{R}$ using $K$-equivariant twisted mixed Hodge modules on the flag variety of $G$ and their polarizations. In this paper, we make the first significant steps towards implementing this program. Our first main result gives an explicit combinatorial formula for the Hodge numbers appearing in the composition series of a standard module in terms of the Lusztig-Vogan polynomials. Our second main result is a polarized version of the Jantzen conjecture, stating that the Jantzen forms on the composition factors are polarizations of the underlying Hodge modules. Our third main result states that, for regular Beilinson-Bernstein data, the minimal $K$-type of an irreducible Harish-Chandra module lies in the lowest piece of the Hodge filtration of the corresponding Hodge module. An immediate consequence of our results is a Hodge-theoretic proof of the signature multiplicity formula of arXiv:1212.2192, which was the inspiration for this work.

Spectral gap and stability for groups and non-local games

Subjects:
Operator Algebras (math.OA)
The word stable is used to describe a situation when mathematical objects that almost satisfy an equation are close to objects satisfying it exactly. We study operator-algebraic forms of stability for unitary representations of groups and quantum synchronous strategies for non-local games. We observe in particular that simple spectral gap estimates can lead to strong quantitative forms of stability. For example, we prove that the direct product of two (flexibly) Hilbert-Schmidt stable groups is again (flexibly) Hilbert-Schmidt stable, provided that one of them has Kazhdan's property (T). We also provide a simple form and simple analysis of a non-local game with few questions, with the property that synchronous strategies with large value are close to perfect strategies involving large Pauli matrices. This simplifies one of the steps (the question reduction) in the recent announced resolution of Connes' embedding problem by Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright and Yuen.

On the first and second largest components in the percolated Random Geometric Graph

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The percolated random geometric graph $G_n(\lambda, p)$ has vertex set given by a Poisson Point Process in the square $[0,\sqrt{n}]^2$, and every pair of vertices at distance at most 1 independently forms an edge with probability $p$. For a fixed $p$, Penrose proved that there is a critical intensity $\lambda_c = \lambda_c(p)$ for the existence of a giant component in $G_n(\lambda, p)$. Our main result shows that for $\lambda > \lambda_c$, the size of the second-largest component is a.a.s. of order $(\log n)^2$. Moreover, we prove that the size of the largest component rescaled by $n$ converges almost surely to a constant, thereby strengthening results of Penrose.
We complement our study by showing a certain duality result between percolation thresholds associated to the Poisson intensity and the bond percolation of $G(\lambda, p)$ (which is the infinite volume version of $G_n(\lambda,p)$). Moreover, we prove that for a large class of graphs converging in a suitable sense to $G(\lambda, 1)$, the corresponding critical percolation thresholds converge as well to the ones of $G(\lambda,1)$.

Size-Ramsey numbers of graphs with maximum degree three

Subjects:

The size-Ramsey number $\hat{r}(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the smallest number of edges a (host) graph $G$ can have, such that for any red/blue colouring of $G$, there is a monochromatic copy of $H$ in $G$. Recently, Conlon, Nenadov and Trujić showed that if $H$ is a graph on $n$ vertices and maximum degree three, then $\hat{r}(H) = O(n^{8/5})$, improving upon the upper bound of $n^{5/3 + o(1)}$ by Kohayakawa, Rödl, Schacht and Szemerédi. In this paper we show that $\hat{r}(H)\leq n^{3/2+o(1)}$. While the previously used host graphs were vanilla binomial random graphs, we prove our result using a novel host graph construction. Our bound hits a natural barrier of the existing methods.

Multi-phase-field elasticity model based on partial rank-one energy relaxation on pairwise interfaces

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
To model mechanically-driven phase transformations using the phase-field theory, suitable models are needed for describing the mechanical fields related to individual phase-fields in the interfacial regions. They play a crucial role in obtaining the mechanical driving forces of phase-field evolution. Quantitative modeling requires satisfying the interfacial static equilibrium and kinematic compatibility conditions. To the best of our knowledge, no existing multi-phase-field elasticity model has been able to satisfy the jump conditions between all the locally-active phase-fields associated to their pairwise normals, except in the dual-phase-field regions. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-phase-field elasticity model based on the partial rank-one relaxation of the elastic energy density defined on the pairwise interfaces as a function of pairwise strains. These ad hoc pairwise definitions enable us to satisfy the static equilibrium and kinematic compatibility conditions between all the locally-active phase-fields. Different numerical examples are presented, which compare the developed model against the equal-strain and equal-stress limiting cases.

Universal families of twisted cotangent bundles
Peter Crooks
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry.
We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.

Over the last two decades, pseudospectral methods based on Lagrange interpolants have flourished in solving trajectory optimization problems and their flight implementations. In a seemingly unjustified departure from these highly successful methods, a new starting point for trajectory optimization is proposed. This starting point is based on the recently-developed concept of universal Birkhoff interpolants. The new approach offers a substantial computational upgrade to the Lagrange theory in completely flattening the rapid growth of the condition numbers from O(N2) to O(1), where N is the number of grid points. In addition, the Birkhoff-specific primal-dual computations are isolated to a well-conditioned linear system even for nonlinear, nonconvex problems. This is part I of a two-part paper. In part I, a new theory is developed on the basis of two hypotheses. Other than these hypotheses, the theoretical development makes no assumptions on the choices of basis functions or the selection of grid points. Several covector mapping theorems are proved to establish the mathematical equivalence between direct and indirect Birkhoff methods. In part II of this paper (with Proulx), it is shown that a select family of Gegenbauer grids satisfy the two hypotheses required for the theory to hold. Numerical examples in part II illustrate the power and utility of the new theory.

The distribution regression problem encompasses many important statistics and machine learning tasks, and arises in a large range of applications. Among various existing approaches to tackle this problem, kernel methods have become a method of choice. Indeed, kernel distribution regression is both computationally favorable, and supported by a recent learning theory. This theory also tackles the two-stage sampling setting, where only samples from the input distributions are available. In this paper, we improve the learning theory of kernel distribution regression. We address kernels based on Hilbertian embeddings, that encompass most, if not all, of the existing approaches. We introduce the novel near-unbiased condition on the Hilbertian embeddings, that enables us to provide new error bounds on the effect of the two-stage sampling, thanks to a new analysis. We show that this near-unbiased condition holds for three important classes of kernels, based on optimal transport and mean embedding. As a consequence, we strictly improve the existing convergence rates for these kernels. Our setting and results are illustrated by numerical experiments.

The character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ has many compactifications. We construct a continuous surjection from the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ to the oriented Gromov equivariant compactification. Our construction is based on a geometric interpretation of the elements of $\partial \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ as $\Gamma$-actions by isometries on $\mathbb{R}$-trees. We endow these $\mathbb{R}$-trees with an orientation induced by the standard orientation on the circle, which we characterize by a semialgebraic equation. Moreover, we describe the $\Gamma$-actions by orientation preserving isometries on oriented $\mathbb{R}$-trees, which arise in both compactifications, as limits of $\Gamma$-actions on the oriented hyperbolic plane, via asymptotic cones endowed with an ultralimit orientation.

Let $(X,B)$ be an $\epsilon$-lc pair of dimension $d$ with a closed point $x\in X$. Birkar and Shokurov conjectured that there is an effective Cartier divisor $H$ passing through $x$ such that $(X,B+tH)$ is lc near $x$, where $t$ is a positive real number depending only on $d,\epsilon$. We prove that this conjecture is equivalent to Shokurov's conjecture on boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations and we confirm it in dimension 2. As a corollary, we prove the boundedness of klt complements on Fano fibrations over surfaces.

The surface Houghton groups $\mathcal{H}_{n}$ are a family of groups generalizing Houghton groups $H_n$, which are constructed as asymptotically rigid mapping class groups. We give a complete computation of the BNSR-invariants $\Sigma^{m}(P\mathcal{H}_{n})$ of their intersection with the pure mapping class group. To do so, we prove that the associated Stein--Farley cube complex is CAT(0), and we adapt Zaremsky's method for computing the BNSR-invariants of the Houghton groups. As a consequence, we give a criterion for when subgroups of $H_n$ and $P\mathcal{H}_{n}$ having the same finiteness length as their parent group are finite index. We also discuss the failure of some of these groups to be co-Hopfian.

When $A$ is the base field, we recover the previously-studied affine Brauer category; for other choices of $A$, the categories are novel. Finally, we state a conjecture for bases of homomorphism spaces in affine Frobenius Brauer categories, and outline a potential proof strategy.

This work inspects a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, namely Chernoff differential privacy, due to its significance in characterization of the optimal classifier's performance. Adversarial classification, as any other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work, we characterize the relationship between $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy, the best error exponent of one of the errors (when the other is fixed) and the best average error exponent. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff differential privacy in connection with $\varepsilon\textrm{-}$differential privacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and prove its relation with Kullback-Leibler (KL) differential privacy. Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ and the impact of the adversary's attack in Laplace mechanisms. Lastly, we introduce a new upper bound on adversary's membership advantage in membership inference attacks using Chernoff DP and numerically compare its performance with existing alternatives based on $(\varepsilon, \delta)\textrm{-}$differential privacy in the literature.

Title:
Treewidth of generalized Hamming graph, bipartite Kneser graph and generalized Petersen graph
Yichen Wang, Mengyu Cao, Zequn Lv, Mei Lu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $t,q$ and $n$ be positive integers. Write $[q] = \{1,2,\ldots,q\}$. The generalized Hamming graph $H(t,q,n)$ is the graph whose vertex set is the cartesian product of $n$ copies of $[q]$$(q\ge 2)$, where two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is at most $t$. In particular, $H(1,q,n)$ is the well-known Hamming graph and $H(1,2,n)$ is the hypercube. In 2006, Chandran and Kavitha described the asymptotic value of $tw(H(1,q,n))$, where $tw(G)$ denotes the treewidth of $G$. In this paper, we give the exact pathwidth of $H(t,2,n)$ and show that $tw(H(t,q,n)) = \Theta(tq^n/\sqrt{n})$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Based on those results, we show that the treewidth of bipartite Kneser graph $BK(n,k)$ is $\binom{n}{k} - 1$ when $n$ is sufficient large relative to $k$ and the bounds of $tw(BK(2k+1,k))$ are given. Moreover, we present the bounds of the treewidth of generalized Petersen graph.

We provide a model-theoretic classification of the countable homogeneous $\mathbf{H}_4$-free 3-hypertournament studied by Cherlin, Hubička, Konečný, and Nešetřil. Our main result is that the theory of this structure is $\mathrm{SOP}_3$, $\mathrm{TP}_2$, and $\mathrm{NSOP}_4$. We offer two proofs of this fact: one is a direct proof, and the other employs part of the abstract machinery recently developed by Mutchnik.

The Riemannian geometry of Sinkhorn divergences

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
We propose a new metric between probability measures on a compact metric space that mirrors the Riemannian manifold-like structure of quadratic optimal transport but includes entropic regularization. Its metric tensor is given by the Hessian of the Sinkhorn divergence, a debiased variant of entropic optimal transport. We precisely identify the tangent space it induces, which turns out to be related to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). As usual in Riemannian geometry, the distance is built by looking for shortest paths. We prove that our distance is geodesic, metrizes the weak-star topology, and is equivalent to a RKHS norm. Still it retains the geometric flavor of optimal transport: as a paradigmatic example, translations are geodesics for the quadratic cost on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also show two negative results on the Sinkhorn divergence that may be of independent interest: that it is not jointly convex, and that its square root is not a distance because it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality.

Tighter Bounds on the Expected Absorbing Time of Ungarian Markov Chains

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
In $2023$, Defant and Li defined the Ungarian Markov chain $\mathbf{U}_L$ associated to a finite lattice $L$. This Markov chain has state space $L$, and from any state $x \in L$ transitions to the meet of $\{x\} \cup T$, where $T$ is a randomly selected subset of the elements of $L$ covered by $x$. For any lattice $L$, let $\mathcal{E}(L)$ be the expected number of steps until the maximal element of $L$ transitions into the minimal element in the Ungarian Markov chain. We show that $\mathcal{E}(L)$ is linear in $n$ when $L$ is the weak order on the symmetric group $S_n$, and satisfies an $n^{1-o(1)}$ lower bound when $L$ is the $n^\text{th}$ Tamari lattice. This completely resolves a conjecture by Defant and Li and partially resolves another.

Analytic Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We develop a novel EDMD-type algorithm that captures the spectrum of the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions. This method, which we call analytic EDMD, relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to a data-driven Taylor approximation. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, analytic EDMD demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice-structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation. The performance of analytic EDMD is illustrated with numerical examples and is assessed through a comparative study with related methods. Finally, the method is complemented with theoretical results, proving strong convergence of the eigenfunctions and providing error bounds on the spectrum estimation.

Starting from its original definition in module categories with respect to projective modules, the index has played an important role in various aspects of homological algebra, categorification of cluster algebras and $K$-theory. In the last few years, the notion of index has been generalised to several different contexts in (higher) homological algebra, typically with respect to a (higher) cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of the relevant ambient category $\mathcal{C}$. The recent tools of extriangulated and higher-exangulated categories have permitted some conditions on the subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ to be relaxed. In this paper, we introduce the index with respect to a generating, contravariantly finite subcategory of a $d$-exact category that has $d$-kernels. We show that our index has the important property of being additive on $d$-exact sequences up to an error term.

Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis
Lukas Silvester Barth, Hannaneh Fahimi, Parvaneh Joharinad, Jürgen Jost, Janis Keck, Thomas Jan Mikhail
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Category Theory (math.CT); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced by David Spivak about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to manifold learning, dimension reduction and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions. We generalize the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$, and show that $\mathbf{UM}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$. Furthermore, we prove analogous results for the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$. We also provide rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. Additionally, we developed a new embedding method that allows to preserve clusters detected in the original metric space that we construct from the data. The visualization of the optimization process gives the user information, both about the inner-cluster distributions in the original metric space and their inter-cluster relations. We compare our new method with UMAP, Isomap and t-SNE on a series of low- and high-dimensional datasets and provide explanations for observed differences and improvements.

Recovery of rational functions via Hankel pencil method and sensitivities of the poles
Nadiia Derevianko
Comments:
23 pages
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we introduce a new approach for the recovery of rational functions. The concept we propose is based on using the exponential structure of the Fourier coefficients of rational functions and the reconstruction of this exponential structure in the frequency domain. We choose ESPRIT as a method for the exponential recovery. The matrix pencil structure of this approach is the reason for its selection, as it makes our method suitable for the sensitivity analysis. According to our method, poles located inside and outside the unit circle are reconstructed independently as eigenvalues of some special Hankel matrix pencils. Furthermore, we derived formulas for sensitivities of poles of rational functions in case of unstructured and structured perturbations. Finally, we consider several numerical experiments and, using sensitivities, explain the recovery errors for poles.

In this article, we study the decomposition into irreducible components of the fixed point locus under the action of $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ of the smooth Nakajima quiver variety of the Jordan quiver. The quiver variety associated with the Jordan quiver is either isomorphic to the punctual Hilbert scheme in $\mathbb{C}^2$ or to the Calogero-Moser space. We describe the irreducible components using quiver varieties of McKay's quiver associated with the finite subgroup $\Gamma$ and we have given a general combinatorial model of the indexing set of these irreducible components in terms of certain elements of the root lattice of the affine Lie algebra associated with $\Gamma$. Finally, we prove that for every projective, symplectic resolution of a wreath product singularity, there exists an irreducible component of the fixed point locus of the punctual Hilbert scheme in the plane that is isomorphic to the resolution.

Failure of weak-type endpoint restriction estimates for quadratic manifolds
Sam Craig
Comments:
Final version. To appear in Journal of Geometric Analysis
Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
It is well-known that the Fourier extension operator for the paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be weak-type bounded at the restriction endpoint $q = 2d/(d-1)$, since such an estimate would imply bounds for the Kakeya maximal function which contradict the existence of Besicovitch sets. We generalize this approach to prove that the Fourier extension operator for an $n$-dimensional quadratic manifold $\mathcal{M}$ cannot be weak-type bounded at the restriction endpoint. The key step in this proof is constructing a set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ containing a translate of every plane normal to $\mathcal{M}$ which can be covered by $\lesssim \delta^{-d}\left(\frac{\log \log (1/\delta)}{\log (1/\delta)}\right)^{n/(d-n)}$ many $\delta$-balls. Such a set rules out endpoint bounds for the associated Kakeya maximal function and hence weak-type endpoint estimates for the restriction operator.

Subjects:

We develop new techniques in order to deal with Riccati-type equations, subject to a further algebraic constraint, on Riemannian manifolds $(M^3,g)$. We find that the obstruction to solve the aforementioned equation has order $4$ in the metric coefficients and is fully described by an homogeneous polynomial in $\mathrm{Sym}^{16}TM$. Techniques from real algebraic geometry, reminiscent of those used for the "PositiveStellen-Satz " problem, allow determining the geometry in terms of the connection coefficients and a class of Hessian-type equations. Analysis of the latter shows flatness for the metric $g$; in particular we complete the classification of asymptotically harmonic manifolds of dimension $3$, establishing those are either flat or real hyperbolic spaces.

Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra. We perform complete computations of the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra for a myriad of examples, including the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups, and self-similar actions of free abelian groups and lamplighter groups. The key development is the construction, for arbitrary self-similar group actions, of long exact sequences which compute the homology and K-theory in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of X.~Li, we are able to show that Röver's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $V$ is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more Röver--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.

Contextual Stochastic Optimization for Omnichannel Multi-Courier Order Fulfillment Under Delivery Time Uncertainty
Tinghan Ye, Sikai Cheng, Amira Hijazi, Pascal Van Hentenryck
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The paper studies a large-scale order fulfillment problem for a leading e-commerce company in the United States. The challenge involves selecting fulfillment centers and shipping carriers with observational data only to efficiently process orders from a vast network of physical stores and warehouses. The company's current practice relies on heuristic rules that choose the cheapest fulfillment and shipping options for each unit, without considering opportunities for batching items or the reliability of carriers in meeting expected delivery dates. The paper develops a data-driven Contextual Stochastic Optimization (CSO) framework that integrates distributional forecasts of delivery time deviations with stochastic and robust order fulfillment optimization models. The framework optimizes the selection of fulfillment centers and carriers, accounting for item consolidation and delivery time uncertainty. Validated on a real-world data set containing tens of thousands of products, each with hundreds to thousands of fulfillment options, the proposed CSO framework significantly enhances the accuracy of meeting customer-expected delivery dates compared to current practices. It provides a flexible balance between reducing fulfillment costs and managing delivery time deviation risks, emphasizing the importance of contextual information and distributional forecasts in order fulfillment. This is the first paper that studies the omnichannel multi-courier order fulfillment problem with delivery time uncertainty through the lens of contextual optimization, fusing machine learning and optimization.

Measurability and continuity of parametric low-rank approximation in Hilbert spaces: linear operators and random variables
Nicola Rares Franco
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a unified theoretical framework for parametric low-rank approximation, a research area devoted to the development of efficient algorithms that act as adaptive alternatives of traditional methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Applications include, e.g., the numerical treatment of parameter-dependent partial differential equations, where operators vary with parameters, and the statistical analysis of longitudinal data, where complex measurements, like audio signals and images, are collected over time. Recently, several adaptive algorithms have emerged, but a common mathematical foundation is still lacking, and existing solutions remain constrained to specific applications. As a result, key theoretical questions -- such as the existence and regularity of optimal parametric low-rank approximants -- remain inadequately addressed. Our goal is to bridge this gap between theory and practice by establishing a rigorous framework for parametric low-rank approximation under minimal assumptions, specifically focusing on cases where parameterizations are either measurable or continuous. The analysis is carried out within the context of separable Hilbert spaces, ensuring applicability to both finite and infinite-dimensional settings. Finally, connections to recently emerging trends in the Deep Learning literature, relevant for engineering and data science, are also discussed.

We investigate the property of a spatial graph of having a leveled embedding and characterize the abstract graphs with this property. We show that all leveled embeddings are free and we compare leveled and paneled (also known as flat) embeddings. Two new graph invariants are introduced: the level number, an invariant for graphs that admit a leveled embedding, and the Hamiltonian level number, an invariant for Hamiltonian graphs. These invariants provide a measure on how far a graph is from being planar. We study the relation between the (Hamiltonian) level number and other graph invariants that minimize the decomposition of a graph in planar subgraphs, namely the thickness and the book thickness of a graph. We characterize graphs with low level number and determine both the level number and the Hamiltonian level number of complete graphs and of complete bipartite graphs.

We determine universality of $C_f$ when $f$ is restricted to (subsets of) Baker and wandering domains. We then describe the behaviour of universal vectors, under the action of iterates of the symbol $f$, near periodic points of $f$ or near infinity. Finally, we establish a principal universality theorem for the more general class of weighted composition operators, which we then apply to uncover universality results in the context of various types of Fatou components of the associated symbol.

We investigate the thermodynamic limit for the cubic-quintic Schrödinger model as the size of the domain tends to infinity with fixed density $\rho:= N/|\mathcal{D}|$, where $N$ denotes particle number and $|\mathcal{D}|$ denotes the volume of the bounded domain $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2,3$). For density satisfying \(0<\rho\leq 3/4\), we prove that the thermodynamic limit of the ground state energy for the cubic-quintic Schrödinger model exists, and is actually equal to the corresponding Thomas-Fermi ground state energy. Further more, when \(\mathcal{D}\) is a spherical domain, we prove that, up to a scaling, the ground state minimizer of the cubic-quintic Schrödinger energy will converges to a Thomas-Fermi minimizer strongly in $L^2\cap L^6$, and then we obtain the $L^\infty$-convergence rate by developing a novel energy method, which may be applicable to other general nonlinearities. As a by-product, we study the Thomas-Fermi limit for this model in the whole space \(\mathbb{R}^d\) as the particle number \(N\) tends to infinity.

This approach also leads to a direct proof of convergence to the invariant measure, along with explicit convergence rates. We show how our method can be applied to a class of related Markov chains including the logistic map, the tent map and Chebyshev maps of arbitrary order.

Large graph limits of local matching algorithms on Configuration model graphs
Mohamed Habib Aliou Diallo Aoudi, Pascal Moyal, Vincent Robin
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this work, we propose a large-graph limit estimate of the matching coverage for several matching algorithms, on general graphs generated by the configuration model. For a wide class of {\em local} matching algorithms, namely, algorithms that only use information on the immediate neighborhood of the explored nodes, we propose a joint construction of the graph by the configuration model, and of the resulting matching on the latter graph. This leads to a generalization in infinite dimension of the differential equation method of Wormald: We keep track of the matching algorithm over time by a measure-valued CTMC, for which we prove the convergence, to the large-graph limit, to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit, identified as the unique solution of a system of ODE's in the space of integer measures. Then, the asymptotic proportion of nodes covered by the matching appears as a simple function of that solution. We then make this solution explicit for three particular local algorithms: the classical {\sc greedy} algorithm, and then the {\sc uni-min} and {\sc uni-max} algorithms, two variants of the greedy algorithm that select, as neighbor of any explored node, its neighbor having the least (respectively largest) residual degree.

For a prime $p$ congruent to three modulo four, we prove that there exists a smooth curve of genus five in characteristic $p$ that is supersingular. We produce this curve as an unramified double cover of a curve of genus three. We conjecture that the setting of unramified double covers of curves of genus three also produces supersingular curves of genus five when $p$ is congruent to one modulo four, and we computationally verify this conjecture for primes less than $100$. These results can be viewed as a generalization of work of Ekedahl and of Harashita, Kudo, and Senda.

As applications, we obtain new estimates on the rate of memory loss for random ergodic compositions of Pomeau--Manneville type intermittent maps and intermittent maps with unbounded derivatives.

We study approximation of the embedding $\ell_p^m \hookrightarrow \ell_q^m$, $1 \leq p < q \leq \infty$, based on randomized algorithms that use up to $n$ arbitrary linear functionals as information on a problem instance where $n \ll m$. By analysing adaptive methods we show upper bounds for which the information-based complexity $n$ exhibits only a $(\log\log m)$-dependence. In the case $q < \infty$ we use a multi-sensitivity approach in order to reach optimal polynomial order in $n$ for the Monte Carlo error. We also improve on non-adaptive methods for $q < \infty$ by denoising known algorithms for uniform approximation.

We define and study a natural category of graph limits.

Morphisms are random maps between the underlying measurable spaces which preserve the distribution of vertices as well as the distribution of edges. We also define a convergence notion (inspired by s-convergence) for sequences of graph limits. We apply tools from category theory to prove the compactness of the space of all graph limits.

We provide a procedure for generating the irreducible representations of crystallography groups in any dimension. We also furnish a strategy to investigate the topology of the unitary dual of a crystallography group using sequences of matrices. All irreducible representations (up to unitary equivalence) of the dimension 3 crystallography group 90 and some calculations involving sequences of these irreducible representations are included as a proof of concept of this procedure and strategy.

Given a smooth open oriented surface $X$ endowed with a family of complex structures $\{J_b\}_{b\in B}$ of some Hölder class and depending continuously or smoothly on the parameter $b$ in a suitable topological space $B$, we construct continuous or smooth families $F_b:X\to Y$, $b\in B$, of $J_b$-holomorphic maps to any Oka manifold $Y$, with approximation on a suitable family of compact Runge sets in $X$. Along the way, we prove Runge and Mergelyan approximation theorems and Weierstrass interpolation theorem for functions on such families. We include applications to the construction of families of directed holomorphic immersions and conformal minimal immersions to Euclidean spaces.

Permutation recovery of spikes in noisy high-dimensional tensor estimation

We study the dynamics of gradient flow in high dimensions for the multi-spiked tensor problem, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations. Specifically, we analyze the maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which involves optimizing a highly nonconvex random function. We determine the sample complexity required for gradient flow to efficiently recover all spikes, without imposing any assumptions on the separation of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). More precisely, our results provide the sample complexity required to guarantee recovery of the spikes up to a permutation. Our work builds on our companion paper [Ben Arous, Gerbelot, Piccolo 2024], which studies Langevin dynamics and determines the sample complexity and separation conditions for the SNRs necessary for ensuring exact recovery of the spikes (where the recovered permutation matches the identity). During the recovery process, the correlations between the estimators and the hidden vectors increase in a sequential manner. The order in which these correlations become significant depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, which ultimately determines the permutation of the recovered spikes.

Dynamics of the general $Q$-tensor model interacting with a rigid body

Comments:
Accepted in SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this article, the fluid-rigid body interaction problem of nematic liquid crystals described by the general Beris-Edwards $Q$-tensor model is studied. It is proved first that the total energy of this problem decreases in time. The associated mathematical problem is a quasilinear mixed-order system with moving boundary. After the transformation to a fixed domain, a monolithic approach based on the added mass operator and lifting arguments is employed to establish the maximal $L^p$-regularity of the linearized problem in an anisotropic ground space. This paves the way for the local strong well-posedness for large data and global strong well-posedness for small data of the interaction problem.

Isomorphism in Union-Closed Sets
M. J. Moghaddas Mehr
Comments:
12 pages, 1 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We prove that for any isomorphism $h: \mathcal{K}_1 \to \mathcal{K}_2$ between pure union-closed families, there exists a hyperisomorphism $H: \bigcup \mathcal{K}_1 \to \bigcup \mathcal{K}_2$ such that $h(A) = \{ H(a) \mid a \in A \}$, for all $A \in \mathcal{K}_1$. Since every union-closed family forms a lattice under inclusion, this result establishes a strong connection between the two frameworks. More precisely, any such family can be uniquely reconstructed from its lattice up to isomorphism. Hence, the lattice representation provides a faithful encoding, offering a perspective that may yield new insights into problems on union-closed families, including Frankl's union-closed sets conjecture.

Balanced sets and homotopy invariants of covers
Mikhail V. Bludov
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we study a construction of homotopy invariants of open or closed covers, where the homotopy class is defined relative to a pair $(V,r)$, with $V$ a finite set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $r$ a point in the interior of their convex hull. We show that the simplicial complex of non-balanced subsets associated with $(V,r)$ has the homotopy type of a sphere, and use this to develop a theory of homotopy invariants of covers relative to balanced sets. A key result is that the homotopy class of a cover depends only, up to an involution, on the balanced-equivalence class of $(V,r)$. As applications, we obtain extension theorems for covers in this setting and derive the KKMS lemma, its analogues, and related combinatorial fixed-point results.

The rank of a ring $R$ is the supremum of minimal cardinalities of generating sets of $I$, among all ideals $I$ in $R$. In this paper, we obtain a characterization of Noetherian rings $R$ whose rank is not equal to the supremum of ranks of localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. It turns out that any such ring is a direct product of a finite number of local principal Artinian rings and Dedekind domains, at least one of which is not a principal ideal ring. As an application, we show that the rank of the ring of polynomials over an Artinian ring can be computed locally.

Exploratory Randomization for Discrete-Time Linear Exponential Quadratic Gaussian (LEQG) Problem
Sebastien Lleo, Wolfgang Runggaldier
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM)
We investigate exploratory randomization for an extended linear-exponential-quadratic-Gaussian (LEQG) control problem in discrete time. This extended control problem is related to the structure of risk-sensitive investment management applications. We introduce exploration through a randomization of the control. Next, we apply the duality between free energy and relative entropy to reduce the LEQG problem to an equivalent risk-neutral LQG control problem with an entropy regularization term, see, e.g. Dai Pra et al. (1996), for which we present a solution approach based on Dynamic Programming. Our approach, based on the energy-entropy duality may also be considered as leading to a justification for the use, in the literature, of an entropy regularization when applying a randomized control.

A Framework for Stochastic Fairness in Dominant Resource Allocation with Cloud Computing Applications
Jiaqi Lei, Akhil Singla, Sanjay Mehrotra
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Allocation of limited resources under uncertain requirements often necessitates fairness considerations, with applications in computer systems, health systems, and humanitarian logistics. This paper introduces a distributionally robust (DR) stochastic fairness framework for multi-resource allocation, leveraging rough estimates of the mean and variance of resource requirement distributions. The framework employs a sampled approximation DR (SA-DR) model to develop the concept of stochastic fairness, satisfying key properties such as stochastic Pareto efficiency, stochastic sharing incentive, and stochastic envy-freeness under suitable conditions. We show the convergence of the SA-DR model to the DR model and propose a finitely convergent algorithm to solve the SA-DR model. We empirically evaluate the performance of our moment-based SA-DR model -- which uses only rough estimates of the mean and variance of the resource requirement distribution -- against alternative resource allocation models under varying levels of information availability. We demonstrate that our moment-based partial-information SA-DR model can achieve performance closer to the full-information model than the worst-case information model. Convergence of the sampled approximation model and comparisons across models are illustrated using data from cloud computing applications.

The Korteweg-de Vries Equation on general star graphs

Minor revisions have been made. To appear in Zeitschrift für angewandte Mathematik und Physik
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we establish local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem associated with the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation on a general metric star graph. The graph comprises m + k semi-infinite edges: k negative half-lines and m positive half-lines, all joined at a common vertex. The choice of boundary conditions is compatible with the conditions determined by the semigroup theory. The crucial point in this work is to obtain the integral formula using the forcing operator method and the Fourier restriction method of Bourgain. This work extends the results obtained by Cavalcante for the specific case of the Y junction to a more general class of star graphs.

Compactness and non-compactness theorems of the fourth- and sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problems
Liuwei Gong, Seunghyeok Kim, Juncheng Wei

114 pages. All comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We provide a complete resolution to the question of compactness for the full solution sets of the fourth-order and sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problems on smooth closed Riemannian manifolds not conformally diffeomorphic to the standard unit $n$-sphere, provided the associated conformally covariant differential operator has a positive Green's function.
Firstly, we prove that the solution set of the fourth-order constant $Q$-curvature problem is $C^4$-compact in dimensions $5 \le n \le 24$. For $n \ge 25$, an example of an $L^{\infty}$-unbounded sequence of solutions has been known for over a decade (Wei and Zhao). Additionally, the compactness result for $5 \le n \le 9$ was established by Li and Xiong.
Secondly, we demonstrate that the solution set of the sixth-order constant $Q$-curvature problem is $C^6$-compact in dimensions $7 \le n \le 26$, whereas a blow-up example exists for $n \ge 27$.
Our main observation is that the linearized equations associated with both $Q$-curvature problems can be transformed into overdetermined linear systems, which admit nontrivial solutions due to unexpected algebraic structures of the Paneitz operator and the sixth-order GJMS operator. This key insight not only plays a crucial role in deducing the compactness result for high-dimensional manifolds, but also reveals an elegant hierarchical pattern with respect to the order of the conformally covariant operators, suggesting the possibility of a unified theory of the compactness of the constant $Q$-curvature problems of all admissible even integer orders.

Subjects:

Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.

Achieving Optimal Sample Complexity for a Broader Class of Signals in Sparse Phase Retrieval
Mengchu Xu, Yuxuan Zhang, Jian Wang
Comments:
13 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Sparse phase retrieval, which aims to recover a $k$-sparse signal from $m$ phaseless measurements, poses a fundamental question regarding the minimal sample complexity required for success. While the optimal sample complexity is known to be $\Omega(k \log n)$, existing algorithms can only achieve it for signals under restrictive structural assumptions. This paper introduces a novel and robust initialization algorithm, termed \ac{gESP}, designed to overcome this limitation. Theoretically, we prove that gESP significantly expands the family of signals that can be recovered with the optimal sample complexity. Our analysis unifies existing results on previously studied signal models and surpasses them by establishing performance bounds for a more general class of signals. Extensive simulations validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that gESP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse signal types, thereby pushing the boundaries of efficient and optimal sparse phase retrieval.

An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is strict normal crossing (SNC) if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of arbitrary Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. The family of these loci forms an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the minimal generators of the bihomogeneous prime ideal that defines this variety.

Subjects:

This paper concerns the topological classification of continuous Hamiltonians that find applications in biased cold plasmas and photonics. Besides a magnetic bias, the Hamiltonians are parametrized by a plasma frequency and a fixed vertical wavenumber. Eight distinct phases of matter are identified as these parameters vary. When insulating gaps are shared by two such phases, asymmetric edge modes propagate along interfaces separating the two phases. Here we apply the notion of a bulk difference invariant (BDI) to this Hamiltonian, and show by numerical diagonalizations of interface Hamiltonians that after an appropriate regularization our BDI correctly predicts edge transport as described by a bulk edge correspondence. We also derive theoretical tools to compute the BDI and show the limitations of the bulk edge correspondence (BEC) when the phase transition is too singular.

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we introduce GridapROMs, a Julia-based library for the numerical approximation of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) using a comprehensive suite of linear reduced order models (ROMs). The library is designed to be extendable and productive, leveraging an expressive high-level API built on the Gridap PDE solver backend, while achieving high performance through Julia's just-in-time compiler and advanced lazy evaluation techniques. GridapROMs is PDE-agnostic, enabling its application to a wide range of problems, including linear, nonlinear, single-field, multi-field, steady, and unsteady equations. This work details the library's key innovations, implementation principles, and core components, providing usage examples and demonstrating its capabilities by solving a fluid dynamics problem modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a 3D geometry.

On the dimension of the boundaries of attracting basins of entire maps

Subjects:

Let $f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ be a transcendental entire map from the Eremenko-Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$, and let $\zeta$ be an attracting periodic point of period $p$. We prove that the boundaries of components of the attracting basin of (the orbit of) $\zeta$ have hyperbolic (and, consequently, Hausdorff) dimension larger than $1$, provided $f^p$ has an infinite degree on an immediate component $U$ of the basin, and the singular set of $f^p|_U$ is compactly contained in $U$. The same holds for the boundaries of components of the basin of a parabolic $p$-periodic point $\zeta$, under the additional assumption $\zeta \notin \overline{\text{Sing}(f^p)}$. We also prove that if an immediate component of an attracting basin of an arbitrary transcendental entire map is bounded, then the boundaries of components of the basin have hyperbolic dimension larger than $1$. This enables us to show that the boundary of a component of an attracting basin of a transcendental entire function is never a smooth or rectifiable curve. The results provide a partial answer to a question from Hayman's list of problems in function theory.

In his 1970 ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims for certain varieties, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that a simply-connected variety is l-adic homotopic equivalent to a simply-connected finite CW complex if and only if the l-profinite completion of its etale homotopy type admits an l-local lifting.

We then specialize our attention to a generalization of crystallographic groups dubbed \textit{crystal-like}. We demonstrate that in this scenario a \textit{point group} is well defined and the order of this point group is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. We close by using these tools to demonstrate that crystallographic (as a group property) is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. These three tools combine to prove that $2D$ crystallographic groups are $C^*$-superrigid.

We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.

On expectations and variances in the hard-core model on bounded degree graphs

Comments:
19 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
We extend the study of the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model in two novel directions. One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction.
In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model. Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs.

Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces (the complex case and beyond)
Salem Said
Comments:
first draft ; technical report
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The present work is concerned with Gaussian integrals on simply connected non-positively curved Riemannian symmetric spaces. It is motivated by the aim of explicitly finding the high-rank limit of these integrals for each of the eleven families of classical Riemannian symmetric spaces. To begin, it deals with the easier complex case (where the isometry group admits a complex Lie group structure). To go beyond this case, it introduces a variational characterisation of the high-rank limit, as the minimum of a certain energy functional over the space of probability distributions on the real line. Using this new variational formulation, it is possible to recover the high-rank limit in closed form, from the expression originally found in the complex case. This two-step approach is illustrated through the examples of two kinds of symmetric spaces : symmetric cones and classical symmetric domains. Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces, and particularly their high-rank limits, have proved important in both statistics and theoretical physics. The present work proposes an approach for dealing with these limits, which has the merit of yielding general, concrete, closed-form results.

We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders. Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional information for robust data representation.

We study oplax colimits of stable categories, of hermitian categories and of Poincaré categories in nice cases. This allows us to produce a categorical model of the assembly map of a bordism-invariant functor of Poincaré categories which is also a Verdier projection, whose kernel we explicitly describe. As a direct application, we generalize the Shaneson splitting for bordism-invariant functors of Poincaré categories proved by Calmès-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle to allow for twists. We also show our methods can tackle their general twisted Shaneson splitting of Poincaré-Verdier localizing invariants which specifies to a twisted Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for the underlying stable categories, generalizing part of recent work of Kirstein-Kremer.

Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four. All the obtained results can be verified directly by using the program suite of our novel algorithms presented in [17, 18, 19, 20]. We note that although Singer's conjecture still holds for the case of rank 4, it no longer holds for rank 6, as announced in our most recent work [20].

Words avoiding the morphic images of most of their factors
Pascal Ochem, Matthieu Rosenfeld
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We say that a finite factor $f$ of a word $w$ is \emph{imaged} if there exists a non-erasing morphism $m$, distinct from the identity, such that $w$ contains $m(f)$. We show that every infinite word contains an imaged factor of length at least 6 and that 6 is best possible. We show that every infinite binary word contains at least 36 distinct imaged factors and that 36 is best possible.

Dominating manifolds by radial spaces
Samuel Bronstein
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
This paper is devoted to a kind of rearrangement of functions on CD(k,n)-spaces, which satisfy a Polya-Szegö type inequality. We use this rearrangement to prove the validity of a Moser-Trudinger type inequality on a wide class of metric measure spaces satisfying a CD(k,n)-curvature-dimension inequality. As a consequence, we give a characterization, among manifolds with lower bounded Ricci curvature, of those admitting a Moser-Trudinger type inequality.

A $\mathcal C^\infty$-structure-based approach to traveling wave solutions of the gKdV equation
Antonio J. Pan-Collantes
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
A novel geometric method is applied to the problem of describing traveling wave solutions of the generalized Korteweg--de Vries (gKdV) equation in the form $$ u_t + u_{xxx} + a(u)u_x = 0, $$ where $a(u)$ is a smooth function characterizing the nonlinearity. Using the traveling wave ansatz, the gKdV equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which we analyze via the $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure-based method, a geometric framework involving sequences of involutive distributions and Pfaffian equations. Starting with the symmetry $\partial_z$, we construct a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure for the ODE and apply the stepwise integration algorithm to obtain an implicit general solution. Then we derive explicit solutions for specific forms of $a(u)$, including the modified KdV and Schamel--KdV equations, as well as power-law nonlinearities.

Finite-dimensional model spaces invariant under composition operators

Subjects:

Finite-dimensional model spaces are quotient spaces of the Hardy space on the open unit disc, determined by finite Blaschke products. Composition operators, on the other hand, act by composing Hardy space functions with analytic self-maps of the open unit disc. Both are classical and well-studied objects in the theory of analytic function spaces. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of finite-dimensional model spaces that are invariant under composition operators. Finite cyclic groups and the prime factorizations of natural numbers play a crucial role in understanding the structure of such invariant subspaces and the associated analytic self-maps.

On a fractional semilinear Neumann problem arising in Chemotaxis

Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study a semilinear and nonlocal Neumann problem, which is the fractional analogue of the problem considered by Lin--Ni--Takagi in the '80s. The model under consideration arises in the description of stationary configurations of the Keller--Segel model for chemotaxis, when a nonlocal diffusion for the concentration of the chemical is considered. In particular, we extend to any fractional power $s\in (0,1)$ of the Laplacian (with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions) the results obtained in [20] for $s=1/2$. We prove existence and some qualitative properties of non--constant solutions when the diffusion parameter $\varepsilon$ is small enough, and on the other hand, we show that for $\varepsilon$ large enough any solution must be necessarily constant.

Gaussian Sequence Model: Sample Complexities of Testing, Estimation and LFHT
Zeyu Jia, Yury Polyanskiy
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We study the Gaussian sequence model, i.e. $X \sim N(\mathbf{\theta}, I_\infty)$, where $\mathbf{\theta} \in \Gamma \subset \ell_2$ is assumed to be convex and compact. We show that goodness-of-fit testing sample complexity is lower bounded by the square-root of the estimation complexity, whenever $\Gamma$ is orthosymmetric. We show that the lower bound is tight when $\Gamma$ is also quadratically convex, thus significantly extending validity of the testing-estimation relationship from [GP24]. Using similar methods, we also completely characterize likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT) complexity for $\ell_p$-bodies, discovering new types of tradeoff between the numbers of simulation and observation samples.

Designing efficient interventions for pre-disease states using control theory

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
To extend healthy life expectancy in an aging society, it is crucial to prevent various diseases at pre-disease states. Although dynamical network biomarker theory has been developed for pre-disease detection, mathematical frameworks for pre-disease treatment have not been well established. Here I propose a control theory-based approach for pre-disease treatment, named Markov chain sparse control (MCSC), where time evolution of a probability distribution on a Markov chain is described as a discrete-time linear system. By designing a sparse controller, a few candidate states for intervention are identified. The validity of MCSC is demonstrated using numerical simulations and real-data analysis.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present error estimates of the fully semi-Lagrangian scheme with high-order interpolation operators, solving the initial value problems for the one-dimensional nonlinear diffusive conservation laws, including the Burgers equations. We impose certain assumptions on the interpolation operator, which are satisfied by both spline and Hermite interpolations. We establish the convergence rates of $ O(\Delta t + h^{2 s} / \Delta t) $ in the $ L^2 $-norm and $ O(\Delta t + h^{s} / (\Delta t)^{1/2} + h^{2s} / \Delta t) $ in the $ H^s $-norm for the spatial mesh size $ h $ and the temporal step size $ \Delta t $, where the spline or Hermite interpolation operator of degree $ (2s - 1) $ is employed. The numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.

In this paper we deal with the initial value problem related to a family of dispersive inhomogeneous evolution equations Pu=f with variable coefficients belonging to the class of p-evolution equations, $p\geq 2$. We study the smoothing effect produced by some spatial decay assumptions on the imaginary part of the subleading coefficient of the linear operator P. Then we apply this result to nonlinear problems with derivative nonlinearities obtaining existence and uniqueness of the solution in a suitable Sobolev class. The nonlinear equations considered include various equations of physical interest such as KdV-type and Kawahara-type equations.

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper is mainly concerned with an initial-boundary value problem of the nonhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with the Landau potential in a two and three dimensions. The existence of strong solutions with bounded and strictly positive density for this system was constructed by Giorgini and Temam \cite{GT}. However, whether uniqueness holds has remained an open question. The present work solves this question and we prove the uniqueness of strong solution. Our method mainly relies on some extra time weighted estimates and the Lagrangian approach.

Meromorphic differentials and twisted DR hierarchies for the Hodge CohFT
Xavier Blot, Paolo Rossi, Adrien Sauvaget
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In [arXiv:2408.13806], two families of classical and quantum integrable hierarchies associated to arbitrary Cohomological Field Theories (CohFTs) were introduced: the meromorphic differential and twisted double ramification hierarchies. For trivial CohFT, the authors established a connection with the untwisted Double Ramification (DR) hierarchy. In this paper, we extend this study to the Hodge CohFT and prove an analogous correspondence with the untwisted DR hierarchy. This yields non-trivial identities between Hodge integrals over the DR cycle, the twisted DR cycle and the cycle of meromorphic differentials.

Functional Liftings of Restricted Geometric Inequalities
Andreas Malliaris, James Melbourne, Cyril Roberto, Michael Roysdon
Subjects:

We investigate what we term ``generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture. We also show that Barthe's reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality is equivalent to the geometric inequality it implies and give a functional formulation of a conjecture of Schneider. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.

Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions
Saúl Burgos, José L. Flores, Miguel Sánchez
Comments:
Updated abstract
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemannian setting, standard pointed convergence is strengthened to anchored convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorentzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness of just inextensibility. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ''Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani--Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on their own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.

WKB structure in a scalar model of flat bands

We consider a family of periodic scalar operators for which one can define flat bands in the sense of Floquet-Bloch theory. One puzzling question originating in recent physics literature is a quantisation rule for the values of parameters at which these flat bands occur. We present a general theorem about the structure of solutions to the corresponding equation and a heuristic argument explaining their WKB structure in a specific case. That structure also explains the quantisation condition - both the WKB structure and that rule are confirmed by numerical experiments. Finally, we consider a simplified model in which separation of variables allows the use of complex WKB methods.

Computations in equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of GKM spaces

Comments:

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
We study equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum cohomology in GKM theory. Building on the localization formula, we prove that the resulting expression is independent of the choice of compatible connection, and provide an equivalent formulation without auxiliary choices. Motivated by this theoretical refinement, we develop a software package, $\mathtt{GKMtools . jl}$, that implements the computation of equivariant GW invariants and quantum products directly from the GKM graph. We apply our framework to several geometric settings: Calabi-Yau rank two vector bundles on the projective line, where we obtain a new proof for a recent connection to Donaldson-Thomas theory of Kronecker quivers; twisted flag manifolds, which give symplectic but non-algebraic examples of GKM spaces; realizability questions for abstract GKM graphs; and classical enumerative problems involving curves in hyperplanes. These results demonstrate both the theoretical flexibility of GKM methods and the effectiveness of computational tools in exploring new phenomena.

Quantum equations for knots
Thomas Fiedler, Butian Zhang
Comments:

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
This paper contains linear systems of equations which can distinguish knots without knot invariants.
Let $M_n$ be the topological moduli space of all n-component string links and such that a fixed projection into the plane is an immersion. If a string link is the product of some string link diagram $T$ and the parallel n-cable of a framed long knot diagram $D$, then there is a canonical arc $push$ in $M_n$, defined by pushing $T$ through the n-cable of $D$. In this paper we apply the combinatorial 1-cocycles from the HOMFLYPT and Kauffman polynomials in $M_n$ with values in the corresponding skein modules to this canonical arc in $M_n$. Some of the 1-cocycles lead to linear systems of equations in the skein modules, for each couple of diagrams $D$ and $D'$. If the system has no solution in the Laurent polynomials then $D$ and $D'$ represent different knots. We give first examples where we distinguish knots without any knot invariants. In particular, we distinguish the knot $9_{42}$ from its mirror image with equations coming from the HOMFLYPT polynomial. Notice that the knot $9_{42}$ and its mirror image share the same HOMFLYPT polynomial.
On the other hand, each solution of the system gives rather fine information about any regular isotopy which connects $D$ with $D'$.

Comments:

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce and extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors and matrices, and present some identities in terms of these products. We offer tensor expressions of derivatives of tensors, focus on the tensor forms of derivatives of a matrix w.r.t. another matrix. This tensor form makes possible for us to unify ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with partial differential equations (PDEs), and facilitates solution to them in some cases. For our purpose, we also extend the outer product and contractive product of tensors (matrices) to a more general case through any partition of the modes, present some identities in terms of these products, initialize the definition of partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) of a tensor, and use the partial TuckD to simplify the PDEs. We also present a tensor form for the Lyapunov function. Our results in the products of tensors and matrices help us to establish some important equalities on the derivatives of matrices and tensors. An algorithm based on the partial Tucker decompositions (TuckD) to solve the PDEs is given, and a numerical example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.

Random data Cauchy theory for fully nonlocal telegraph equations
Xi Huang, Li Peng, Juan Carlos Pozo, Yong Zhou
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the random Cauchy problem for the fully nonlocal telegraph equation of power type with the general $(\mathcal{PC}^{\ast})$ type kernel $(a,b)$. This equation can effectively characterize high-frequency signal transmission in small-scale systems. We establish a new completely positive kernel induced by $b$ (see Appendix \refeq{app b}) and derive two novel solution operators by using the relaxation functions associated with the new kernel,which are closely related to the operators $\cos(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ and $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{\beta}{4} }\sin(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ for $\beta\in(1,2]$. These operators enable, for the first time, the derivation of mixed-norm $L_t^qL_x^{p'}$ estimates for the novel solution operators. Next, utilizing probabilistic randomization methods, we establish the average effects, the local existence and uniqueness for a large set of initial data $u^\omega \in L^{2}(\Omega, H^{s,p}(\mathbb R^3))$ ($p\in (1,2)$) while also obtaining probabilistic estimates for local existence under randomized initial conditions. The results reveal a critical phenomenon in the temporal regularity of the solution regarding the regularity index $s$ of the initial data $u^\omega$.

Remarks on proper conflict-free degree-choosability of graphs with prescribed degeneracy

Comments:
7 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2509.06280
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ is called a proper conflict-free coloring of $G$ if for every non-isolated vertex $v$ of $G$, there is a color $c$ such that $|\phi^{-1}(c)\cap N_G(v)|=1$. As an analogy of degree-choosability of graphs, we introduced the notion of proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$ of $G$ with $|L(v)|\geq d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$, $G$ admits a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. In this note, we first remark if a graph $G$ is $d$-degenerate, then $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+d+1)$-choosable. Furthermore, when $d=1$, we can reduce the number of colors by showing that every tree is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+1)$-choosable. This motivates us to state a question.

Accelerated Gradient Methods with Biased Gradient Estimates: Risk Sensitivity, High-Probability Guarantees, and Large Deviation Bounds
Mert Gürbüzbalaban, Yasa Syed, Necdet Serhat Aybat
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We study trade-offs between convergence rate and robustness to gradient errors in the context of first-order methods. Our focus is on generalized momentum methods (GMMs)--a broad class that includes Nesterov's accelerated gradient, heavy-ball, and gradient descent methods--for minimizing smooth strongly convex objectives. We allow stochastic gradient errors that may be adversarial and biased, and quantify robustness of these methods to gradient errors via the risk-sensitive index (RSI) from robust control theory. For quadratic objectives with i.i.d. Gaussian noise, we give closed form expressions for RSI in terms of solutions to 2x2 matrix Riccati equations, revealing a Pareto frontier between RSI and convergence rate over the choice of step-size and momentum parameters. We then prove a large-deviation principle for time-averaged suboptimality in the large iteration limit and show that the rate function is, up to a scaling, the convex conjugate of the RSI function. We further show that the rate function and RSI are linked to the $H_\infty$-norm--a measure of robustness to the worst-case deterministic gradient errors--so that stronger worst-case robustness (smaller $H_\infty$-norm) leads to sharper decay of the tail probabilities for the average suboptimality. Beyond quadratics, under potentially biased sub-Gaussian gradient errors, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on a finite-time analogue of the RSI, yielding finite-time high-probability guarantees and non-asymptotic large-deviation bounds for the averaged iterates. In the case of smooth strongly convex functions, we also observe an analogous trade-off between RSI and convergence-rate bounds. To our knowledge, these are the first non-asymptotic guarantees for GMMs with biased gradients and the first risk-sensitive analysis of GMMs. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on a robust regression problem to illustrate our results.

Title:
A Parameterized Control Representation of G-Expectations
Guangqian Zhao
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper proposes a novel perspective that connects the abstract framework of $G$-expectation to a concrete parameterized family of classical stochastic processes, offering a unified viewpoint for nonlinear stochastic calculus under model uncertainty. We demonstrate that $G$-Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations (G-SDEs) can be effectively interpreted as controlled processes $\{B_t^{\theta}\}_{\theta}$, where $\theta$ denotes an admissible control process taking values in a compact convex parameter set $\Theta$ encoding volatility uncertainty.
The core contribution is the construction of a correspondence that preserves key operations, including addition, multiplication, function composition, and limit transitions. This perspective provides an alternative mathematical interpretation for understanding $G$-martingales, leading to a natural distinction between symmetric martingales (fair in all volatility scenarios) and asymmetric martingales (favorable but fair only in the worst-case scenario).
We develop a methodology for solving G-SDEs through their parameterized representations, establishing existence and uniqueness results under standard Lipschitz and growth conditions. The framework illustrates how bounded control sets preserve these classical conditions while capturing volatility ambiguity.
The parameterized control perspective offers both mathematical insight and computational practicality, facilitating the transfer of classical stochastic calculus results into the $G$-expectation framework while maintaining its essential sublinear structure.

Monochromatic 4-AP avoidance in $2$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for primes $5 \le p \le 997$

We study $2$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ that avoid monochromatic $4$-term arithmetic progressions for every step $d$ with $p\nmid d$. We completely classify all primes $5\le p\le 997$: such a coloring exists if and only if $p\in\{5,7,11\}$. For larger primes, nonexistence is consistent with lower bounds of Wolf and Lu-Peng on the number of monochromatic 4-APs in $2$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ [10,7]. When solutions exist, the minimal period equals $p$, and we enumerate them up to dihedral symmetries and global color swap. The proofs combine residue class checks with small structural observations and SAT certificates for nonexistence [9,5]. All scripts and proof logs are provided for exact reproduction.

Beam Squint Assisted Joint Angle-Distance Localization for Near-Field Communications
Aibiao Zhang, Weizheng Zhang, Chiya Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
With the advent of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), mmWave/THz bands and ultra-wideband transmission, future 6G systems demand real-time positioning with centimeter or even millimeter level accuracy. This paper addresses the pronounced near-field beam squint problem caused by phase shifter based beamforming in wideband near-field scenarios and proposes a beam squint assisted joint angle-distance localization scheme. The key idea is to employ true-time-delay (TTD) units together with phase shifters (PS) to synthesize a controllable joint angle-distance (JAD) trajectory that establishes a unique mapping between subcarriers and spatial locations, enabling single scan acquisition of target angle and range. To implement this paradigm efficiently, we design a coarse to fine two stage estimator: a low complexity coarse stage based on subcarrier power peaks for user separation and candidate region selection, followed by a local high resolution refinement stage that applies spatial smoothing and near-field multiple signal classification (MUSIC) over multiple subcarriers and fuses the resulting spectra by geometric averaging to suppress spurious peaks. We theoretically prove the correctness and uniqueness of the MUSIC spatial spectrum peak under the proposed near-field steering model, and derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for joint angle-distance estimation. Simulation results in single and multi-user scenarios validate that the proposed method achieves very high accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming conventional two-step approaches, and is promising for practical 6G sensing and localization deployments.

Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space
Wenyan Ma, Lipeng Zhu, Rui Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.

This work focuses on a class of stochastic Hamiltonian type jump diffusion systems with state-dependent switching, in which the switching component has countably infinite many states. First,the existence and uniqueness of the underlying processes are obtained with the aid of successive construction methods. Then, the Feller property is established by coupling methods. Furthermore, the strong Feller property is proved by introducing some auxiliary processes and making use of appropriate Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Finally, on the basis of the above results, the exponential ergodicity is obtained under the Foster-Lyapunov drift condition.

The Integral Chow Rings of the Moduli Stacks of Hyperelliptic Prym Pairs III

Comments:

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
This paper is the third and final part of a series devoted to the description of the integral Chow rings of the moduli stacks of hyperelliptic Prym pairs. For a fixed genus $g$, there are two natural stacks, $\mathcal{RH}_g$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g$, parametrizing hyperelliptic Prym pairs, with the former being the $\mu_2$-rigidification of the latter. Both decompose as the disjoint union of $\lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$ components, denoted $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n$ for $n = 1, \ldots, \lfloor (g+1)/2 \rfloor$. In this paper we present quotient stack descriptions of the components $\mathcal{RH}_g^n$ for even $g$ and compute their integral Chow rings, thereby completing the computation for all irreducible components of $\mathcal{RH}_g$. In addition, we give quotient stack presentations for all irreducible components of $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g$ and determine when the rigidification map $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n \to \mathcal{RH}_g^n$ is a root gerbe. We then use this to compute the Chow rings of $\widetilde{\mathcal{RH}}_g^n$ for all $g$ and $n$, with the sole exception of the case where $g$ is odd and $n=(g+1)/2$.
Finally, in the appendix, we discuss $G$-gerbes induced by an homomorphism of abelian groups $H \to G$ and an $H$-gerbe.

Measuring agreement among several raters classifying subjects into one or more (hierarchical) categories: A generalization of Fleiss' kappa

Cohen's and Fleiss' kappa are well-known measures of inter-rater agreement, but they restrict each rater to selecting only one category per subject. This limitation is consequential in contexts where subjects may belong to multiple categories, such as psychiatric diagnoses involving multiple disorders or classifying interview snippets into multiple codes of a codebook. We propose a generalized version of Fleiss' kappa, which accommodates multiple raters assigning subjects to one or more nominal categories. Our proposed $\kappa$ statistic can incorporate category weights based on their importance and account for hierarchical category structures, such as primary disorders with sub-disorders. The new $\kappa$ statistic can also manage missing data and variations in the number of raters per subject or category. We review existing methods that allow for multiple category assignments and detail the derivation of our measure, proving its equivalence to Fleiss' kappa when raters select a single category per subject. The paper discusses the assumptions, premises, and potential paradoxes of the new measure, as well as the range of possible values and guidelines for interpretation. The measure was developed to investigate the reliability of a new mathematics assessment method, of which an example is elaborated. The paper concludes with a worked-out example of psychiatrists diagnosing patients with multiple disorders. All calculations are provided as R script and an Excel sheet to facilitate access to the new $\kappa$ tatistic.

Causal inference for the expected number of recurrent events in the presence of a terminal event

Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
While recurrent event analyses have been extensively studied, limited attention has been given to causal inference within the framework of recurrent event analysis. We develop a multiply robust estimation framework for causal inference in recurrent event data with a terminal failure event. We define our estimand as the vector comprising both the expected number of recurrent events and the failure survival function evaluated along a sequence of landmark times. We show that the estimand can be identified under a weaker condition than conditionally independent censoring and derive the associated class of influence functions under general censoring and failure distributions (i.e., without assuming absolute continuity). We propose a particular estimator within this class for further study, conduct comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the small-sample performance of our estimator, and illustrate the proposed estimator using a large Medicare dataset to assess the causal effect of PM$_{2.5}$ on recurrent cardiovascular hospitalization.

We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains Q-balls/shells, which are non-topological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, Q-shells can shelter another compact Q-ball or Q-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multi-compacton formations is affected by electric charge. We are interested in structures with non-zero or zero total net charge.

Autoregressive generative models play a key role in various language tasks, especially for modeling and evaluating long text sequences. While recent methods leverage stochastic representations to better capture sequence dynamics, encoding both temporal and structural dependencies and utilizing such information for evaluation remains challenging. In this work, we observe that fitting transformer-based model embeddings into a stochastic process yields ordered latent representations from originally unordered model outputs. Building on this insight and prior work, we theoretically introduce a novel likelihood-based evaluation metric BBScoreV2. Empirically, we demonstrate that the stochastic latent space induces a "clustered-to-temporal ordered" mapping of language model representations in high-dimensional space, offering both intuitive and quantitative support for the effectiveness of BBScoreV2. Furthermore, this structure aligns with intrinsic properties of natural language and enhances performance on tasks such as temporal consistency evaluation (e.g., Shuffle tasks) and AI-generated content detection.

A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions

Subjects:
Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We mathematically model Smectic-A (SmA) phases with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The orientational order of the SmA phase is described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which models the deviation from the average density of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of global minimisers of the mLdG free energy in three-dimensional settings. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can capture the Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition as a function of temperature, under some assumptions. Further, we explore stable smectic phases on a square domain, with edge length $\lambda$, and tangent boundary conditions. We use heuristic arguments to show that defects repel smectic layers and strong nematic ordering promotes layer formation. We use asymptotic arguments in the $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$ limits which reveal the correlation between the number and thickness of smectic layers, the amplitude of density fluctuations with the phenomenological parameters in the mLdG energy. For finite values of $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like stable smectic states observed in experiments. We also study the frustrated mLdG energy landscape and give numerical examples of transition pathways between distinct mLdG energy minimisers.

Beyond Monads and Biproducts: A Uniform Interpretation of Parallelism in Intuitionistic Logic

Comments:
16 pages plus appendix
Subjects:
Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO); Category Theory (math.CT)
Traditional approaches to modelling parallelism and algebraic structure in lambda calculi often rely on monads$\unicode{x2013}$as in Moggi's framework$\unicode{x2013}$or on rich categorical structures such as biproducts$\unicode{x2013}$as used in certain models of linear logic. In this work, we propose a minimal alternative that captures both parallelism and weighted parallelism (linear combinations) within the setting of intuitionistic propositional logic, without resorting to monads or assuming the existence of biproducts.
We introduce two lambda calculi: a parallel lambda calculus and an algebraic lambda calculus, both extending full propositional intuitionistic logic. Their semantics are given in two categories: ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and arrows are functions in $\mathbf{Set}$; and ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas.
The key technical challenge addressed is the interpretation of disjunction in the presence of parallel and algebraic operators. Since the usual coproduct structure is unavailable in our minimal setting, we propose a novel set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product. This allows for the construction of sound and adequate models for both calculi.
Our results offer a unified and structurally lightweight framework for modelling parallelism and algebraic effects in intuitionistic logic, opening the way to alternatives beyond the traditional monadic or linear logic approaches.

Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.

The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.

Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.

All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination: Robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Which quantum phenomena are advantageous for information processing tasks? By classifying quantum states as resourceful versus non-resourceful, or free, the mathematical formalism of quantum resource theories helps to address such questions. For the task of discriminating channels applied to a probe state, it has been shown that under certain conditions -- namely, the set of free states being convex or finite dimensional -- every resourceful probe state can provide an advantage, quantified by a resource monotone known as generalized robustness. In this work, bypassing the limitations of previous studies, we define the generalized robustness for an arbitrary resource theory and show that it admits two operational interpretations. Firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in channel discrimination tasks implemented on multiple copies of the probe states. Secondly, in many physically relevant theories, it quantifies the advantage in single-copy channel discrimination tasks in a worst case scenario. We further present a general construction of multi-copy resource witnesses and provide practical methods to bound the generalized robustness in experiments. Finally, we apply our results to a key case study in continuous variable quantum information: the resource theory of non-Gaussianity. This theory is naturally defined by a set of free states (Gaussian states) that is non-convex and infinite-dimensional. Our work then shows conclusively that all non-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination task, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states and are typically disregarded for other quantum information tasks. To illustrate our findings, we provide exact formulas for the robustness of non-Gaussianity of Fock states, along with an analysis of the robustness for a family of non-Gaussian states within the convex hull of Gaussian states.

Building upon [2308.02636], we investigate the constraining power of persistent homology on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity in a likelihood-free inference pipeline utilizing machine learning. We evaluate the ability of Persistence Images (PIs) to infer parameters, comparing them to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS). We also compare two classes of models: neural-based and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS for parameters that can be constrained, i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$. PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, highlighting the potential of persistent homology for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results indicate that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little additional or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ is additionally informed by filaments (1-cycles).

Model-Free and Real-Time Unicycle-Based Source Seeking with Differential Wheeled Robotic Experiments

Subjects:
Robotics (cs.RO); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Many autonomous robots aimed at source-seeking are studied, and their controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.

We introduce a novel framework for decomposing interventional causal effects into synergistic, redundant, and unique components, building on the intuition of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the principle of Möbius inversion. While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an observational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the Möbius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, chemical reaction networks, and a transformer language model. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. The decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models.

We theoretically analyzed the convergence behavior of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) and found that using an increasing batch size leads to faster convergence than using a constant batch size, not only with a constant learning rate but also with a decaying learning rate, such as cosine annealing decay and polynomial decay. The convergence rate improves from $O(T^{-1}+C)$ with a constant batch size to $O(T^{-1})$ with an increasing batch size, where $T$ denotes the total number of iterations and $C$ is a constant. Using principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion, we investigated, both theoretically and numerically, how an increasing batch size affects computational time as quantified by stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. An increasing batch size was found to reduce the SFO complexity of RSGD. Furthermore, an increasing batch size was found to offer the advantages of both small and large constant batch sizes.

Analog In-memory Training on General Non-ideal Resistive Elements: The Impact of Response Functions

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Hardware Architecture (cs.AR); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. While the conductance changes by a constant in response to each pulse, in reality, the change is scaled by asymmetric and non-linear \textit{response functions}, leading to a non-ideal training dynamic. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on AIMC hardware with non-ideal response functions. We demonstrate that asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by imposing an implicit penalty on the objective. To overcome the issue, we propose Residual Learning algorithm, which provably converges exactly to a critical point by solving a bilevel optimization problem. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be extended to address other hardware imperfections, such as limited response granularity. As we know, it is the first paper to investigate the impact of a class of generic non-ideal response functions. The conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights.

Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporally satisfying reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph at each time-step.
We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input temporal graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.

Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.

Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a new formulation of the problem based on the \emph{belief propagation (BP) channel}, namely a completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) map that realizes local perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we prove that establishing the quasi-locality of BP channels implies the decay of CMI, thereby reducing the original conjecture to a more tractable problem. We show that such quasi-local BP channels can be constructed under natural physical conditions, such as uniform rapid mixing or uniform clustering. Under these assumptions, we obtain conditional proofs of CMI decay valid at all temperatures. Moreover, because these assumptions are automatically satisfied at high temperatures, our results in that regime yield unconditional proofs of CMI decay. At the same time, in order to better understand the high-temperature behavior of Gibbs states, we revisit the cluster expansion method. Contrary to common intuition, we demonstrate that when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered, the cluster expansion suffers from intrinsic divergence problems rooted in the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula, revealing fundamental limitations of this traditional approach.

Gradient-Free Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design via Interacting Particle Systems

Subjects:
Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Computation (stat.CO)
We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.

Gaussian process policy iteration with additive Schwarz acceleration for forward and inverse HJB and mean field game problems
Xianjin Yang, Jingguo Zhang
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose a Gaussian Process (GP)-based policy iteration framework for addressing both forward and inverse problems in Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations and mean field games (MFGs). Policy iteration is formulated as an alternating procedure between solving the value function under a fixed control policy and updating the policy based on the resulting value function. By exploiting the linear structure of GPs for function approximation, each policy evaluation step admits an explicit closed-form solution, eliminating the need for numerical optimization. To improve convergence, we incorporate the additive Schwarz acceleration as a preconditioning step following each policy update. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Schwarz acceleration in improving computational efficiency.

Lindblad evolution as gradient flow

Subjects:

We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the complex $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the real $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.

Near-field-free super-potential FFT method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation

Comments:
15 pages, 2 figure
Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a spectrally accurate, efficient FFT-based method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources. The method adopts a super-potential formulation: we first compute the convolution with the biharmonic Green's function, then recover the potential by spectral differentiation, applying the Laplacian in Fourier space. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient precomputation and quasi-linear, FFT-based convolution. Owing to the biharmonic kernel's improved regularity, the GS cutoff error is fourth-order, uniform for all target points, eliminating the near-field corrections and Taylor expansions required in standard GS/Ewald-type methods. Benchmarks on Gaussian, oscillatory, and compactly supported densities reach the double-precision limit and, at matched accuracy on the same hardware, reduce both error and per-solve runtime relative to our original GS-based scheme. The resulting method is simple, reproducible, and efficient for three-dimensional free-space Poisson problems with smooth sources on uniform grids.

k-Planar and Fan-Crossing Drawings and Transductions of Planar Graphs
Petr Hliněný, Jan Jedelský
Subjects:
Computational Geometry (cs.CG); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We introduce a two-way connection between FO transductions (first-order logical transformations) of planar graphs, and a certain variant of fan-crossing (fan-planar) drawings of graphs which for bounded-degree graphs essentially reduces to being k-planar for fixed k. For graph classes, this connection allows to derive non-transducibility results from nonexistence of the said drawings and, conversely, from nonexistence of a transduction to derive nonexistence of the said drawings. For example, the class of 3D-grids is not k-planar for any fixed k. We hope that this connection will help to draw a path to a possible proof that not all toroidal graphs are transducible from planar graphs.
Our characterization can be extended to any fixed surface instead of the plane. The result is based on a very recent characterization of weakly sparse FO transductions of classes of bounded expansion by [Gajarský, Gładkowski, Jedelský, Pilipczuk and Toruńczyk, arXiv:2505.15655].

Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurements of packing density. We introduce this http URL, an open-source Julia package providing analytic partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centred cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. this http URL converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and scales linearly with particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). this http URL provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.

Asymptotia of Kerr-de Sitter Black Holes

Exterior geometries of physical black holes are believed to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter spacetime at late times. A characteristic feature of that vacuum Einstein solution is the presence of a hidden symmetry generated by a closed conformal Killing--Yano tensor. Using this symmetry and modern conformal geometry technology, we find necessary conditions for generic solutions to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter metric. Further, we constrain the admissible form of the geometric free data on the conformal infinity giving rise to this family of spacetimes and constrain it in terms of the stress-energy tensor.

Both Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence of Quasi-Hyperbolic Momentum using Increasing Batch Size

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Momentum methods were originally introduced for their superiority to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in deterministic settings with convex objective functions. However, despite their widespread application to deep neural networks -- a representative case of stochastic nonconvex optimization -- the theoretical justification for their effectiveness in such settings remains limited. Quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QHM) is an algorithm that generalizes various momentum methods and has been studied to better understand the class of momentum-based algorithms as a whole. In this paper, we provide both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence results for mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size. We show that achieving asymptotic convergence requires either a decaying learning rate or an increasing batch size. Since a decaying learning rate adversely affects non-asymptotic convergence, we demonstrate that using mini-batch QHM with an increasing batch size -- without decaying the learning rate -- can be a more effective strategy. Our experiments show that even a finite increase in batch size can provide benefits for training neural networks.

In recent papers [1,2], a new method to cross the natural boundary has been proposed, and applied to Mordell-Borel integrals arising in the study of Chern-Simons theory, based on decompositions into {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}. Resurgent analysis on the Stokes line leads to a unique transseries decomposition in terms of unary false theta functions, which can be continued across the natural boundary to produce dual $q$-series whose integer-valued coefficients enumerate BPS states. This constitutes a deeper new manifestation of resurgence in quantum field theoretic path integrals. In this paper we show that the algebraic structure of the {\it resurgent cyclic orbits}, combined with just the leading term of the $q$-series, completely determines the large order rate of growth of the dual $q$-series coefficients. The essential exponent of this asymptotic growth has a Cardy-like interpretation [10] of an effective central charge in a 3 dimensional quantum field theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry related to the Chern-Simons theory through the $3d$-$3d$ correspondence.

This paper investigates the relationship between the Number of Degrees of Freedom ($N_{\rm DoF}$) of the field in deterministic and stochastic source models within Electromagnetic Information Theory (EIT). Our findings demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two approaches. Specifically, we show that a deterministic model and a stochastic model with a spatially incoherent and homogeneous source yield not only the same $N_{\rm DoF}$ but also identical eigenvalues and basis functions for field representation. This key equivalence not only explains the effectiveness of deterministic approaches in EIT but also corroborates the use of classical electromagnetic methods within this new discipline.

Block Encoding of Sparse Matrices via Coherent Permutation
Abhishek Setty
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Block encoding of sparse matrices underpins powerful quantum algorithms such as quantum singular value transformation, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum linear solvers, but its efficient gate-level implementation for arbitrary sparse matrices remains a major challenge. We introduce a unified framework that overcomes the key obstacles of multi-controlled X gates overhead, amplitude reordering, and hardware connectivity, enabling efficient block encoding for arbitrary sparse matrices with explicit gate-level constructions. Central to our approach are a novel connection with combinatorial optimization, which enables systematic assignment of control qubits to achieve nearest-neighbor connectivity, and coherent permutation operators that preserve superposition while enabling amplitude reordering. We demonstrate our methods on structured sparse matrices, showing significant reductions in circuit depth and control overhead, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical formulations and practical circuit implementations for quantum algorithms.

Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order

Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.

PBPK-iPINNs: Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Brain Models

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) leverage machine learning with differential equations to solve direct and inverse problems, ensuring predictions follow physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points) must be carefully tuned. The performance of the PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established traditional numerical and statistical methods.

LiMuon: Light and Fast Muon Optimizer for Large Models
Feihu Huang, Yuning Luo, Songcan Chen
Comments:
28 pages
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Large models recently are widely applied in artificial intelligence, so efficient training of large models has received widespread attention. More recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models, which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition. Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.
