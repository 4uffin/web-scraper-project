Title:
$C^1$ perturbations of a continuum of critical points
Rafael Ortega, Antonio J. Urena
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Given a real valued function having a nondegenerate compact manifold of critical points, some of these points survive under small $C^2$ perturbations. This is a well-known result in critical point theory. In 1986 Weinstein obtained the analogous conclusions when the perturbation is only $C^2$ and the ambient space is a finite dimensional manifold. In this work we present a complete proof for $C^1$ perturbations in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Title:
Generalized probabilistic approximation characteristic based on Birkhoff orthogonality and related conclusions in $S_{\infty}$-norm
Weiye Zhang, Chong Wang, Huan Li
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
In this article, we generalize the definition of the probabilistic Gel'fand width from the Hilbert space to the strictly convex reflexive space by giving Birkhoff left orthogonal decomposition theorem. Meanwhile, a more natural definition of Gel'fand width in the classical setting is selected to make sure probabilistic and average Gel'fand widths will not lose their meaning, so that we can give the equality relation between the probabilistic Gel'fand width and the probabilistic linear width of the Hilbert space. Meanwhile, we use this relationship to continue the study of the Gel'fand widths of the univariate Sobolev space and the multivariate Sobolev space, especially in $S_{\infty}$-norm, and determine the exact order of probabilistic and average Gel'fand widths.

Title:
A Novel Extension of $S$-Metric Spaces with Application to Solving $n$th-Degree Polynomial Equations
Nizar Souayah
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
This paper introduces a novel generalization of the classical concept of $S$-metric spaces, referred to as composed $S$-metric spaces. By incorporating a composed function, we impose more general conditions on the triangle inequality, extending the traditional framework. Using this newly defined structure, we establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points under suitable assumptions. Our results expand upon and generalize several established results in the literature across various types of spaces. To highlight the practical significance of our findings, we provide an example that demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results. This examples highlight the versatility and effectiveness of composed $S$-metric spaces in a range of mathematical contexts, particularly in solving $n$th degree polynomial equations.

Cycling Along Euler Road

7 pages, 2 figures. Preliminary version, comments welcome
Subjects:
History and Overview (math.HO); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
We introduce the notion of $P_{\lambda}$ points, which canonically parametrize points on the Euler line. This allows us to show that the Euler line of any inscribed $n$-polytope in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space arises from the Euler lines of its facets, beginning from the Euler line of a point in the plane. Furthermore, we situate $P_{\lambda}$ points in the literature of modern triangle centers.

Bilevel subsidy-enabled mobility hub network design with perturbed utility coalitional choice-based assignment
Hai Yang, Joseph Y. J. Chow
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); General Economics (econ.GN)
Urban mobility is undergoing rapid transformation with the emergence of new services. Mobility hubs (MHs) have been proposed as physical-digital convergence points, offering a range of public and private mobility options in close proximity. By supporting Mobility-as-a-Service, these hubs can serve as focal points where travel decisions intersect with operator strategies. We develop a bilevel MH platform design model that treats MHs as control levers. The upper level (platform) maximizes revenue or flow by setting subsidies to incentivize last-mile operators; the lower level captures joint traveler-operator decisions with a link-based Perturbed Utility Route Choice (PURC) assignment, yielding a strictly convex quadratic program. We reformulate the bilevel problem to a single-level program via the KKT conditions of the lower level and solve it with a gap-penalty method and an iterative warm-start scheme that exploits the computationally cheap lower-level problem. Numerical experiments on a toy network and a Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) case (244 nodes, 469 links, 78 ODs) show that the method attains sub-1% optimality gaps in minutes. In the base LIRR case, the model allows policymakers to quantify the social surplus value of a MH, or the value of enabling subsidy or regulating the microtransit operator's pricing. Comparing link-based subsidies to hub-based subsidies, the latter is computationally more expensive but offers an easier mechanism for comparison and control.

Bluffing in Scrabble
Nick Ballard, Timothy Y. Chow
Comments:

Subjects:
History and Overview (math.HO); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
It is well known that in games with imperfect information, such as poker, bluffing with some probability can be a component of the optimal strategy. However, as far as we know, nobody has ever exhibited a Scrabble position in which the optimal strategy involves bluffing, or even a Scrabble position in which the optimal strategy is a mixed (i.e., randomized) strategy. We present a carefully constructed Scrabble position, that could actually arise in a tournament game with no invalid words played, in which the optimal strategy (assuming that a tied score leads to the point being split equally, with no recourse to so-called "spread points" as a tie-breaking mechanism) is to make Move A with probability 1/3 and to make Move B with probability 2/3. Move B can reasonably be called a bluff, in the sense that it sets up a threat which the player cannot in fact execute, but which the opponent may not be able to rule out.

Title:
Linear Equations for Solving Partial Latin Squares and Sudokus
Ralf Pöppel
Comments:
20 pages, includes examples, Octave source code available on GitHub
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
For Latin squares the units (rows and columns) have fixed sum. The same holds for rows, columns, and blocks in Sudokus. Summing the elements of a unit yields a linear equation, and the set of all such equations forms a system of linear equations that models the relations of the variables in Latin squares and Sudoku puzzles. Every completed Latin square or Sudoku satisfies this system, enabling analysis and completion of partially filled puzzles. The linear system provides necessary but not sufficient conditions for a solution. We analyze the structure and rank of these systems and establish limits on their ability to uniquely determine solutions. For Latin squares of size $n \times n$ with $k$ unknowns and Sudokus with block size $n = m \cdot l$, the system has full rank only if \[ k \leq 2n - 1 \quad \text{(Latin squares)}, \qquad k \leq 2n - 1 + (l - 1)(m - 1) \quad \text{(Sudokus)}. \] These conditions are necessary for uniqueness under the linear model, though counterexamples exist. We also highlight that this system captures only one of the three relations known to puzzle solvers, requiring extensions with additional (nonlinear) constraints for complete solutions. Our analysis shows that certain partial Latin squares and Sudokus can be solved in polynomial time using Gaussian elimination, placing them in complexity class P, while the general completion problem remains NP-complete.

Vizings Conjecture: A Density-Based Re-framing
Noah Hosking
Comments:
5 pages, 0 figures
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We recast Vizing's conjecture \gamma(G \square H) \ge \gamma(G)\gamma(H) through a simple domination-density lens. Defining \rho_X = \gamma(X)/|V(X)|, the conjecture becomes \rho_{G \square H} \ge \rho_G \rho_H. Many classical estimates admit this normalized form; if we select valid upper bounds \rho_G \le \tilde\rho_G, \rho_H \le \tilde\rho_H and a product lower bound \rho_{G \square H} \ge \tilde\rho_{G \square H}, then the single test \tilde\rho_{G \square H} \ge \tilde\rho_G \tilde\rho_H certifies Vizing's. Instantiations include: (i) a bipartite imbalance criterion, where partition asymmetry together with a maximum-degree bound yields infinite nontrivial families; and (ii) a regular high-degree regime via the Arnautov-Payan bound, certifying all k-regular pairs for k \ge 32. The framework is modular: sharper family-specific bounds can be dropped in without altering the proof, expanding the certified regime while preserving the simple density form.

Title:
Asymptotic stability properties and a priori bounds for Adam and other gradient descent optimization methods
Steffen Dereich, Robin Graeber, Arnulf Jentzen, Adrian Riekert
Comments:
60 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Gradient descent (GD) based optimization methods are these days the standard tools to train deep neural networks in artificial intelligence systems. In optimization procedures in deep learning the employed optimizer is often not the standard GD method but instead suitable adaptive and accelerated variants of standard GD (including the momentum and the root mean square propagation (RMSprop) optimizers) are considered. The adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimizer proposed in 2014 by Kingma \& Ba is presumably the most popular variant of such adaptive and accelerated GD based optimization methods. Despite the popularity of such sophisticated optimization methods, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to provide a rigorous mathematical analysis for such accelerated and adaptive optimization methods. In particular, it remains an open problem of research to establish boundedness of the Adam optimizer. In this work we solve this problem in the case of a simple class of quadratic strongly convex stochastic optimization problems. Specifically, for the considered class of stochastic optimization problems we reveal a priori bounds for momentum, RMSprop, and Adam. In particular, we prove for the considered class of strongly convex stochastic optimization problems, for the first time, that Adam does not explode but stays bounded for any choices of the learning rates. In this work we also introduce certain stability concepts - such as the notion of the stability region - for deep learning optimizers and we discover that among standard GD, momentum, RMSprop, and Adam we have that Adam is the only optimizer that achieves the optimal higher order convergence speed and also has the maximal stability region.

Title:
Indigenous Beadwork as a Method of Teaching Linear Algebra
Sarah Plosker, Cathy Mattes
Comments:
This is a "working paper"; the final version will be published in Native American and Indigenous Studies Journal, published by the University of Minnesota Press, and in partnership with NAISA--the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association, in Fall 2025
Subjects:
History and Overview (math.HO)
In this work, the authors describe efforts aimed at Indigenizing a second-year linear algebra course at a small liberal arts university in Manitoba, Canada. This is done through an assignment, part hands-on and part written work, that explores the connection between Indigenous beadwork and linear algebra. Our collaboration was perhaps unconventional: Sarah, the first author, is a mathematics professor; while Cathy, the second author, is an associate professor in art history. However, we both had similar goals of putting theory into practice and making positive changes to student learning outcomes in a culturally appropriate way. We situate our work in the context of the current scholarly literature, adding to the important ongoing dialogue on Indigenization of course content and reflecting on the process and outcomes. This transformation of the course curriculum represented an applied approach to immerse Indigenous knowledge and pedagogy into a mathematics classroom. We hope that it may serve as an example of how other educators, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), can integrate Indigenous knowledge-centered pedagogy into their classroom.

Title:
Simultaneous Novelty from First-Appearance Times in the Calkin-Wilf Enumeration
Paul Alexander Bilokon
Comments:
4 pages
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We study the first-appearance map $\pi:\mathbb{N}_{\ge2}\to\mathbb{N}_0$ that assigns to each denominator $d$ the earliest breadth-first index at which a reduced fraction of denominator $d$ occurs in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$. In parallel, we consider the elementary denominator-first array $D=\big(U(2)\mid U(3)\mid U(4)\mid\cdots\big)$ with rows $U(a)=(1/a,2/a,\dots,(a-1)/a)$ and row-starts $i_0(a)=\frac{(a-2)(a-1)}{2}$. We say level $a$ locks if $\pi(a)=i_0(a)$. Our main theorem is purely combinatorial: for every $n\ge2$ there exists $i\in\{0,\dots,n-2\}$ such that the first appearances of denominators $n-i$ and $n+i$ align symmetrically around $i_0(n)$, i.e.\ $\pi(n\pm i)=i_0(n)\pm i$. We prove this pairing (or simultaneous novelty) theorem via a local-coherence analysis of $\pi$ around a level and a discrete intermediate-value argument. An equivalent group-theoretic restatement uses the free monoid $\langle L,R\rangle\subset SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ underlying the Calkin-Wilf and Stern-Brocot trees.

A Deep Learning Framework for Joint Channel Acquisition and Communication Optimization in Movable Antenna Systems
Ruizhi Zhang, Yuchen Zhang, Lipeng Zhu, Ying Zhang, Rui Zhang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
This paper presents an end-to-end deep learning framework in a movable antenna (MA)-enabled multiuser communication system. In contrast to the conventional works assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), we address the practical CSI acquisition issue through the design of pilot signals and quantized CSI feedback, and further incorporate the joint optimization of channel estimation, MA placement, and precoding design. The proposed mechanism enables the system to learn an optimized transmission strategy from imperfect channel data, overcoming the limitations of conventional methods that conduct channel estimation and antenna position optimization separately. To balance the performance and overhead, we further extend the proposed framework to optimize the antenna placement based on the statistical CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional benchmarks in terms of achievable sum-rate of users, especially under limited feedback and sparse channel environments. Notably, it achieves a performance comparable to the widely-adopted gradient-based methods with perfect CSI, while maintaining significantly lower CSI feedback overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of learning-based MA system design for future wireless systems.

Relation-Theoretic Banach Contraction Principle in Topological Spaces with an Application
Md Hasanuzzaman, Abhishikta Das, Sumit Som
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
In this article, we extend several relation-theoretic notions to topological spaces. We introduce relation preserving contraction mapping into topological spaces and utilize the same to extend Banach contraction principle in topological spaces employing a binary relation. To illustrate the validity of our main result, we provide a concrete example along with a MATLAB-based visualization of the convergence behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our main result by finding a solution for a fractional differential equation under some suitable assumptions.

A Type 2 Fuzzy Set Approach for Building Linear Linguistic Regression Analysis under Multi Uncertainty
Junzo Watada, Pei-Chun Lin, Bo Wang, Jeng-Shyang Pan, Jose Guadalupe Flores Muniz
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm for constructing a Type-2 Fuzzy Set of the Linear Linguistic Regression (T2F-LLR) model, designed to address uncertainty and vagueness in real-world decision-making. We consider a practical scenario involving a cosmetic company's promotional planning across four product categories: Basic Face Care, Face Cleaning, Cosmetics, and Body Care, aimed at both male and female consumers. Data are collected using fuzzy linguistic questionnaires from customers and expert managers, with responses expressed using qualitative terms such as 'always', 'frequently', 'Often', 'Sometimes', and 'frequently'. These linguistic evaluations are modeled as Type-2 Fuzzy Set of Linear Linguistic regression (T2F-LLR) variables to capture both randomness and higher-order fuzziness. We rigorously develop a solution framework based on a one-sigma confidence interval using the credibility measure to calculate the expected values and variances of the model output. To improve computational efficiency and usability of decisions, we introduce a heuristic algorithm tailored for non-meta datasets, significantly reducing the complexity of the model solving process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of weight equals 7.97\% with all variables statistically significant. We also provide the significant results for each product using the one-way analysis of variance test (one-way ANOVA test) ($p$-value = 0.15) and the paired $t$ test ($p$-value = 0.16). The results show that there is no significant difference between observed and predicted weights overall. This paper provides a robust and interpretable methodology for decision makers dealing with imprecise data and time-sensitive planning.

The Structure of Extremal Bad Science Matrices
Shridhar Sinha
Comments:
27 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Probability (math.PR)
We study the 'bad science matrix problem': among all matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ whose rows have unit $\ell_2$-norm, determine the maximum of $\beta(A)=\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x\in\{\pm1\}^n}\|Ax\|_\infty$. Steinerberger [1] (arXiv:2402.03205) showed that the optimal asymptotic rate is $(1+o(1))\sqrt{2\log n}$, and that this rate is attained with high probability by matrices with i.i.d. $\pm1$ entries after normalization. More recent explicit constructions [2] (arXiv:2408.00933) achieve $\beta(A)\ge\sqrt{\log_2(n)+1}$, which lies within a constant factor of the asymptotic optimum. In this paper we bridge the gap between the probabilistic and explicit approaches. We give a geometric description of extremizers as (nearly) isoperimetrically extremal partitions of the $n$-dimensional hypercube induced by the rows of $A$. We obtain precise rates for heuristic constructions by recasting the maximization of $\beta(A)$ in the language of high-dimensional central-limit theorems as in Fang, Koike, Liu and Zhao [16] (arXiv:2305.17365). Using these connections, we present a family of explicit deterministic matrices $A_n$ that exist for all $n$ under the assumption of Hadamard's conjecture, and for infinitely many $n$ unconditionally, such that for all $n$ sufficiently large $\beta(A_n)\ge\bigl(1 - \frac{\log\log(2n)}{4\log(2n)}\bigr)\sqrt{2\log(2n)}.$

MAGNET-KG: Maximum-Entropy Geometric Networks for Temporal Knowledge Graphs: Theoretical Foundations and Mathematical Framework

Subjects:

We present a unified theoretical framework for temporal knowledge graphs grounded in maximum-entropy principles, differential geometry, and information theory. We prove a unique characterization of scoring functions via the maximum-entropy principle and establish necessity theorems for specific geometric choices. We further provide rigorous derivations of generalization bounds with explicit constants and outline conditions under which consistency guarantees hold under temporal dependence. The framework establishes principled foundations for temporal knowledge graph modeling with formal connections to differential geometric methods.

Title:
A Dynamical Criterion Equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis
Hendrik Wladimir Albrecht Edwin Kuipers
Comments:
Comments: 25 pages; includes appendices with explicit constants and numerical audit
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We introduce a discrete dynamical system on the integers, defined by moving a composite $m$ forward to $m+\pi(m)$ and a prime $p$ backward to $p-\mathrm{prevprime}(p)$. This map produces trajectories whose contraction properties are closely tied to the distribution of primes.
We prove unconditional contraction inequalities for error terms derived from these trajectories, using explicit remainder bounds from the smoothed explicit formula. Building on this, we show that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to a sharp contraction condition: the trajectory error functional satisfies $E(X)\ll X^{1/2}\log X$. The forward implication follows directly from von Koch's classical bound under RH. For the converse, we invoke the Landau--Littlewood $\Omega$-results, which guarantee that any off-critical zero forces oscillations large enough to violate the contraction inequality.
This establishes a new dynamical reformulation of RH: the critical-line conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that integer trajectories remain uniformly contracted at the scale $X^{1/2}\log X$, equivalently, RH holds. The perspective is distinct from earlier analytic equivalents, as it arises from stability properties of a simple deterministic system rather than from Hilbert space or Dirichlet polynomial approximations.

The Modular Energy Function: Exact Identities and a Primality Equivalence
Es-said En-naoui
Comments:
11 pages
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We introduce and study the arithmetic function E_m(n), defined as the sum of the remainders of n when divided by the first m positive integers. Although the definition is elementary, the function encodes rich arithmetic structure. In this first part we develop exact algebraic and combinatorial identities, including floor-sum and divisor-sum reformulations, quotient-residue decompositions, sharp bounds and extremal classes, and symmetry relations. We also establish a diagonal identity linking E_n(n) to the classical sum of divisors function, which leads to an exact equivalence characterizing primality in terms of differences of modular energy values. Additional results include congruence decompositions, recursion formulas, and structural properties when n<m, n>m, or when n or m is prime. These identities form the foundation for a second part, where analytic and asymptotic properties will be investigated.

Comments:

We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite $G$-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with $G$-symmetry correspond to $\mathbf{2SVect}$-enriched $G$-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with $G$-symmetry saturating an anomaly. More generally, we also explain how 2-categorical (de-) equivariantization yields a classification of all braided fusion 2-categories.

Instanton properties of the characteristic connection $\nabla$ on an integrable $G_2$ manifold as well as instanton condition of the torsion connection $\nabla$ on a $Spin(7)$ manifold are investigated. It is shown that for an integrable $G_2$ manifold with $\nabla$-parallel Lee form the curvature of the characteristic connection is a $G_2$ instanton exactly when the torsion 3-form is $\nabla$-parallel. It is observed that on a compact $Spin(7)$ manifold with $\nabla$ closed torsion 3-form the torsion connection is a $Spin(7)$ instanton if and only if the torsion 3-form is parallel with respect to the torsion connection.

Heavy repulsion of clusters in Bernoulli percolation
Sasha Bell, Tasmin Chu, Owen Rodgers, Grigory Terlov, Anush Tserunyan
Comments:
19 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study Bernoulli$(p)$ percolation on (non)unimodular quasi-transitive graphs and prove that, almost surely, for any two heavy clusters $C$ and $C'$, the set of vertices in $C$ within distance one of $C'$ is light, i.e. it has finite total weight. This is a significant step towards resolving a longstanding question posed by Häggström, Peres, and Schonmann, and a generalization of a theorem of Timár, who proved the same result in the unimodular setting. Our proof adapts Timár's approach but requires developing weighted analogues of several classical unimodular results. This presents nontrivial challenges, since in a nonunimodular graph a subtree with infinitely many ends may be hyperfinite or even light. To overcome this, we employ newly developed machinery from the theory of measure-class-preserving equivalence relations and graphs. In particular, we establish a weighted generalization of a theorem of Benjamini, Lyons, and Schramm on the existence of an invariant random subgraph with positive weighted Cheeger constant, a result of independent interest.

We compute the complexity of this algorithm when $X$ is defined over a finite field, and provide a complete implementation in SageMath, as well as some explicit examples. We then apply this algorithm to the computation of the cohomology complex of a locally constant sheaf of $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$-modules on such a curve.

The results show how the original eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors are involved in composing such perturbed invariant subspaces and eigenvectors.

Maximum augmented Zagreb index on polyomino chains
Manuel Montes-y-Morales, Saylé Sigarreta, Hugo Cruz-Suárez
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we present a dynamic programming approach for identifying extremal polyomino chains with respect to degree-based topological indices. This approach provides an explicit recurrence and constructive algorithm that enables both the computation of an extremal polyomino chain in linear time with respect to its number of squares, and the enumeration of all maximal configurations in linear time with respect to their amount. As a main application, we resolve a problem posed in 2016 by characterizing the polyomino chains that maximize the Augmented Zagreb Index ($AZI$) for any fixed number of squares. The $AZI$, a degree-based index known for its strong chemical applicability in numerous studies, attains its maximum on two specific families of polyomino chains depending on the parity of their number of squares. We also derive closed-form expressions for the maximum $AZI$ and determine the exact number of extremal configurations. The results presented in this paper are aligned with previous contributions, and establish a constructive methodology for solving extremal problems in chemical graph theory, for which we provide a link to the code in the last section.

A generalised Ramsey--Turán problem for matchings
Peter Keevash, Peleg Michaeli
Comments:
25 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We prove a generalised Ramsey--Turán theorem for matchings, which (a) simultaneously generalises the Cockayne--Lorimer Theorem (Ramsey for matchings) and the Erdős--Gallai Theorem (Turán for matchings), and (b) is a generalised Turán theorem in the sense that we can optimise the count of any clique (Turán-type theorems optimise the count of edges). More precisely, for integers $q \ge 1$, $n \ge \ell \ge 2$, and $t_1,\dots,t_q \ge 1$ we determine the maximum number of $\ell$-vertex complete subgraphs in an $n$-vertex graph that admits a $q$-edge-colouring in which, for each $j=1,\dots,q$, the $j$-coloured subgraph has no matching of size $t_j$. We achieve this by identifying two explicit constructions and applying a compression argument to show that one of them achieves the maximum. Our compression algorithm is quite intricate and introduces methods that have not previously been applied to these types of problems: it employs an optimisation problem defined by the Gallai--Edmonds decompositions of each colour.

Amenability, Optimal Transport and Abstract Ergodic Theorems
Christian Rosendal
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Group Theory (math.GR); Logic (math.LO)
Using tools from the theory of optimal transport, we establish several results concerning isometric actions of amenable topological groups with potentially unbounded orbits. Specifically, suppose $d$ is a compatible left-invariant metric on an amenable topological group $G$ with no non-trivial homomorphisms to $\mathbb R$. Then, for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and $\epsilon>0$, there is a finitely supported probability measure $\beta$ on $G$ such that $$ \max_{g,h\in E}\, {\sf W}(\beta g, \beta h)<\epsilon, $$ where ${\sf W}$ denotes the Wasserstein distance between probability measures on the metric space $(G,d)$. When $d$ is the word metric on a finitely generated group $G$, this strengthens a well known theorem of Reiter and, when $d$ is bounded, recovers a result of Schneider and Thom. Furthermore, when $G$ is locally compact, $\beta$ may be replaced by an appropriate probability density $f\in L^1(G)$.
Also, when $G\curvearrowright X$ is a continuous isometric action on a metric space, the space of Lipschitz functions on the quotient $X/\!\!/G$ is isometrically isomorphic to a $1$-complemented subspace of the Lipschitz functions on $X$. And, when additionally $G$ is skew-amenable, there is a $G$-invariant contraction $$ \mathfrak {Lip}\, X \overset S\longrightarrow\mathfrak{Lip}(X/\!\!/G) $$ so that $(S\phi\big)\big(\overline{Gx}\big)=\phi(x)$ whenever $\phi$ is constant on every orbit of $G\curvearrowright X$. This latter extends results of Cuth and Doucha from the setting of locally compact or balanced groups.

We apply the approach developed in our previous papers to obtain examples of solutions to the inverse spectral problem (ISP) for the canonical Hamiltonian system. One of our goals is to illustrate connections of ISP with classical tools of analysis, such as the Hilbert transform and solutions to the Riemann-Hilbert problem. A key role in our study is played by the systems with homogeneous and quasi-homogeneous spectral measures. We show how some of such systems give rise to families of Bessel functions.

Demand Charge Management: Prototype Design and Testing

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of a smart, low-cost Energy Management System (EMS) and Demand Charge Management (DCM) prototype, developed as part of an undergraduate senior design project. The system serves as both a practical solution for reducing electricity costs and a pedagogical tool for teaching real-time energy control concepts in power and embedded systems courses. Unlike conventional EMS/DCM solutions that rely on high-cost commercial hardware or purely theoretical models, the proposed system integrates grid power, lithium-iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery storage, and real-time control into a unified, scalable platform constructed at a fraction of the cost, approximately $1,800 compared to over $16,000 for leading commercial options. The controller dynamically optimizes energy usage by switching between grid and battery sources based on real-time measurements of electricity prices, load power, and battery state of charge (SoC). This enables peak shaving, energy arbitrage, and backup power functionality, thereby enhancing cost efficiency and grid resilience for both residential and small commercial users. The architecture features a modular three-layer design comprising a sensing layer for electrical data acquisition, a control layer executing Python-based logic on a Raspberry Pi, and an actuator layer for seamless energy switching. Data is communicated via MQTT and visualized through the Blynk IoT platform, providing an intuitive and remotely accessible user interface. The prototype's effectiveness was validated through real-world testing, confirming its capability to reduce demand charges and ensure reliable energy delivery under varying operational conditions. Its affordability, open-source control logic, and educational versatility make it an ideal candidate for both deployment and instructional use.

We consider an inverse problem governed by the Westervelt equation with linear diffusivity and quadratic-type nonlinearity. The objective of this problem is to recover all the coefficients of this nonlinear partial differential equation. We show that, by constructing complex-valued time-periodic solutions excited from the boundary time-harmonically at a sufficiently high frequency, knowledge of the first- and second-harmonic Cauchy data at the boundary is sufficient to simultaneously determine the wave speed, diffusivity and nonlinearity in the interior of the domain of interest.

Large-Scale Network Utility Maximization via GPU-Accelerated Proximal Message Passing

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We present a GPU-accelerated proximal message passing algorithm for large-scale network utility maximization (NUM). NUM is a fundamental problem in resource allocation, where resources are allocated across various streams in a network to maximize total utility while respecting link capacity constraints. Our method, a variant of ADMM, requires only sparse matrix-vector multiplies with the link-route matrix and element-wise proximal operator evaluations, enabling fully parallel updates across streams and links. It also supports heterogeneous utility types, including logarithmic utilities common in NUM, and does not assume strict concavity. We implement our method in PyTorch and demonstrate its performance on problems with tens of millions of variables and constraints, achieving 4x to 20x speedups over existing CPU and GPU solvers and solving problem sizes that exhaust the memory of baseline methods. Additionally, we show that our algorithm is robust to congestion and link-capacity degradation. Finally, using a time-expanded transit seat allocation case study, we illustrate how our approach yields interpretable allocations in realistic networks.

Let $X$ be a Mori dream K3 surface of Picard rank $2$. We compute the nef cone of the Hilbert scheme $X^{[n]}$ of $n$ points on $X$ for large $n$ using Bridgeland stability methods. We also find bounds on the nef cone for small $n$. Studying the geometry of a $2$-to-$1$ cover $X\rightarrow Q$ of a smooth quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$, and its induced rational map $X^{[2]}\dashrightarrow Q^{[2]}$ on the Hilbert schemes, we calculate the nef cone of $X^{[2]}$ in a particular case. Finally, we also find the nef cone of the nested Hilbert scheme $X^{[n,n+1]}$ for large $n$.

Conditional existence of maximizers for the Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The Tomas-Stein inequality for a compact subset $\Gamma$ of the sphere $S^d$ states that the mapping $f\mapsto \widehat{f\sigma}$ is bounded from $L^2(\Gamma,\sigma)$ to $L^{2+4/d}(\R^{d+1})$. Then conditional on a strict comparison between the best constants for the sphere and for the Strichartz inequality for the Schrödinger equations, we prove that there exist functions which extremize this inequality, and any extremising sequence has a subsequence which converges to an extremizer. The method is based on the refined Tomas-Stein inequality for the sphere and the profile decompositions. The key ingredient to establish orthogonality in profile decompositions is that we use Tao's sharp bilinear restriction theorem for the paraboloids beyond the Tomas-Stein range. Similar results have been previously established by Frank, Lieb and Sabin \cite{Frank-Lieb-Sabin:2007:maxi-sphere-2d}, where they used the method of the missing mass.

We propose a geometric approach to studying the spectral properties of squared distance matrices of infinite size, constructed from a countable set of points $\{\xi_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}$ on Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We move from the discrete problem to a continuous one using walk matrices. We describe the structure of the spectrum and study the properties of spectral flows.

Uniquely-Decodable Coding for Zero-Error Network Function Computation

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We consider uniquely-decodable coding for zero-error network function computation, where in a directed acyclic graph, the single sink node is required to compute with zero error a target function multiple times, whose arguments are the information sources generated at a set of source nodes. We are interested in the computing capacity from the information theoretic point of view, which is defined as the infimum of the maximum expected number of bits transmitted on all the edges for computing the target function once on average. We first prove some new results on clique entropy, in particular, the substitution lemma of clique entropy for probabilistic graphs with a certain condition. With them, we prove a lower bound on the computing capacity associated with clique entropies of the induced characteristic graphs, where the obtained lower bound is applicable to arbitrary network topologies, arbitrary information sources, and arbitrary target functions. By refining the probability distribution of information sources, we further strictly improve the obtained lower bound. In addition, we compare uniquely-decodable network function-computing coding and fixed-length network function-computing coding, and show that the former indeed outperforms the latter in terms of the computing capacity. Therein, we provide a novel graph-theoretic explanation of the key parameter in the best known bound on the computing capacity for fixed-length network function-computing codes, which would be helpful to improve the existing results.

Specifically, if this degree does not coincide with any growth of polynomial-growth harmonic functions on the cone, then the corresponding dimensions are equal.

A determinant-line and degree obstruction to foliation transversality
Mostafa Khosravi Farsani
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Let pi: M^{ell+n} -> B^n be a submersion that presents a regular foliation by its fibers, and let S^n subset M be a closed embedded complementary submanifold, with f = pi|S: S -> B. We give two concise obstructions to keeping S everywhere transverse. (A) Determinant-line obstruction: with L = det(TS)^* tensor f^* det(TB) -> S, a C^1-small perturbation makes the tangency locus Z = {det(df) = 0} subset S a closed (n-1)-dimensional submanifold whose mod 2 fundamental class equals PD(w1(L)) in H{n-1}(S; Z_2). In particular, when n = 1 the set of tangencies is finite and the parity of #Z equals the pairing <w1(L), [S]> mod 2. (B) Twisted homology/degree obstruction: if pi is proper with connected fibers and f_[S]_{f^ O_B} = 0 in H_n(B; O_B) (top homology with the orientation local system), then S must be tangent somewhere. These recover the covering-space argument in the orientable case and extend to nonorientable settings via w1(L). We also give short applications beyond the classical degree test, including the case H_n(B; O_B) = 0 and a nonorientable base with vanishing top homology.

In this short note, we develop trigonometric selector kernels to represent odd zeta values via dual hyperbolic counterparts. This framework highlights a Fourier-Poisson duality, incorporating finite-part integrals in the sense of Hadamard-Galapon. In particular, we show how such kernels naturally recover Euler-Maclaurin and Poisson summation formulas as dual manifestations. We further connect our kernel approach with the finite-part integral formulation, extending earlier Cvijović-Klinowski type representations for odd zeta values.

Navier-Stokes Equations with Fractional Dissipation and Associated Doubly Stochastic Yule Cascades

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Parametric regions are identified in terms of the spatial dimension $d$ and the power $\gamma$ of the Laplacian that separate explosive from non-explosive regimes for the self-similar doubly stochastic Yule cascades (DSY) naturally associated with the deterministic fractional Navier-Stokes equations (FNSE) on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the scaling-supercritical setting. Explosion and/or geometric properties of the DSY, are then used to establish non-uniqueness, local existence, and finite-time blow-up results for a scalar partial differential equation associated to the FNSE through a majorization principle at the level of stochastic solution processes. The solution processes themselves are constructed from the DSY and yield solutions to the FNSE upon taking expectations.
In the special case $d=2$, a closed-form expression for the solution process of the FNSE is derived. This representation is employed to prove finite-time loss of integrability of the solution process for sufficiently large initial data. Notably, this lack of integrability does not necessarily imply blow-up of the FNSE solutions themselves. In fact, in the radially symmetric case, solutions can be continued beyond the integrability threshold by employing a modified notion of averaging.

We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the Čech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively Høegh-Krohn-Skjelbred.

Efficient High-Dimensional Conditional Independence Testing
Bilol Banerjee
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
This article deals with the problem of testing conditional independence between two random vectors ${\bf X}$ and ${\bf Y}$ given a confounding random vector ${\bf Z}$. Several authors have considered this problem for multivariate data. However, most of the existing tests has poor performance against local contiguous alternatives beyond linear dependency. In this article, an Energy distance type measure of conditional dependence is developed, borrowing ideas from the model-X framework. A consistent estimator of the measure is proposed, and its theoretical properties are studied under general assumptions. Using the estimator as a test statistic a test of conditional independence is developed, and a suitable resampling algorithm is designed to calibrate the test. The test turns out to be not only large sample consistent, but also Pitman efficient against local contiguous alternatives, and is provably consistent when the dimension of the data diverges to infinity with the sample size. Several empirical studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the test against state-of-the-art methods.

Highly Efficient Optimal Control for Lyophilization via Simulation of Discrete/Continuous Mixed-index Differential-algebraic Equations
Prakitr Srisuma, Richard D. Braatz
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This article presents a highly efficient optimal control algorithm and policies for lyophilization (also known as freeze drying). The optimal solutions and control policies are derived using an extended version of the simulation-based algorithm, which reformulates the optimal control problem as a hybrid discrete/continuous system of mixed-index differential-algebraic equations and subsequently calculates the optimal control vector via simulation of the resulting DAEs. Our algorithm and control policies are demonstrated via a number of case studies that encompass various lyophilization and optimal control strategies. All the case studies can be solved within less than a second on a normal laptop, regardless of their complexity. The method is several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional optimization-based techniques while giving similar/better accuracy. The proposed algorithm offers an efficient and reliable framework for optimal control of lyophilization, which can also be extended to other similar systems with phase transitions.

The coupling of mixed and primal finite element methods for the coupled body-plate problem
Jun Hu, Zhen Liu, Rui Ma
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper considers the coupled problem of a three-dimensional elastic body and a two-dimensional plate, which are rigidly connected at their interface. The plate consists of a plane elasticity model along the longitudinal direction and a plate bending model with Kirchhoff assumptions along the transverse direction. The Hellinger-Reissner formulation is adopted for the body by introducing the stress as an auxiliary variable, while the primal formulation is employed for the plate. The well-posedness of the weak formulation is established. This approach enables direct stress approximations and allows for non-matching meshes at the interface since the continuity condition of displacements acts as a natural boundary condition for the body. Under certain assumptions, discrete stability and error estimates are derived for both conforming and nonconforming finite element methods. Two specific pairs of conforming and nonconforming finite elements are shown to satisfy the required assumptions, respectively. Furthermore, the problem is reduced to an interface problem based on the domain decomposition, which can be solved effectively by a conjugate gradient iteration. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results.

Purity and distances between conjugates of elements over henselian valued fields
Arpan Dutta, Josnei Novacoski
Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
For a henselian valued field $(K,v)$ and a separable-algebraic element $a\in\overline{K}\setminus K$, we consider the set $S_K(a):= \{ v(a-a^\prime) \mid a^\prime\neq a \text{ is a $K$-conjugate of $a$} \}$. The central aim of this paper is to provide a bound for the cardinality of the set $S_K(a)$, and to characterize the elements $a$ for which this set is a singleton. Connections of this set with the notion of \textit{depth} of $a$ has also been explored. We show that $S_K(a)$ is a singleton whenever $K(a)|K$ is a minimal extension. A stronger version of this result is obtained when $a$ has depth one over $K$. We also provide a host of examples illustrating that the bounds obtained are strict.
Apart from being of independent interest, another primary motivation for considering this problem comes from the study of ramification ideals. In the depth one case, when $K(a)|K$ is a Galois extension, we obtain intimate connections between the cardinalities of $S_K(a)$ and the number of ramification ideals of the extension $(K(a)|K,v)$. In particular, we show that these cardinalities are same whenever the extension is defectless and non-tame, or whenever $(K,v)$ has rank one. In order to obtain these results, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the ramification ideals of $(K(a)|K,v)$ which extend the known results in this direction.

On the Squared Distance Matrix of a Starlike Block Graph

Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of a simple connected graph $G$. The Hadamard product $D(G)~\circ~ D(G)$ is called the squared distance matrix of $G$, and is denoted by $\Delta(G)$. A simple connected graph is called a starlike block graph if it has a central cut vertex, and each of its blocks is a complete graph. Let $ \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b)$ be the starlike block graph with blocks $K_{n_1+1}, K_{n_2+1}, \ldots, K_{n_b+1} $ on $n=1 + \sum_{i=1}^b n_i$ vertices. In this article, we compute the determinant of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$ and find its inverse as a rank-one perturbation of a positive semidefinite Laplacian-like matrix $\mathcal{L}$ with rank $n-1$. We also investigate the inertia of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$. Furthermore, for a fixed value of $ n $ and $ b $, we determine the extremal graphs that uniquely attain the maximum and minimum spectral radius of the squared distance matrix for starlike block graphs on $ n $ vertices and $ b $ blocks.

For each $(x, y) \in[0,1]^2$, we define the asymptotic approximation exponent $$ v_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=\sup \left\{0 \leq v<\infty: \begin{array}{l} T_{\beta_1}^n x<\beta_1^{-n v} \\ T_{\beta_2}^n y<\beta_2^{-n v} \end{array} \text { for infinitely many } n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \text {, } $$ and the uniform approximation exponent $$ \hat{v}_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=\sup \left\{0 \leq \hat{v}<\infty: \forall~ N \gg 1, \exists 1 \leq n \leq N \text { such that } \begin{array}{l} T_{\beta_1}^n x < \beta_1^{-N \hat{v}} \\ T_{\beta_2}^n y < \beta_2^{-N \hat{v}} \end{array}\right\} . $$ We calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection $$\left\{(x, y) \in[0,1]^2: \hat{v}_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=\hat{v} \text { and } v_{\beta_1, \beta_2}(x, y)=v\right\}$$ for any $\hat{v}$ and $v$ satisfying $\log _{\beta_2}{\beta_1}>\frac{\hat{v}}{v}(1+v)$. As a corollary, we establish a definite formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the level set of the uniform approximation exponent.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study a Skellam point process on $\mathbb{R}^M_+$, $M\ge1$. For $M=2$, it reduces to a Skellam random field on plane which is a two parameter Lévy process with rectangular increment. A weak convergent result is obtained for it. Further, we consider three fractional variants of Skellam random field on positive quadrant of plane. Their point probabilities, associated governing equations, and other distributional properties are studied in detail. Later, we consider an integral of Skellam random field over rectangle and derive a scaled compound Poisson field characterization for it.

A Broadcast Channel Framework for MIMO-OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communication

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to be one of the major features of 6G wireless networks. In an ISAC system, communications and sensing functionalities are jointly performed using the same waveform, frequency band and hardware, thereby enabling various use cases such as in cyber physical systems, digital twin and smart cities. A major challenge to the design and analysis of ISAC is a unified framework that incorporates the two distinct functions. By viewing ISAC as a type of broadcast channel, in this paper, we propose a unified ISAC framework in which communication and sensing signals are broadcast to the actual communication users and virtual sensing users. This framework allows the application of existing multiplexing schemes, such as dirty paper coding (DPC) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) that have been intensively studied in data communications and information theory. Within this framework, we propose different superposition coding schemes, for cases when the sensing waveform is known or unknown to the communication receiver. We propose the waveform optimization algorithms in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setting accounting for the effects of clutter and Doppler shift. The proposed framework is numerically evaluated for different schemes under various sensing and communications performance metrics.

Alexandrov estimates for polynomial operators by determinant majorization
F. Reese Harvey, Kevin R. Payne
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We obtain estimates on the supremum, infimum and oscillation of solutions for a wide class of inhomogeneous fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Euclidean domains where the differential operator is an I-central Garding-Dirichlet operator in the sense of Harvey-Lawson (2024). The argument combines two recent results: an Alexandrov estimate of Payne-Redaelli (2025) for locally semiconvex functions based on the area formula and a determinant majorization estimate of Harvey-Lawson (2024).
The determinant majorization estimate has as a special case the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality, so the result includes the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for linear operators. A potential theoretic approach is used involving subequation subharmonics and their dual subharmonics. Semiconvex approximation plays a crucial role.

We study the local Langlands functoriality transfer from $\text{SO}(5, F)$ to $\text{GL}(4, F)$ for arbitrary twists of several families of irreducible supercuspidal representations of $\text{GL}(4, F)$, where $F$ is a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. In doing so, we give equivalent conditions for such representations to be functoriality transfers from $\text{SO}(5, F)$ in terms of the Bushnell-Kutzko construction of supercuspidal representations by studying poles of local exterior square $L$-functions and the existence of non-zero local Shalika models. This article provides a starting point for an explicit characterization of this functoriality transfer in terms of type theory.

A classification of equivariant fibrations with the property of uniqueness of a covering path is given.

Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators

Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.

Short history of signed exceptional sequences

Comments:

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Whereas exceptional sequences have a long history with many well-known connections to combinatorics, signed exceptional sequences are relatively recent. The authors introduced this concept in 2017 [19], although it was retroactively realized that the category of noncrossing partitions [24] is a special case of this construction. Buan and Marsh [4] have introduced the concept of $\tau$-exceptional sequences to generalize the definitions and theorems to all finite dimensional algebras. This short paper is the story of the original concept of signed exceptional sequences for hereditary algebras and how it developed out of the two authors' study of algebraic K-theory, link invariants, and cluster combinatorics.

We give a cabling formula for the Links--Gould polynomial of knots colored with a $4n$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathrm{U}^H_q\mathfrak{sl}(2|1)$ and identify them with the $V_n$-polynomial of knots for $n=2$. Using the cabling formula, we obtain genus bounds and a specialization to the Alexander polynomial for the colored Links--Gould polynomial that is independent of $n$, which implies corresponding properties of the $V_n$-polynomial for $n=2$ conjectured in previous work of two of the authors, and extends the work done for $n=1$. Combined with work of one of the authors arXiv:2409.03557, our genus bound for $\mathrm{LG}^{(2)}=V_2$ is sharp for all knots with up to $16$ crossings.

Detectability Thresholds for Network Attacks on Static Graphs and Temporal Networks: Information-Theoretic Limits and Nearly-Optimal Tests
Abdulkader Hajjouz, Elena Avksentieva
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We develop a consolidated theory for the detectability of network-borne attacks under two canonical observation models: (i) a static graph drawn from an Erdos-Renyi background with a planted anomalous community, and (ii) a temporal interaction network modeled by multivariate point processes (Poisson or Hawkes). Our main contribution is to match, up to universal constants, information-theoretic lower and upper bounds that govern when reliable testing is possible. In the static case, the core quantity is the accumulated edgewise signal k^2 * chi^2(Bern(p+Delta) || Bern(p)), where chi^2 ~ Delta^2 / [p(1-p)] for small Delta; detection is impossible when this falls below c * log n, and a non-backtracking spectral statistic succeeds above C * log n. In the temporal case, detectability is controlled by the KL information rate I contributed by internal edges over a window of length T, yielding a threshold T I >= log n; a likelihood-based cumulative-sum (CUSUM) test achieves first-order optimal delay approximately abs(log alpha) / I at false-alarm level alpha. We also quantify robustness to bounded edge perturbations and outline conditional statistical-computational separations. A brief case study shows how to turn these bounds into concrete design choices.

Quantitative analysis of using posits versus binary64 in log-space in the context of statistical bioinformatics. Published at 2025 IEEE IISWC (this https URL)
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Hardware Architecture (cs.AR)
Statistical computations are becoming increasingly important. These computations often need to be performed in log-space because probabilities become extremely small due to repeated multiplications. While using logarithms effectively prevents numerical underflow, this paper shows that its cost is high in performance, resource utilization, and, notably, numerical accuracy. This paper then argues that using posit, a recently proposed floating-point format, is a better strategy for statistical computations operating on extremely small numbers because of its unique encoding mechanism. To that end, this paper performs a comprehensive analysis comparing posit, binary64, and logarithm representations, examining both individual arithmetic operations, statistical bioinformatics applications, and their accelerators. FPGA implementation results highlight that posit-based accelerators can achieve up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy, up to 60\% lower resource utilization, and up to $1.3\times$ speedup, compared to log-space accelerators. Such improvement translates to $2\times$ performance per unit resource on the FPGA.

We propose and study blowup relations obeyed by the partition functions of $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ (quiver) SYM theories with $SU(2)$ gauge group and four flavours. By analyzing the Weyl group action on the sets of blowup relations, we identify the integer parameters of a blowup relation with the weights of a corresponding Lie algebra. We also explain how this action of the Weyl group follows from the Weyl group symmetry of the partition function. Finally, we use these relations to derive bilinear relations on the $q$-Painlevé VI tau functions.

In 2019, Sivaraman conjectured that every $P_k$-free graph has cop number at most $k-3$. In the same year, Liu proved this conjecture for $(P_k,\text{claw})$-free graphs. Recently Chudnovsky, Norin, Seymour, and Turcotte proved this conjecture for $P_5$-free graphs. For $k\geq 6$ the conjecture remains widely opened. Let the $E$ graph be the $\text{claw}$ with two subdivided edges. We show that all $(P_k,E)$-free graphs have cop number at most $\lceil \frac{k-1}{2} \rceil +3$, which improves and generalizes Liu's result for $(P_k,\text{claw})$-free graphs. We also prove that if $G$ is a graph whose longest path is length $p$, then $G$ has cop number at most $\lceil \frac{2p}{3} \rceil+3$. This improves a bound of Joret, Kamiński, and Theis. Our proof relies on demonstrating that all $(P_k,\text{claw},\text{butterfly},C_4,C_5)$-free graphs have cop number at most $\lceil\frac{k-1}{3}\rceil +3$.

Minimizing measures for the doubling condition

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
We study those measures whose doubling constant is the least possible among doubling measures on a given metric space. It is shown that such measures exist on every metric space supporting at least one doubling measure. In addition, a connection between minimizers for the doubling constant and superharmonic functions is exhibited. This allows us to show that for the particular case of the euclidean space $\mathbb R^d$, Lebesgue measure is the only minimizer for the doubling constant (up to constant multiples) precisely when $d=1$ or $d=2$, while for $d\geq3$ there are infinitely many independent minimizers. Analogously, in the discrete setting, we can show uniqueness of the counting measure as a minimizer for regular graphs where the standard random walk is a recurrent Markov chain. The counting measure is also shown to be a minimizer in every infinite graph where the cardinality of balls depends solely on their radii.

Development and Analysis of Chien-Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Singular Perturbation Problems
Gautam Singh, Sofia Haider
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this article, we employ Chien-Physics Informed Neural Networks (C-PINNs) to obtain solutions for singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and their coupled forms in both one and two-dimensional settings. While PINNs have emerged as a powerful tool for solving various types of differential equations, their application to singular perturbation problems (SPPs) presents significant challenges. These challenges arise because a small perturbation parameter multiplies the highest-order derivatives, leading to sharp gradient changes near the boundary layer. To overcome these difficulties, we apply C-PINNs, a modified version of the standard PINNs framework, which is specifically designed to address singular perturbation problems. Our study shows that C-PINNs provide a more accurate solution for SPPs, demonstrating better performance than conventional methods.

The completeness properties of spaces of immersed curves equipped with reparametrization-invariant Riemannian metrics have recently been the subject of active research. This thesis studies the metric completion of spaces of immersed open curves endowed with Sobolev-type metrics and examines a previously proposed conjecture that suggests the metric completion consists of a single additional point, representing all vanishing length Cauchy sequences. We disprove the conjecture in the setting of real-valued immersed curves by demonstrating the existence of multiple distinct limit points. Furthermore, we provide a nearly complete characterization of the metric structure of the metric completion in this case. These results lead to a revised conjecture regarding the structure of the metric completion in more general settings

Testing for LLM response differences: the case of a composite null consisting of semantically irrelevant query perturbations
Aranyak Acharyya, Carey E. Priebe, Hayden S. Helm
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Methodology (stat.ME)
Given an input query, generative models such as large language models produce a random response drawn from a response distribution. Given two input queries, it is natural to ask if their response distributions are the same. While traditional statistical hypothesis testing is designed to address this question, the response distribution induced by an input query is often sensitive to semantically irrelevant perturbations to the query, so much so that a traditional test of equality might indicate that two semantically equivalent queries induce statistically different response distributions. As a result, the outcome of the statistical test may not align with the user's requirements. In this paper, we address this misalignment by incorporating into the testing procedure consideration of a collection of semantically similar queries. In our setting, the mapping from the collection of user-defined semantically similar queries to the corresponding collection of response distributions is not known a priori and must be estimated, with a fixed budget. Although the problem we address is quite general, we focus our analysis on the setting where the responses are binary, show that the proposed test is asymptotically valid and consistent, and discuss important practical considerations with respect to power and computation.

The proof relies on an extension of the duality relation of the super-Brownian motion, which allows us to treat a broad class of admissible drifts, including functions that are non-Lipschitz or discontinuous at zero.

We extend the monotonicity method for direct exact reconstruction of inclusions in the partial data Calderón problem, to the case of anisotropic conductivities in any spatial dimension $d\geq 2$. Specifically, from a local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map, we give reconstruction methods of inclusions based on unknown anisotropic self-adjoint perturbations to a known anisotropic conductivity coefficient. A main assumption is a definiteness condition for the perturbations near the outer inclusion boundaries. This additionally provides new insights into the non-uniqueness issues of the anisotropic Calderón problem.

The aim of this paper is to provide purely arithmetical characterisations of those natural numbers $n$ for which every non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of cardinality $n$ of the Yang--Baxter equation arising from a skew brace (sb-solution for short) satisfies some relevant properties, such as being a flip or being involutive. For example, it turns out that every sb-solution of cardinality $n$ has finite multipermutation level if and only if its prime factorisation $n= p_1^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_t^{\alpha_t}$ is cube-free, namely $\alpha_i\leq 2$ for every $i$, and $p_i$ does not divide $p_j^{\alpha_j}-1$ for $i\neq j$. Two novel constructions of skew braces will play a central role in our proofs.
We shall also introduce the notion of supersoluble solution and show how this concept is related to that of supersoluble skew brace. In doing so, we have spotted an irreparable mistake in the proof of Theorem C [Ballester-Bolinches et al., Adv. Math. 455 (2024)], which characterizes soluble solutions in terms of soluble skew braces.

Metric Subregularity of Multifunctions and Applications to Characterizations of Asplund Spaces
Zhou Wei, Michel Thera, Jen-Chih Yao
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we investigate metric subregularity of multifunctions between Asplund spaces. Using Mordukhovich normal cones and coderivatives, we introduce the limiting Basic Constraint Qualification (BCQ) associated with a given multifunction. This BCQ provides necessary dual conditions for the metric subregularity of multifunctions in the Asplund space setting.
Furthermore, we establish characterizations of Asplund spaces in terms of the limiting BCQ condition implied by metric subregularity. By employing Frechet normal cones and coderivatives, we derive necessary dual conditions for metric subregularity expressed as fuzzy inclusions, and we also obtain characterizations of Asplund spaces via these fuzzy inclusions.
As an application, we examine metric subregularity of the conic inequality defined by a vector-valued function and a closed (not necessarily convex) cone with a nontrivial recession cone. By using Mordukhovich and Frechet subdifferentials relative to the given cone, we establish necessary dual conditions for the metric subregularity of such inequalities in Asplund spaces. The results based on Mordukhovich subdifferentials characterize Asplund spaces, while those based on Frechet subdifferentials yield necessary or sufficient conditions for Asplund spaces. These conditions recover, as special cases, the known error-bound results for inequalities defined by extended-real-valued functions on Asplund spaces.
Overall, this work highlights that the validity of necessary conditions formulated via normal cones and subdifferentials for error bounds of convex or nonconvex inequalities depends crucially on the Asplund property of the underlying space.

Part I of this work [Gao25] establishes online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online convex optimization to adapt stepsizes in gradient methods.

The resulting method, OSGM-Best, matches the performance of quasi-Newton variants while requiring less memory and cheaper iterations. We also extend OSGM to nonconvex optimization and outline directions that connect OSGM to existing branches of optimization theory and practice.

This paper extends the Concentration-Compactness Principle to Musielak-Orlicz spaces, working in both bounded and unbounded domains. We show that our results include important special cases like classical Orlicz spaces, variable exponent spaces, double phase spaces, and a new type of double phase problem where the exponents depend on the solution. Using these general results with variational methods, we prove that certain quasilinear equations with critical nonlinear terms have solutions.

Approximation in an optimal design problem governed by the heat equation
Kei Matsushima, Tomoyuki Oka
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper studies a two-material optimal design problem for the time-averaged duality pairing between a (possibly time-dependent) heat source and the weak solution of an initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation with a two-material diffusion coefficient, under a volume constraint. In general, such optimal designs are not guaranteed to exist, and geometric constraints such as the perimeter are required. As an approximation of the problem with an additional perimeter constraint, a material representation based on a level set function, together with a perturbation of the Dirichlet energy, is employed. It is then shown that optimal level set functions exist for the perturbation problem, and the corresponding minimum value converges to that of the elliptic case, thereby elucidating the long-time behavior. Furthermore, two-material domains satisfying this property are also constructed via the nonlinear diffusion-based level set method. In particular, the asymptotic behavior with respect to the perturbation parameter is clarified, and the validity of the approximation is established.

For a simple connected graph $G$ of order $n$, a bijective function $f:V(G)\to\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ is said to be a Legendre cordial labeling modulo $p$, where $p$ is an odd prime, if the induced function $f_p^*:E(G)\to \{0,1\}$, defined by $f_p^*(uv)=0$ whenever $([f(u)+f(v)]/p)=-1$ or $f(u)+f(v)\equiv 0(\text{mod }p)$, and $f_p^*(uv)=1$ whenever $([f(u)+f(v)]/p)=1$, satisfies the condition $|e_{f_p^*}(0)-e_{f_p^*}(1)|\leq 1$ where $e_{f_p^*}(i)$ is the number of edges with label $i$ ($i=0,1$). This paper investigates the Legendre cordial labeling of graphs obtained through various operations: join, corona, lexicographic product, cartesian product, tensor product, and strong product.

Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent Algorithm for Nonconvex Minimax Problems with Decision-Dependent Distributions
Yan Gao, Yongchao Liu

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we study stochastic minimax problems with decision-dependent distributions (SMDD), where the probability distribution of stochastic variable depends on decision variable. For SMDD with nonconvex-(strongly) concave objective function, we propose an adaptive stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm (ASGDA) to find the stationary points of SMDD, which learns the unknown distribution map dynamically and optimizes the minimax problem simultaneously. When the distribution map follows a location-scale model, we show that ASGDA finds an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{-\left(4+\delta\right)} \right)$ for $\forall\delta>0$, and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-8})$ stochastic gradient evaluations in nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave settings respectively. When the objective function of SMDD is nonconvex in $x$ and satisfies Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) inequality in $y$, we propose an alternating adaptive stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm (AASGDA) and show that AASGDA finds an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\kappa_y^4\epsilon^{-4})$ stochastic gradient evaluations, where $\kappa_y$ denotes the condition number. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.

This paper explores the application of Hurlbert's Linear Optimization Technique to determine bounds on pebbling numbers. By applying Hurlbert's weight functions and optimization methods, we derive upper bounds for specific graph families. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of these bounds and contributes to a broader understanding of pebbling numbers in graph theory. In particular, the weight function lemma is applied to calculate upper bounds for graphs such as the Petersen graph, the Bruhat graph, and various trees.

Final Exam Scheduling at Bucknell University: A Case Study and Open-Source Tool

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Problem Definition: Final exam scheduling is a common but challenging optimization problem. At Bucknell University, a small liberal arts institution, the problem is particularly complex and has historically required the Registrar's Office to spend months manually designing an exam schedule each semester.
Methodology: We worked in close collaboration with the Registrar's Office. First, we created visualization tools to help their manual scheduling process. Then we designed integer programming models and heuristics to produce a portfolio of possible exam schedules. Finally, we developed open-source, user-friendly software, enabling their office to directly produce and adjust these schedules.
Results and Managerial Implications: Our tools - both software and algorithms - are now in use at Bucknell University. This collaboration has led to both substantial time savings and improved schedules. Since the implementation of this project, for example, the proportion of students who have a back-to-back exam in a given semester has decreased from roughly a third to about 10%. Our tools are fully open-source and rely on an open-source optimization solver, and our approach garnered national media attention with an article in Inside Higher Ed.

Based on a study of a formula representing submodular set function as a supremum of measures dominated by the set function, we present a corresponding formula for a Choquet integration with respect to the set function, on a measurable space which has a chain of measurable set generating the sigma-algebra. As an application we reproduce a basic formula in mathematical finance on law invariant coherent risk measures. We also study a recursion relation of set functions for which the representation formula characterizes the fixed point.

The nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic approximation is widely studied under conditions of bounded variances in noise. Motivated by recent advances that allow for variability linked to the current state or time, we consider state- and time-dependent noises. We show that the Lyapunov function exhibits polynomial convergence rates in both cases, with the rate of polynomial delay depending on the parameters of state- or time-dependent noises. Notably, if the state noise parameters fully approach their limiting value, the Lyapunov function achieves an exponential convergence rate. We provide two numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings in the context of stochastic gradient descent with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and stochastic bilevel optimization.

Hybrid Quantum Branch-and-Bound Method for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
Zedong Peng, Daniel de Roux, David E. Bernal Neira
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Quantum algorithms have shown promise in solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, benefiting from their connection to the transverse field Ising model. Various Ising solvers, both classical and quantum, have emerged to tackle such problems efficiently but lack global optimality guarantees and often suffer from hardware limitations such as limited qubit availability. In this work, we propose a hybrid branch-and-bound (B&B) framework that integrates Ising solvers as heuristics within a classical B&B algorithm. Unlike prior theoretical studies, our work presents a practical implementation, available as open-source on GitHub. We explore when and where to apply Ising solvers in the search tree and introduce a custom branching rule optimized QUBO embedding. Our method is evaluated on hundreds of QUBO instances from this http URL using Gurobi and the D-Wave quantum annealer. Our results show up to 11% less solution time and 17% fewer nodes compared to default Gurobi, an off-the-shelf commercial optimization solver. These findings demonstrate the value of hybrid quantum-classical strategies for enhancing exact optimization.

A Proximal Stochastic Gradient Method with Adaptive Step Size and Variance Reduction for Convex Composite Optimization

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we propose a proximal stochasitc gradient algorithm (PSGA) for solving composite optimization problems by incorporating variance reduction techniques and an adaptive step-size strategy. In the PSGA method, the objective function consists of two components: one is a smooth convex function, and the other is a non-smooth convex function. We establish the strong convergence of the proposed method, provided that the smooth convex function is Lipschitz continuous. We also prove that the expected value of the error between the estimated gradient and the actual gradient converges to zero. Furthermore, we get an \( O(\sqrt{1/k}) \) convergence rate for our method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical experiments on Logistic regression and Lasso regression.

Rate-Distortion Limits for Multimodal Retrieval: Theory, Optimal Codes, and Finite-Sample Guarantees
Thomas Y. Chen

ICCV MRR 2025

We establish the first information-theoretic limits for multimodal retrieval. Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty $\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly. Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.

We construct global-in-time classical solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell system in a three-dimensional half-space beyond the vacuum scattering regime. Our approach combines the construction of stationary solutions to the associated boundary-value problem with a proof of their asymptotic dynamical stability in $L^\infty$ under small perturbations, providing a new framework for understanding long-time wave-particle interactions in the presence of boundaries and interacting magnetic fields. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first construction of asymptotically stable non-vacuum steady states under general perturbations in the full three-dimensional nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell system.

We establish existence and uniqueness of remotely almost periodic (RAP) solutions for nonlinear ordinary differential systems $x' = A(t)x + f(t,x) + g_{\nu}(t,x).$ Assuming that the linear equation $x' = A(t)x$ admits an exponential dichotomy and that the associated Green kernel is exponentially bi-remotely almost periodic, we derive sufficient conditions guaranteeing a unique RAP solution of the perturbed system for $\nu$ in a suitable range. As an application, we obtain RAP solutions for a nonautonomous Brusselator model.

A new proof on quasilinear Schrödinger equations with prescribed mass and combined nonlinearity
Jianhua Chen, Jijiang Sun, Chenggui Yuan, Jian Zhang
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this work, we study the quasilinear Schrödinger equation \begin{equation*} \aligned -\Delta u-\Delta(u^2)u=|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{q-2}u+\lambda u,\,\, x\in\R^N, \endaligned \end{equation*} under the mass constraint \begin{equation*} \int_{\R^N}|u|^2\text{d}x=a, \end{equation*} where $N\geq2$, $2<p<2+\frac{4}{N}<4+\frac{4}{N}<q<22^*$, $a>0$ is a given mass and $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier. As a continuation of our previous work (Chen et al., 2025, arXiv:2506.07346v1), we establish some results by means of a suitable change of variables as follows:
\begin{itemize} \item[{\bf(i) }] {\bf qualitative analysis of the constrained minimization}\\ For $2<p<4+\frac{4}{N}\leq q<22^*$, we provide a detailed study of the minimization problem under some appropriate conditions on $a>0$;
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize} \item[{\bf(ii)}]{\bf existence of two radial distinct normalized solutions}\\ For $2<p<2+\frac{4}{N}<4+\frac{4}{N}<q<22^*$, we obtain a local minimizer under the normalized constraint;\\ For $2<p<2+\frac{4}{N}<4+\frac{4}{N}<q\leq2^*$, we obtain a mountain pass type normalized solution distinct from the local minimizer.
\end{itemize} Notably, the second result {\bf (ii)} resolves the open problem {\bf(OP1)} posed by (Chen et al., 2025, arXiv:2506.07346v1). Unlike previous approaches that rely on constructing Palais-Smale-Pohozaev sequences by [Jeanjean, 1997, Nonlinear Anal. {\bf 28}, 1633-1659], we obtain the mountain pass solution employing a new method, which lean upon the monotonicity trick developed by (Chang et al., 2024, Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré C Anal. Non Linéaire, {\bf 41}, 933-959).
We emphasize that the methods developed in this work can be extended to investigate the existence of mountain pass-type normalized solutions for other classes of quasilinear Schrödinger equations.

Subjects:

We study the expressivity of rational neural networks (RationalNets) through the lens of algebraic geometry. We consider rational functions that arise from a given RationalNet to be tuples of fractions of homogeneous polynomials of fixed degrees. For a given architecture, the neuromanifold is the set of all such expressible tuples. For RationalNets with one hidden layer and fixed activation function $1/x$, we characterize the dimension of the neuromanifold and provide defining equations for some architectures. We also propose algorithms that determine whether a given rational function belongs to the neuromanifold. For deep binary RationalNets, i.e., RationalNets all of whose layers except potentially for the last one are binary, we classify when the Zarisky closure of the neuromanifold equals the whole ambient space, and give bounds on its dimensions.

In this short note, we give detailed proofs to show that the first 4 assertions dealing with index iterations in the total of 5 assertions in Theorem 3.3 of [CGG24] actually coincide completely with results in (ECIJT) of [DLW16]

Landmark MDS Revisited for Sensor Network Localization with Anchors
Ting Ouyang, Lingchen Kong, Houduo Qi
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The landmark multi-dimensional scaling (LMDS) is a leading method that embeds new points to an existing coordinate system based on observed distance information. It has long been known as a variant of Nyström algorithm. It was recently revealed that LMDS is Gower's method proposed in 1960s. However, the relationship with other range-based embedding methods including the least-squares (LS) has been unexplored, proposing the question of which method to use in practice. This paper provides a fresh look at those methods and explicitly differentiates them in terms of the objectives they try to minimize. For the first time for the case of single source localization, we show that both LMDS and LS are generated from a same family of objectives, which balance between length and angle preservation among the embedding points. Despite being nonconvex, the new objectives can be globally optimized through a trust-region method. An important result is that the LS solution can be thought as a regularized solution of LMDS. Extension to the case of multiple source localization is also explored. Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate the quality of the proposed objectives and the efficiency of the trust-region method.

On the planar free elastic flow with small oscillation of curvature

Comments:

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The free elastic flow that begins at any curve exists for all time. If the initial curve is an $\omega$-fold covered circle (``$\omega$-circle'') the solution expands self-similarly. Very recently, Miura and the second author showed that (topological) $\omega$-circles that are close to multiply-covered round circles are asymptotically stable under the planar free elastic flow, which means that upon rescaling the rescaled flow converges smoothly to the stationary (in the rescaled setting) $\omega$-circle. Closeness in that work was measured via the derivative of the curvature scalar. In the present paper, we improve this by requiring closeness in terms of the curvature scalar itself. The convergence rate we obtain is sharp.

A nonautonomous dynamical system $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})=\{(X_{k},T_{k})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}:X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$ along a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$. In this paper, we study the nonautonomous symbolic systems $(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(\boldsymbol{m}),\boldsymbol{\sigma})$ and nonautonomous expansive dynamical systems. We prove homogeneous properties and provide the formulae for topological pressures $\underline{P},\overline{P},P^{\mathrm{B}},P^{\mathrm{P}}$ on symbolic systems for potentials $\boldsymbol{f}=\{f_{k} \in C(\Sigma_{k}^{\infty}(\boldsymbol{m}),\mathbb{R})\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ with strongly bounded variation. We also give the formulae for the measure-theoretic pressures of nonautonomous Bernoulli measures and obtain equilibrium states in nonautonomous symbolic systems for certain classes of potentials. Finally, we prove the existence of generators for pressure in strongly uniformly expansive (sue) systems. We show that all nonautonomous sue systems have symbolic extensions, and that a class of nonautonomous sue systems on 0-topological-dimensional spaces $X_{k}$ may be embedded in autonomous systems.

In this article, we propose an efficient time-splitting Fourier pseudospectral method for the Wigner(-Poisson)-Fokker-Planck equations. The method achieves second-order accuracy in time and spectral accuracy in phase space, both of which are rigorously verified by numerical experiments. The validated scheme is then employed to study the long-time dynamics of these systems. We investigate the existence of steady states for both the Wigner-Fokker-Planck and Wigner-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equations. Notably, for the Wigner-Fokker-Planck system, our results provide numerical evidence for the existence of a steady state even when the external potential is far from harmonic. This is an important discovery, since this phenomenon has not been thoroughly established in theory.

New examples of words for which the binomial complexities and the subword complexity coincide
Léo Vivion
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The complexity of an infinite word can be measured in several ways, the two most common measures being the subword complexity and the abelian complexity. In 2015, Rigo and Salimov introduced a family of intermediate complexities indexed by $k\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$: the $k$-binomial complexities. These complexities scale up from the abelian complexity, with which the $1$-binomial complexity coincides, to the subword complexity, to which they converge pointwise as $k$ tends to $\infty$. In this article, we provide four classes of $d$-ary infinite words -- namely, $d$-ary $1$-balanced words, words with subword complexity $n\in\mathbb{N}_{>0}\mapsto n+(d-1)$ (which form a subclass of quasi-Sturmian words), hypercubic billiard words, and words obtained by coloring a Sturmian word with another Sturmian word -- for which this scale ``collapses'', that is, for which all $k$-binomial complexities, for $k\geq 2$, coincide with the subword complexity. This work generalizes a result of Rigo and Salimov, established in their seminal 2015 paper, which asserts that the $k$-binomial complexity of any Sturmian word coincides with its subword complexity whenever $k\geq 2$.

32 pages, 15 figures. Submitted to: Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Inverse problems aim to determine model parameters of a mathematical problem from given observational data. Neural networks can provide an efficient tool to solve these problems. In the context of Bayesian inverse problems, Uncertainty Quantification Variational AutoEncoders (UQ-VAE), a class of neural networks, approximate the posterior distribution mean and covariance of model parameters. This allows for both the estimation of the parameters and their uncertainty in relation to the observational data. In this work, we propose a novel loss function for training UQ-VAEs, which includes, among other modifications, the removal of a sample mean term from an already existing one. This modification improves the accuracy of UQ-VAEs, as the original theoretical result relies on the convergence of the sample mean to the expected value (a condition that, in high dimensional parameter spaces, requires a prohibitively large number of samples due to the curse of dimensionality). Avoiding the computation of the sample mean significantly reduces the training time in high dimensional parameter spaces compared to previous literature results. Under this new formulation, we establish a new theoretical result for the approximation of the posterior mean and covariance for general mathematical problems. We validate the effectiveness of UQ-VAEs through three benchmark numerical tests: a Poisson inverse problem, a non affine inverse problem and a 0D cardiocirculatory model, under the two clinical scenarios of systemic hypertension and ventricular septal defect. For the latter case, we perform forward uncertainty quantification.

We show that there is a large $x_0>0$ such that this inequality fails infinitely often for integers $x\ge x_0$. To this aim we analyze the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that, we see, becomes crucial.

Mechanical Proving the Symplecticity of Partitioned Runge--Kutta Methods for Determinate and Stochastic Hamiltonian Systems
Xiaojing Zhang
Subjects:

We propose a new method to prove the partitioned Runge--Kutta methods with symplectic conditions for determinate and stochastic Hamiltonian systems are symplectic. We utilize Gröbner basis technology which is the one of symbolic computation method based on computer algebra theory and geometrical mechanical proving theory. In this approach, from determinate Hamilton's equations, we get the relations of partial differentials which are regarded as polynomials of plenty variables marked indeterminates. Then, we compute the Gröbner basis of above polynomials, and the normal form of symplectic expression, which is as the middle expression, with respect to the Gröbner basis. Then, we compute the Gröbner basis of symplectic conditions and the normal form of the middle expression with respect to above Gröbner basis, and get that the normal form is zero, which complete the proof. We also develop this procedure to the stochastic Hamiltonian systems case and get similar result. In this paper, the new try provide us a new idea to prove the structure-preservation laws of another numerical methods, including the energy conservation law, the momentum conservation law and so on.

We study Chabauty limits of the fixed-point group of $k$-points $H_k$ associated with an involutive $k$-automorphism $\theta$ of a connected linear reductive group $G$ defined over a non-Archimedean local field $k$ of characteristic zero. Leveraging the geometry of the Bruhat--Tits building, the structure of $(\theta,k)$-split tori, and the $K\mathcal{B}_kH_k$ decomposition of $G_k$, we establish that any nontrivial Chabauty limit $L$ of $H_k$ is $G_k$-conjugate to a subgroup of $$U_{\sigma_+}(k) \rtimes (Ker(\alpha)^0 \cdot (H_k \cap M_{\sigma_{\pm}})) \leq P_{\sigma_+}(k),$$ where $\alpha$ is a projection map arising from a Levi factor $M_{\sigma_{\pm}}$ of a parabolic subgroup $P_{\sigma_+} \subset G$, and $Ker(\alpha)^0$ denotes the subgroup of elliptic elements in the kernel of $\alpha$. Our analysis distinguishes between elliptic and hyperbolic elements and constructs explicit unipotent elements in the limit group $L$ using the Moufang property of $G_k$. Furthermore, we show that $L$ acts transitively on the set of ideal simplices opposite to $\sigma_+$. These results yield a detailed description of the Chabauty compactification of $H_k$, and provide new insights into its interaction with the non-Archimedean geometry of $G_k$.

Gohberg-Krupnik Localisation for Discrete Wiener-Hopf Operators on Orlicz Sequence Spaces

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Let $\Phi$ be an $N$-function whose Matuszewska-Orlicz indices satisfy $1<\alpha_\Phi\le\beta_\Phi<\infty$. Using these indices, we introduce ``interpolation friendly" classes of Fourier multipliers $M_{[\Phi]}$ and $M_{\langle\Phi\rangle}$ such that $M_{[\Phi]}\subset M_{\langle\Phi\rangle}\subset M_\Phi$, where $M_\Phi$ is the Banach algebra of all Fourier multipliers on the reflexive Orlicz sequence space $\ell^\Phi(\mathbb{Z})$. Applying the Gohberg-Krupnik localisation in the corresponding Calkin algebra, the study of Fredholmness of the discrete Wiener-Hopf operator $T(a)$ with $a\in M_{\langle\Phi\rangle}$ is reduced to that of $T(a_\tau)$ for certain, potentially easier to study, local representatives $a_\tau\in M_{[\Phi]}$ of $a$ at all points $\tau\in[-\pi,\pi)$.

Sketches of Nonuniformly Elliptic Schauder Theory

Survey article for Proceedings of the 9th ECM
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Schauder theory is a basic tool in the study of elliptic and parabolic PDEs, asserting that solutions inherit the regularity of the coefficients. It plays a central role in establishing higher regularity for solutions to a broad class of elliptic problems exhibiting ellipticity, including those involving free boundaries. In the linear setting, Schauder theory dates back to the 1920-30s and is now considered classical. Nonlinear extensions were developed in the 1980s. All these classical results are restricted to uniformly elliptic operators and heavily rely on perturbative techniques - freezing the coefficients and comparing the solution to that of a constant-coefficient problem. However, such methods fail in the nonuniformly elliptic setting, where homogeneous a priori estimates break down and standard iteration arguments no longer apply. Here we give a brief survey on recent progresses including the solution to the longstanding problem of proving the validity of Schauder estimates in the nonlinear, nonuniformly elliptic setting.

Dynamic modeling and simulation of an electric flash clay calcination plant for green cement production

Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We present a novel dynamic model of an electric flash clay calcination plant. Calcined kaolinite-rich clay has been identified as one of the most effective candidates for supplementary cementitious material (SCM), because of its large availability. Calcination of clay is achieved via the dehydroxylation reaction, which does not release CO2 (unlike limestone), but has a considerable energy requirement. The required high temperature can be met by electric resistive heating of the working gas in the plant, that can be powered by renewable energy. Therefore, CO2-free calcination of clay can be achieved. Up to 50\% of the limestone-based clinker can be substituted by calcined clay (CC), making the cement more sustainable. We consider a plant that consists of gas-material cyclones that pre-heat the clay, a calciner, and a gas-recirculation system with electric heating of the gas. The model is formulated as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The model consists of thermophysical properties, reaction kinetics and stoichiometry, transport, mass and energy balances, and algebraic constraints. The model can be used to perform dynamic simulations with changing inputs, process design, and optimization. Moreover, it can be used to develop model-based control, which is relevant for flexible operation of a clay calcination plant for green cement production.

Dynamical Low-Rank Approximations for Kalman Filtering
Fabio Nobile, Thomas Trigo Trindade
Comments:
50 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose a dynamical low rank approximation of the Kalman-Bucy process (DLR-KBP), which evolves the filtering distribution of a partially continuously observed linear SDE on a small time-varying subspace at reduced computational cost. This reduction is valid in presence of small noise and when the filtering distribution concentrates around a low dimensional subspace. We further extend this approach to a DLR-ENKF process, where particles are evolved in a low dimensional time-varying subspace at reduced cost. This allows for a significantly larger ensemble size compared to standard EnKF at equivalent cost, thereby lowering the Monte Carlo error and improving filter accuracy. Theoretical properties of the DLR-KBP and DLR-ENKF are investigated, including a propagation of chaos property. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.

A note on disjointness and discrete elements in partially ordered vector spaces
Jani Jokela

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
The notions of disjointness and discrete elements play a prominent role in the classical theory of vector lattices. There are at least three different generalizations of the notion of disjointness to a larger class of partially ordered vector spaces. In recent years, one of these generalizations has been widely studied in the context of pre-Riesz spaces. The notion of $D$-disjointness is the most general of the three disjointness concepts. In this paper we study $D$-disjointness and the related concept of a $D$-discrete element. We establish some basic properties of $D$-discrete elements in Archimedean partially ordered spaces, and we investigate their relationship to discrete elements in the theory of pre-Riesz spaces.

A note on finding optimal cut-offs
Shravan Mohan
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper addresses the challenge of determining optimal cut-offs for a set of n items with m scores to maximize distinguishability. The term distinguishability is defined as the fraction of item pairs assigned to different buckets, where buckets are determined by the number of cut-offs an items scores exceed. A brute-force approach to this problem is computationally intractable, with complexity growing exponentially with the number of scores. On the other hand, attempts to solve the problem in the continuous domain lead to local minima, making it unreliable. To overcome these challenges, the problem is formulated as a Integer Quadratic Program (IQP). Since IQPs become computationally difficult with even moderate size problems, a surrogate Integer Linear Program (ILP) is introduced, which can be solved more efficiently for larger instances. In addition to these exact methods, a simple heuristic is proposed that offers a balance between solution quality and computational efficiency. This heuristic iteratively adjusts cutoffs for each score, considering a finite-set of meaningful cut-off points. Computational results provide an empirically evidence for the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

This paper compares the performance of a decentralized proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, a linear model predictive controller (LMPC), and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) applied to a quadruple tank system (QTS). We present experimental data from a physical setup of the QTS as well as simulation results. The QTS is modeled as a stochastic nonlinear continuous-discrete-time system, with parameters estimated using a maximum-likelihood prediction-error-method (ML-PEM). The NMPC applies the stochastic nonlinear continuous-discrete-time model, while the LMPC uses a linearized version of the same model. We tune the decentralized PID controller using the simple internal model control (SIMC) rules. The SIMC rules require transfer functions of the process, and we obtain these from the linearized model. We compare the controller performances based on systematic tests using both the physical setup and the simulated QTS. We measure the performance in terms of tracking errors and rate of movement in the manipulated variables. The LMPC and the NMPC perform better than the decentralized PID control system for tracking pre-announced time-varying setpoints. For disturbance rejection, the MPCs perform only slightly better than the decentralized PID controller. The primary advantage of the MPCs is their ability to use the information of future setpoints. We demonstrate this by providing simulation results of the MPCs with and without such information. Finally, the NMPC achieves slightly improved tracking errors compared to the LMPC but at the expense of having a higher input rate of movement.

Geometry of linearly stable coherent systems over curves

Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Let $E$ be a vector bundle over a smooth curve $C$, and $V$ a generating space of sections of $E$. We characterise Mumford linear stability of the associated projective model of $\mathbb{P} E^\vee$ in $\mathbb{P} V^\vee$ in terms of geometric and cohomological properties of the coherent system $(E, V)$, and give some applications. We show that any $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$-bundle over $C$ has a linearly stable model in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ for any $n \ge r+2$. Furthermore; linear stability of $(E, V)$ is a necessary condition for stability of the kernel bundle $M_{E, V}$ of $(E, V)$, which is predicted by Butler's conjecture for general $C$ and $(E, V)$. We give new examples showing that it is not in general sufficient; in particular, a general bundle $E$ of large degree fits into a linearly stable coherent system $(E, V)$ with nonsemistable kernel bundle. Finally, we use these ideas to show the stability of $M_{E, V}$ for certain $(E, V)$ of type $(r, d, r+2)$ where $E$ is not necessarily stable.

\left(1 - q^n \right)^{-f_{\ell}(n)},\quad (\ell \in \mathbb{N}, f_1\equiv 1). \end{equation*} We take the product over $1\in S \subset \mathbb{N}$ and denote the complement by $E$, the set of exceptions. In the case of $\ell=1$ and $E$ the multiples of $k$, $p_{E,1}\left( n\right) $ represents the number of $k$-regular partitions. More generally, let $f_{\ell}$ satisfy a certain growth condition. We determine the signs of $\Delta _{E,\ell }(n)$ for $\ell$ large. The signs mainly depend on the occurrence of subsets of $\{2,3,4,5\}$ as a part of the exception set and the residue class of $n$ modulo $ r$, where $r $ depends on $E$. For example, let $2,3 \in S$ and $4$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) >0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} If we assume $3,4 \in S$ and $2$ an exception. Let $n$ be large. Then for almost all $\ell$ we have \begin{equation*} \Delta _{E,\ell }(n) < 0 \,\,\, \text{ for } n\equiv 2 \pmod{3}. \end{equation*} Note that this property is independent of the integers $k\in S,k>4$.

In [Jalowy, Kabluchko, Marynych, arXiv:2504.11593v1, 2025], the authors discuss a user-friendly approach to determine the limiting empirical zero distribution of a sequence of real-rooted polynomials, as the degree goes to $\infty$. In this note, we aim to apply it to a vast range of examples of polynomials providing a unifying source for limiting empirical zero distributions.
We cover Touchard, Fubini, Eulerian, Narayana and little $q$-Laguerre polynomials as well as hypergeometric polynomials including the classical Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. We construct polynomials whose empirical zero distributions converge to the free multiplicative normal and Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we study polynomials generated by some differential operators. As one inverse result, we derive coefficient asymptotics of the characteristic polynomial of random covariance matrices.

From PowerSGD to PowerSGD+: Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Optimization with Convergence Guarantees

Low-rank gradient compression methods, such as PowerSGD, have gained attention in communication-efficient distributed optimization. However, the convergence guarantees of PowerSGD remain unclear, particularly in stochastic settings. In this paper, we show that PowerSGD does not always converge to the optimal solution and provide a clear counterexample to support this finding. To address this, we introduce PowerSGD+, which periodically updates the projection subspace via singular value decomposition, ensuring that it remains aligned with the optimal subspace. We prove that PowerSGD+ converges under standard assumptions and validate its effectiveness through empirical evaluation on large language model tasks.

Limit Theorems for Verbose Persistence Diagrams

Comments:

Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Probability (math.PR)
The persistence diagram is a central object in the study of persistent homology and has also been investigated in the context of random topology. The more recent notion of the verbose diagram (a.k.a. verbose barcode) is a refinement of the persistence diagram that is obtained by incorporating ephemeral persistence features as extra points along the diagonal. In this work, we initiate the study of random verbose diagrams. We establish a strong law of large numbers for verbose diagrams as a random point cloud grows in size -- that is, we prove the existence of a limiting verbose diagram, viewed as a measure on the half-plane on and above the diagonal. Also, we characterize its support and compute its total mass. Along the way, we extend the notion of the persistent Betti number, reveal the relation between this extended notion and the verbose diagram (which is an extension of the fundamental lemma of persistent homology), and establish results on the asymptotic behavior of the extended persistent Betti numbers.
This work extends the main results of the work by Hiraoka, Shirai, and Trinh and its sequel by Shirai and Suzaki to the setting of verbose diagrams.

A caustic of a billiard is a curve whose tangent lines are reflected to its own tangent lines. A billiard is called Birkhoff caustic-integrable, if there exists a topological annulus adjacent to its boundary from inside that is foliated by closed caustics. The famous Birkhoff Conjecture, studied by many mathematicians, states that the only Birkhoff caustic-integrable billiards are ellipses. The conjecture is open even for billiards whose boundaries are ovals of algebraic curves. In this case the billiard is known to have a dense family of so-called rational caustics that are also ovals of algebraic curves. We introduce the notion of a complex caustic: a complex algebraic curve whose complex tangent lines are sent by complexified reflection to its own complex tangent lines. We show that the usual billiard on a real planar curve $\gamma$ has a complex caustic, if and only if $\gamma$ is a conic. We prove analogous result for billiards on all the surfaces of constant curvature. These results are corollaries of the solution of this http URL's polynomial integrability conjecture: a joint result by this http URL, this http URL and the author. We extend them to the projective billiards introduced by this http URL, which are a common generalization of billiards on surfaces of constant curvature. We also deal with a well-known class of projective billiards on conics that are defined to have caustics forming a dual conical pencil. We show that up to restriction to a finite union of arcs, each of them is equivalent to a billiard on appropriate surface of constant curvature.

For initial density allowed to vanish, the global existence and large time asymptotic behavior of strong and weak solutions are established, provided the shear viscosity is a positive constant and the bulk one is a power function of density with the power bigger than four-thirds. It should be noted that this result is obtained without any restrictions on the size of initial data.

Infinitely many solutions to a conformally invariant elliptic equation with Choquard-type nonlinearity
Mona Almutairi, Mathew Gluck
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The existence of an unbounded sequence of solutions to a conformally invariant elliptic equation having nonlocal critical-power nonlinearity is established. The primary obstacle to establishing existence of solutions is the failure of compactness in the Sobolev embedding. To overcome this obstacle, the problem under consideration is lifted to an equivalent problem on the standard sphere so that the symmetries of the sphere can be leveraged. Two classes of symmetries are considered and for each class of symmetries, an unbounded sequence of solutions to the lifted problem with the prescribed symmetries is produced. One class of symmetries always exists and the corresponding solutions are guaranteed to be sign-changing whenever a suitable relationship between the dimension and the nonlocality parameter holds. The other class of symmetries need not always exist but when it exists, the corresponding solutions are guaranteed to be sign-changing.

We compute the cohomology of the quotient algebra $\mathcal{A}(2)$ of the $\mathbb{R}$-motivic dual Steenrod algebra. We do so by running a $\rho$-Bockstein spectral sequence whose input is the cohomology of $\mathbb{C}$-motivic $\mathcal{A}(2)$. The purpose of our computation is that the cohomology of $\mathcal{A}(2)$ is the input to an Adams spectral sequence of a hypothetical $\mathbb{R}$-motivic modular forms spectrum. This Adams spectral sequence computes the homotopy groups of such an $\mathbb{R}$-motivic modular forms spectrum, which in turn can be used to make inferences about the homotopy groups of the $\mathbb{R}$-motivic sphere spectrum and eventually about the classical stable stems.

GP-CMRH: An inner product free iterative method for block two-by-two nonsymmetric linear systems

We propose an inner product free iterative method called GP-CMRH for solving block two-by-two nonsymmetric linear systems. GP-CMRH relies on a new simultaneous Hessenberg process that reduces two rectangular matrices to upper Hessenberg form simultaneously, without employing inner products. Compared with GPMR [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 44 (2023), pp. 293--311], GP-CMRH requires less computational cost per iteration and may be more suitable for high performance computing and low or mixed precision arithmetic due to its inner product free property. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that GP-CMRH and GPMR exhibit comparable convergence behavior (with GP-CMRH requiring slightly more iterations), yet GP-CMRH consumes less computational time in most cases. GP-CMRH significantly outperforms GMRES and CMRH in terms of convergence rate and runtime efficiency.

A conjecture related to the Newman phase
Shravan Mohan
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
A conjecture is proposed concerning the recovery of a discrete magnitude spectrum through a nonlinear transformation involving the Newman's phase sequence. Given a discrete magnitude spectrum sampled from a continuous function, consider the process of applying a complex exponential with the Newman's phase sequence, computing the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IFFT), taking the absolute value of the result, and reversing the time-domain signal. The conjecture states that Newman's phase sequence, defined by a formula $\phi^{(N)}[k] = \frac{\pi (k-1)^2}{N}$, asymptotically recovers the original magnitude spectrum as the number of samples $N \to \infty$. Notably, the phase sequence is also independent of the input signal and is unique up to an overall constant phase shift. The broader implications of this conjecture remain to be fully understood, but the phenomenon raises fundamental questions about the role of phase in nonlinear spectral recovery.

Ancona inequalities along generic geodesic rays

Comments:
60 pages, 13 figures
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
This paper presents several versions of the Ancona inequality for finitely supported, irreducible random walks on non-amenable groups. We first study a class of Morse subsets with narrow points and prove the Ancona inequality around these points in any finitely generated non-amenable group. This result implies the inequality along all Morse geodesics and recovers the known case for relatively hyperbolic groups.
We then consider any geometric action of a non-amenable group with contracting elements. For such groups, we construct a class of generic geodesic rays, termed proportionally contracting rays, and establish the Ancona inequality along a sequence of good points. This leads to an embedding of a full-measure subset of the horofunction boundary into the minimal Martin boundary.
A stronger Ancona inequality is established for groups acting geometrically on an irreducible CAT(0) cube complex with a Morse hyperplane. In this setting, we show that the orbital maps extend continuously to a partial boundary map from a full-measure subset of the Roller boundary into the minimal Martin boundary. Finally, we provide explicit examples, including right-angled Coxeter groups (RACGs) defined by an irreducible graph with at least one vertex not belonging to any induced 4-cycle.

Reverse Hurwitz counts of genus 1 curves

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In this paper, we study a problem that is in a sense a reversal of the Hurwitz counting problem. The Hurwitz problem asks: for a generic target -- $\mathbb P^1$ with a list of $n$ points $q_1,\dots,q_n\in \mathbb P^1$ -- and partitions $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$ of $d$, how many degree $d$ covers $C\to\mathbb P^1$ are there with specified ramification $\sigma_i$ over $q_i$? We ask: for a generic source -- an $r$-pointed curve $(C,p_1,\dots,p_r)$ of genus $1$ -- and partitions $\mu, \sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$ of $d$ with $\ell(\mu)=r$, how many degree $d$ covers $C\to\mathbb P^1$ are there with ramification profile $\mu$ over $0$ corresponding to a fiber $\{p_1,\dots,p_r\}$ and elsewhere ramification profiles $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n$?
While the enumerative invariants we study bear a similarity to generalized Tevelev degrees, they are more difficult to express in closed form in general. Nonetheless, we establish key results: after proving a closed form result in the case where the only non-simple unmarked ramification profiles $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are ``even'' (consisting of $2,\dots,2$), we go on to establish recursive formulas to compute invariants where each unmarked ramification profile is of the form $(x,1,\dots,1)$. A special case asks: given a generic $d$-pointed genus $1$ curve $(E,p_1,\dots,p_d)$, how many degree $d$ covers $(E,p_1,\dots,p_d)\to(\mathbb P^1,0)$ are there with $d-2$ unspecified points of $E$ having ramification index $3$? We show that the answer is an explicit quartic in $d$.

In this paper, we prove that Temple's cylindrical future null coordinate charts can be constructed uniformly and we estimate the gradients of their optical functions. We then apply these charts to study a spacetime $(N,g)$ that has been converted into a definite metric space $(N,\hat{d}_\tau)$, where $\hat{d}_\tau$ is the null distance of Sormani and Vega defined using a locally anti-Lipschitz (in the sense of Chrusciel, Grant, and Minguzzi) generalized time function $\tau$. In particular, in the case when $\tau$ is Lipschitz we prove that $(N, \hat{d}_\tau)$ is a rectifiable metric space, where the causal structure is locally encoded by $\tau$ and $\hat{d}_\tau$. As a consequence, applying a classical theorem of Hawking and following a technique developed by Sakovich and Sormani, we can prove a Lorentzian isometry theorem, generalizing our earlier result.

It is natural to consider extending the typical construction of relative Poisson algebras from commutative differential algebras to the context of bialgebras. The known bialgebra structures for relative Poisson algebras, namely relative Poisson bialgebras, are equivalent to Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras with respect to the symmetric bilinear forms which are invariant on both the commutative associative and Lie algebras. However, they are not consistent with commutative and cocommutative differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras as the bialgebra structures for commutative differential algebras. Alternatively, with the invariance replaced by the commutative $2$-cocycles on the Lie algebras, the corresponding Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras are proposed, which are shown to be equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely relative PCA bialgebras. They serve as another approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras, which can be naturally constructed from commutative and cocommutative differential ASI bialgebras. The notion of the relative PCA Yang-Baxter equation (RPCA-YBE) in a relative PCA algebra is introduced, whose antisymmetric solutions give coboundary relative PCA bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators of relative PCA algebras and relative pre-PCA algebras are also introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPCA-YBE.

We use the method of vector fields to obtain a Liouville-type theorem for a class of quasilinear p-Laplace type equations with conormal boundary condition in the half space. These p-Laplace type equations are the subcritical case of the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Sobolev trace inequality in the half space.

Derivative-informed Graph Convolutional Autoencoder with Phase Classification for the Lifshitz-Petrich Model
Yanlai Chen, Yajie Ji, Zhenli Xu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The Lifshitz-Petrich (LP) model is a classical model for describing complex spatial patterns such as quasicrystals and multiphase structures. Solving and classifying the solutions of the LP model is challenging due to the presence of high-order gradient terms and the long-range orientational order characteristic of the quasicrystals. To address these challenges, we propose a Derivative-informed Graph Convolutional Autoencoder (DiGCA) to classify the multi-component multi-state solutions of the LP model. The classifier consists of two stages. In the offline stage, the DiGCA phase classifier innovatively incorporates both solutions and their derivatives for training a graph convolutional autoencoder which effectively captures intricate spatial dependencies while significantly reducing the dimensionality of the solution space. In the online phase, the framework employs a neural network classifier to efficiently categorize encoded solutions into distinct phase diagrams. The numerical results demonstrate that the DiGCA phase classifier accurately solves the LP model, classifies its solutions, and rapidly generates detailed phase diagrams in a robust manner, offering significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods.

Rings Whose Units Have Identity Plus Quasi-Nilpotent Square

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
In this paper, we investigate the structural and characterizing properties of the so-called {\it 2-UQ rings}, that are rings such that the square of every unit is the sum of an idempotent and a quasi-nilpotent element that commute with each other. We establish some fundamental connections between 2-UQ rings and relevant widely classes of rings including 2-UJ, 2-UU and tripotent rings. Our novel results include: (1) complete characterizations of 2-UQ group rings, showing that they force underlying groups to be either 2-groups or 3-groups when $3 \in J(R)$; (2) Morita context extensions preserving the 2-UQ property when trace ideals are nilpotent; and (3) the discovery that potent 2-UQ rings are precisely the semi-tripotent rings. Furthermore, we determine how the 2-UQ property interacts with the regularity, cleanness and potent conditions. Likewise, certain examples and counter-examples illuminate the boundaries between 2-UQ rings and their special relatives.
These achievements of ours somewhat substantially expand those obtained by Cui-Yin in Commun. Algebra (2020) and by Danchev {\it et al.} in J. Algebra \& Appl. (2025).

Ergodic approach to the study of boundedness of solutions of one type of the first-order semilinear difference equations

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We investigate the sufficient conditions for boundedness of one type of difference equations of the form $x(n+1)=ax(n)+f(x(n)) + y(n), \ n\geq 1$ in critical case $|a|=1$.
For this equation the following assumptions are introduced:
1) The function $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ and the input sequence $\{y(n)\}_{n\geq1}$ are assumed to be bounded.
2) $\text{Re}\left(\overline{f(\rho \, e^{2\pi i \theta})} \; \cdot ae^{2\pi i \theta}\right)$ converges uniformly on $[0,1) \ni \theta$ to some real-valued function $\Phi(\theta)$ as $\rho \to +\infty$ .
Combining the celebrated results of the probability and ergodic theory together with the geometric consideration of the problem, we show that under fairly general conditions this type of semilinear difference equations has all the solutions bounded.
Subsequently we formulate the quantitative version of our theorem and give the example of its application.
In addition, in the last section we discuss the conditions of our main result and provide the constructions, which highlight the importance of these conditions.

We prove that every functor from the category of Hilbert spaces and linear isometric embeddings to the category of sets which preserves directed colimits must be essentially constant on all infinite-dimensional spaces. In other words, every finitary set-valued imaginary over the theory of Hilbert spaces, in a broad signature-independent sense, must be essentially trivial. This extends a result and answers a question by Lieberman--Rosický--Vasey, who showed that no such functor on the supercategory of Hilbert spaces and injective linear contractions can be faithful.

Tight complexity bounds for diagram commutativity verification

Comments:

Combinatorics (math.CO); Category Theory (math.CT)
A diagram $\mathcal{D} = (G, l)$ over a monoid $M$ is an oriented graph $G = (V, E)$ endowed with a labeling $l\colon E \to M$. A diagram is commutative if and only if for any two oriented paths with the same endpoints, the products in $M$ of their edge labels coincide. We propose the first asymptotically optimal algorithm for diagram commutativity verification applicable to all graph families. For graphs with $\lvert V\rvert \preceq \lvert E\rvert \preceq \lvert V\rvert^2$, which covers most practically relevant cases, our algorithm runs in $$ O\bigl(|V|\,|E|\bigr) \cdot \bigl(T_{\mathrm{equal}} + T_{\mathrm{multi}}\bigr) $$ time; here $T_{\mathrm{equal}}$ and $T_{\mathrm{multi}}$ denote the times to perform an equality check and a multiplication in $M$, respectively. We also establish new lower bounds on the numbers of equality checks and multiplications necessary for commutativity verification, which asymptotically match our algorithm's cost and thus prove its tightness.

In 1989, A. J. Duran [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 107 (1989), 731-741] showed, that for every complex sequence $(s_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$ there exists a Schwartz function $f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{C})$ with $\mathrm{supp}\, f\subseteq [0,\infty)^n$ such that $s_\alpha = \int x^\alpha\cdot f(x)~\mathrm{d}x$ for all $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n$. It has been claimed to be a generalization of the result by T. Sherman [Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 13 (1964), 273-278], that every complex sequences is represented by a complex measure on $[0,\infty)^n$. In the present work we use the convolution of sequences and measures to show, that Duran's result is a trivial consequence of Sherman's result. We use our easy proof to extend the Schwartz function result and to show the flexibility in choosing very specific functions $f$.

Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple graph. A subset $S \subseteq V$ is called a $k$-fair dominating set if every vertex not in $S$ has exactly $k$ neighbors in $S$. Two disjoint sets $A, B \subseteq V$ form a $k$-fair coalition of $G$ if neither $A$ nor $B$ is a $k$-fair dominating set and the union $A \cup B$ is a $k$-fair dominating set of $G$. A partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_m\}$ of $V$ is called a $k$-fair coalition partition, if every set $V_i\in\pi$, either $V_i$ is a $k$-fair dominating set with exactly $k$ vertices, or $V_i$ is not a $k$-fair dominating set, but forms a $k$-fair coalition with some other set $V_j$ in $\pi$. The $k$-fair coalition number $C_{kf}(G)$ is the largest possible size of a $k$-fair coalition partition for $G$. The objective of this study is to initiate an examination into the notion of $k$-fair coalitions in graphs and present essential findings.

Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex simple graph with adjacency matrix $A_G$. The complement rank of $G$ is defined as $\operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. In this paper we study Nordhaus--Gaddum type bounds for the complement rank. We prove that for every graph $G$, $$ \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)\cdot\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \ge n, \qquad \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)+\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \ge n+1, $$ with the equality cases characterized. We further obtain strengthened multiplicative lower bounds under additional structural assumptions. Finally, we show that the trivial upper bounds $$ \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)\cdot\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \le n^2, \qquad \operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)+\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I) \le 2n $$ are tight by explicitly constructing, for every $n\ge 4$, graphs $G$ with $\operatorname{rank}(A_G+I)=\operatorname{rank}(A_{\overline G}+I)=n$.

This paper investigates the regularity of solutions and structural properties of the free boundary for a class of fourth-order elliptic problems with Neumann-type boundary conditions. The singular and degenerate elliptic operators studied naturally emerge from the extension procedure for higher-order fractional powers of the Laplacian, while the choice of non-linearity considered encompasses two-phase boundary obstacle problems as a special case. After establishing local regularity properties of solutions, Almgren- and Monneau-type monotonicity formulas are derived and utilized to carry out a blow-up analysis and prove a stratification result for the free boundary.

The Honest Truth About Causal Trees: Accuracy Limits for Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation

Recursive decision trees have emerged as a leading methodology for heterogeneous causal treatment effect estimation and inference in experimental and observational settings. These procedures are fitted using the celebrated CART (Classification And Regression Tree) algorithm [Breiman et al., 1984], or custom variants thereof, and hence are believed to be "adaptive" to high-dimensional data, sparsity, or other specific features of the underlying data generating process. Athey and Imbens [2016] proposed several "honest" causal decision tree estimators, which have become the standard in both academia and industry. We study their estimators, and variants thereof, and establish lower bounds on their estimation error. We demonstrate that these popular heterogeneous treatment effect estimators cannot achieve a polynomial-in-$n$ convergence rate under basic conditions, where $n$ denotes the sample size. Contrary to common belief, honesty does not resolve these limitations and at best delivers negligible logarithmic improvements in sample size or dimension. As a result, these commonly used estimators can exhibit poor performance in practice, and even be inconsistent in some settings. Our theoretical insights are empirically validated through simulations.

Efficient Algorithms for Partitioning Circulant Graphs with Optimal Spectral Approximation
Surya Teja Gavva, Peng Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)
The Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem (Annals of Mathematics, 2015) for the Kadison-Singer conjecture implies the following result in spectral graph theory: For any undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with a maximum edge effective resistance at most $\alpha$, there exists a partition of its edge set $E$ into $E_1 \cup E_2$ such that the two edge-induced subgraphs of $G$ spectrally approximates $(1/2)G$ with a relative error $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$. However, the proof of this theorem is non-constructive. It remains an open question whether such a partition can be found in polynomial time, even for special classes of graphs.
In this paper, we explore polynomial-time algorithms for partitioning circulant graphs via partitioning their generators. We develop an efficient algorithm that partitions a circulant graph whose generators form an arithmetic progression, with an error matching that in the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem and optimal, up to a constant. On the other hand, we prove that if the generators of a circulant graph are ``far" from an arithmetic progression, no partition of the generators can yield two circulant subgraphs with an error matching that in the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem.
In addition, we extend our algorithm to Cayley graphs whose generators are from a product of multiple arithmetic progressions.

Prioritizing Recurrent Services

Subjects:

We study optimal scheduling in multi-class queueing systems with reentrance, where jobs may return for additional service after completion. Such reentrance creates feedback loops that fundamentally alter congestion dynamics and challenge classical scheduling results. We model two distinct dimensions of the reentrance behavior, the probability of return and the speed of return, and show that their product, the effective return rate, is the key statistic that governs optimal priorities. Our main result establishes a dichotomy: when the effective return rate of the smaller job class (the class with lower expected total workload) is lower, a fixed priority rule is optimal; when it is higher, fixed rules are suboptimal and the optimal policy must be state dependent. This characterization clarifies how reentrance changes the externalities that jobs impose on one another and provides structural guidance for designing scheduling policies.

The Horton-Strahler number of butterfly trees

Subjects:

The Horton-Strahler number (HS) is a measure of branching complexity of rooted trees, introduced in hydrology and later studied in parallel computing under the name register function. While its order of growth is well understood for classical random trees, fluctuation behavior has largely resisted analysis. In this work we investigate the HS in the setting of butterfly trees -- binary trees constructed from butterfly permutations, a rich class of separable permutations with origins in numerical linear algebra and parallel architectures. For the subclass of simple butterfly trees, we exploit their recursive gluing structure to model the HS as an additive functional of a finite-state Markov process. This framework yields sharp distributional results, including a law of large numbers and a Central Limit Theorem with explicit variance growth, providing what appears to be the first genuine Gaussian limit law for the HS in a nontrivial random tree model. Extending to biased constructions, we further establish functional limit theorems via analytic and probabilistic tools. For general butterfly trees, while exact analysis remains open, empirical sampling shows that the HS distribution is confined to a narrower support than in classical models, and appears to concentrate tightly near the upper bound $\lfloor \log_4 N\rfloor$.

A new approach to rational stable parametrized homotopy theory

This work develops a comprehensive algebraic model for rational stable parametrized homotopy theory over arbitrary base spaces. Building on the simplicial analogue of the foundational framework of May-Sigurdsson for parametrized spectra, and the homotopy theory of complete differential graded Lie algebras, we construct an explicit sequence of Quillen equivalences that translate the homotopy theory of rational spectra of retractive simplicial sets into the purely algebraic framework of complete differential graded modules over the completed universal enveloping algebra $\widehat{UL}$ of a Lie model $L$ of the base simplicial set $B$. Explicitly, there is a sequence of Quillen adjunctions $$ \mathbf{Sp}_B \leftrightarrows \mathbf{Sp}_L \leftrightarrows \mathbf{Sp}_{\widehat{UL}}^0 \leftrightarrows
\mathbf{cdgm}_{\widehat{UL}} $$ which induces a natural, strong monoidal equivalence of categories $$
{\rm Ho}\,\mathbf{Sp}_B^{\Bbb Q}\cong {\rm Ho}\, \mathbf{cdgm}_{\widehat{UL}}.
$$ This equivalence is highly effective in practice as it provides direct computational access to invariants of simplicial spectra by translating them into homotopy invariants of $\widehat{UL}$-modules. Here $\mathbf{Sp}_B$ denotes the stable model category of spectra of retractive simplicial sets over $B$, $\mathbf{Sp}_L$ denotes the stable model category of spectra of retractive complete differential graded Lie algebras over $L$, $\mathbf{Sp}_{\widehat{UL}}^0$ denotes the stable model category of connected $\widehat{UL}$-module spectra, and $\mathbf{cdgm}_{\widehat{UL}}$ denotes the category of complete differential graded $\widehat{UL}$-modules.

Various card tricks involve under-down dealing, where alternatively one card is placed under the deck and the next card is dealt. We study how the cards need to be prepared in the deck to be dealt in order. The order in which the $N$ cards are prepared defines a permutation.
In this work, we analyze general dealing patterns, considering properties of the resulting permutations. We give recursive formulas for these permutations, their inverses, the final dealt card, and the dealing order of the first card. We discuss some particular examples of dealing patterns and conclude with an analysis of several existing and novel magic card tricks making use of dealing patterns. Our discussions involve 30 existing sequences in the OEIS, and we introduce 44 new sequences to that database.

This note revisits stability conditions on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on irreducible projective curves. In particular, all stability conditions on smooth curves are classified and a connected component of the stability manifold containing all the geometric stability conditions is identified for singular curves. On smooth curves of positive genus, the set of all non-locally-finite stability conditions gives a partial boundary of any known compactification of the stability manifold. To provide the full boundary, a notion of weak stability condition is proposed based on the definition of Collins--Lo--Shi--Yau and is classified for smooth curves of positive genus. On singular curves, the connected component containing geometric stability conditions is shown to be preserved by the two natural actions on the stability manifold.

IGA-LBM: Isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method
Ye Ji, Monica Lacatus, Matthias Möller
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The lattice Boltzmann method has become a widely adopted approach in computational fluid dynamics, offering unique advantages in mesoscopic kinetic modeling, intrinsic parallelism, and simple treatment of boundary conditions. However, its conventional reliance on Cartesian grids fundamentally limits geometric fidelity in flows involving curved boundaries, introducing stair-step artifacts that propagate as spurious forces and boundary-layer inaccuracies.
To address these challenges, we propose the isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method, which seamlessly integrates Isogeometric Analysis with LBM, leveraging the geometric precision of non-uniform rational B-Splines to construct body-fitted computational grids. Unlike conventional Cartesian-based LBM, the proposed approach eliminates stair-step boundary artifacts by providing sub-element geometric accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of LBM. Furthermore, the higher-order continuity of NURBS improves gradient resolution, reducing numerical diffusion in high-Reynold's-number flows. The parametric grid adaptation of IGA enables $h$-, $p$-, and $k$-refinement strategies, allowing for localized resolution enhancement in boundary layers and regions with high solution gradients. Additionally, the diffeomorphic mapping properties of IGA ensure intrinsic conservation, preserving advection invariants and suppressing numerical oscillations, leading to enhanced stability.
Benchmark simulations on flows with curved and complex geometries demonstrate that IGA-LBM delivers significantly more accurate boundary-layer predictions and pressure/force estimates than standard Cartesian LBM, while preserving its computational efficiency and scalability. By combining geometric exactness with the algorithmic simplicity of LBM, IGA-LBM offers a practical route to high-fidelity simulations in engineering and scientific applications.

This paper deals into the long-term behavior of subordinated critical branching processes with migration. We focus on scenarios where emigration is the dominant factor and introduce additional randomness in timing through a subordination mechanism, involving renewal processes. The key findings highlight how the initial population size and the interarrival mean time influence both asymptotic behavior of the non-extinction probability and corresponding Yaglom type limit theorems. We also study an alternating regenerative process, when the population cycles between zero and positive states. This research complements previous studies for processes when immigration prevails over emigration.

Can a small Gaussian perturbation break subadditivity?
Paolo Leonetti

Given an integer $a\ge 1$, a function $f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be $a$-subadditive if $$ f(ax+y) \le af(x)+f(y) \,\,\,\text{ for all }x,y \in \mathbb{R}. $$ Of course, $1$-subadditive functions (which correspond to ordinary subadditive functions) are $2$-subadditive. % and $3$-subadditive. Answering a question of Matkowski, we show that there exists a continuous function $f$ satisfying $f(0)=0$ which is $2$-subadditive but not $1$-subadditive. In addition, the same example is not $3$-subadditive, which shows that the sequence of families of continuous $a$-subadditive functions passing through the origin is not increasing with respect to $a$. The construction relies on a perturbation of a given subadditive function with an even Gaussian ring, which will destroy the original subadditivity while keeping the weaker property.
Lastly, given a positive rational cone $H\subseteq (0,\infty)$ which is not finitely generated, we prove that there exists a subadditive bijection $f:H\to H$ such that $\liminf_{x\to 0}f(x)=0$ and $\limsup_{x\to 0}f(x)=1$. This is related an open question of Matkowski and {Ś}wi{\k a}tkowski in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 119 (1993), 187--197].

We present sharp estimates for the extremal eigenvalues of the Schur complements arising in saddle point problems. These estimates are derived using the auxiliary space theory, in which a given iterative method is interpreted as an equivalent but more elementary iterative method on an auxiliary space, enabling us to obtain sharp convergence estimates. The proposed framework improves or refines several existing results, which can be recovered as corollaries of our results. To demonstrate the versatility of the framework, we present various applications from scientific computing: the augmented Lagrangian method, mixed finite element methods, and nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods. In all these applications, the condition numbers of the corresponding Schur complements can be estimated in a straightforward manner using the proposed framework.

This study considers a set of routes used by public transportation vehicles and dedicated distribution fleets in a general network. We aim to optimally locate alternative fuel refueling stations in the network to serve these dedicated routes. Deviations from prescribed routes for refueling purposes are allowed. Unlike most related literature, our approach considers all points in the network as candidate refueling station locations. We derive coverage constraints for any candidate location to serve a given route. Then we develop an exact algorithm to establish a finite dominating set (FDS) of candidate locations guaranteed to include an optimal solution to the problem. This set can be used in a mathematical model to minimize the number of stations required to cover all flows in the network. Numerical experiments on realistic networks are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and to demonstrate its scalability and sensitivity to changes in parameter values.

Micro-transit services offer a promising solution to enhance urban mobility and access, particularly by complementing existing public transit. However, effectively designing these services requires determining optimal service zones for these on-demand shuttles, a complex challenge often constrained by operating budgets and transit agency priorities. This paper presents a novel two-phase algorithmic framework for designing optimal micro-transit service zones based on the objective of maximizing served demand. A key innovation is our adaptation of the shareability graph concept from its traditional use in dynamic trip assignment to the distinct challenge of static spatial zoning. We redefine shareability by considering geographical proximity within a specified diameter constraint, rather than trip characteristics. In Phase 1, the framework employs a highly scalable algorithm to generate a comprehensive set of candidate zones. In Phase 2, it formulates the selection of a specified number of zones as a Weighted Maximum Coverage Problem, which can be efficiently solved by an integer programming solver. Evaluations on real-world data from Chattanooga, TN, and synthetic datasets show that our framework outperforms a baseline algorithm, serving 27.03% more demand in practice and up to 49.5% more demand in synthetic settings.

Cycle systems, coparking functions, and h-vectors of matroids

Combinatorics (math.CO)
The h-vector of a matroid M is an important invariant related to the independence complex of M and can also be recovered from an evaluation of its Tutte polynomial. A well-known conjecture of Stanley posits that the h-vector of a matroid is a pure O-sequence, meaning that it can be obtained by counting faces of a pure multicomplex. Merino has established Stanley's conjecture for the case of cographic matroids via chip-firing on graphs and the concept of a G-parking function. Inspired by these constructions, we introduce the notion of a cycle system for a matroid M -- a family of cycles (unions of circuits) of M with overlap properties that mimic cut-sets in a graph. A choice of cycle system on M defines a collection of integer sequences that we call coparking functions. We show that for any cycle system on M, the set of coparking functions is in bijection with the set of bases of M. We show that maximal coparking functions all have the same degree, and that cycle systems behave well under deletion and contraction. This leads to a proof of Stanley's conjecture for the case of matroids that admit cycle systems, which include, for instance, graphic matroids of cones as well as K33-free graphs.

Ryser's Theorem for Simple Multi-Latin Rectangle
Amin Bahmanian
Comments:
13 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We prove a general result on completing objects similar to Latin rectangles in which the number of occurrences of each symbol is prescribed, each cell contains multiple symbols, and no cell contains repeated symbols. This generalizes several results in the literature, and leads to confirming a conjecture of Cavenagh, Hämäläinen, Lefevre, and Stones.
An $r\times s$ {\it $\lambda$-Latin rectangle} $L$ is an $r\times s$ array in which each cell contains a multiset of $\lambda$ elements from the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$ of symbols such that each symbol occurs at most $\lambda$ times in each row and column. If $r=s=n$, then $L$ is a {\it $\lambda$-Latin square}. A $\lambda$-Latin rectangle is {\it simple} if no symbol is repeated in any cell. Cavenagh et al. asked for conditions that ensure a simple $\lambda$-Latin rectangle can be extended to a simple $\lambda$-Latin square. We solve this problem in a more general setting by allowing the number of occurrences of each symbol to be prescribed. Cavenagh et al. conjectured that for each $r, \lambda$ there exists some $n(r, \lambda)$ such that for any $n \geq n(r, \lambda)$, every simple partial $\lambda$-Latin square of order $r$ (each cell contain at most $\lambda$ symbols) embeds in a simple $\lambda$-Latin square of order $n$. We confirm this conjecture.

Uniqueness of tangent planes and (non-)removable singularities at infinity for collapsed translators
Eddygledson Souza Gama, Francisco Martín, Niels Martin Møller
Comments:
52 pages, 10 figures
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We show that mean curvature flow translators may exhibit non-removable singularities at infinity, due to jump discontinuities in their asymptotic profiles, and that oscillation can persist so as to yield a continuum of subsequential limit tangent planes. Nonetheless, we prove that as time $t\to\pm \infty$, any finite entropy, finite genus, embedded, collapsed translating soliton in $\mathbb{R}^3$ converges to a uniquely determined collection of planes.
This requires global analysis of quasilinear soliton equations with non-perturbative drifts, which we analyze via sharp non-standard elliptic decay estimates for the drift Laplacian, implying improvements on the Evans-Spruck and Ecker-Huisken estimates in the soliton setting, and exploiting a link from potential theory of the Yukawa equation to heat flows with $L^\infty$-data on non-compact slice curves of these solitons.
The structure theorem follows: such solitons decompose at infinity into standard regions asymptotic to planes or grim reaper cylinders. As one application, we classify collapsed translators of entropy two with empty limits as $t\to +\infty$.

Convergence of a Second-Order Projection Method to Leray-Hopf Solutions of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations
Franziska Weber
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We analyze a second-order projection method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on bounded Lipschitz domains. The scheme employs a Backward Differentiation Formula of order two (BDF2) for the time discretization, combined with conforming finite elements in space. Projection methods are widely used to enforce incompressibility, yet rigorous convergence results for possibly non-smooth solutions have so far been restricted to first-order schemes. We establish, for the first time, convergence (up to subsequence) of a second-order projection method to Leray-Hopf weak solutions under minimal assumptions on the data, namely $u_0 \in L^2_{\text{div}}(\Omega)$ and $f \in L^2(0,T;L^2_{\text{div}}(\Omega))$. Our analysis relies on two ingredients: A discrete energy inequality providing uniform $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ and $L^2(0,T;H^1_0(\Omega))$ bounds for suitable interpolants of the discrete velocities, and a compactness argument combining Simon's theorem with refined time-continuity estimates. These tools overcome the difficulty that only the projected velocity satisfies an approximate divergence-free condition, while the intermediate velocity is controlled in space. We conclude that a subsequence of the approximations converges to a Leray-Hopf weak solution. This result provides the first rigorous convergence proof for a higher-order projection method under no additional assumptions on the solution beyond those following from the standard a priori energy estimate.

Preconditioned subgradient method for composite optimization: overparameterization and fast convergence

Composite optimization problems involve minimizing the composition of a smooth map with a convex function. Such objectives arise in numerous data science and signal processing applications, including phase retrieval, blind deconvolution, and collaborative filtering. The subgradient method achieves local linear convergence when the composite loss is well-conditioned. However, if the smooth map is, in a certain sense, ill-conditioned or overparameterized, the subgradient method exhibits much slower sublinear convergence even when the convex function is well-conditioned. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Levenberg-Morrison-Marquardt subgradient method that converges linearly under mild regularity conditions at a rate determined solely by the convex function. Further, we demonstrate that these regularity conditions hold for several problems of practical interest, including square-variable formulations, matrix sensing, and tensor factorization. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of our method.

We give a sufficient condition for an $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a $3$-manifold to admit an immersion (or embedding) into $\mathbb{C}^3$ so that its complex tangencies define an Engel structure. In particular, every oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a closed, oriented $3$-manifold admits such an immersion. If the bundle is trivial, this immersion can be chosen to be an embedding and, moreover, infinitely many pairwise smoothly non-isotopic embeddings of this type can be constructed.
These are the first examples of compact submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$ whose complex tangencies are Engel, answering a question of Y. Eliashberg.

Subjects:

Jacobi permutations, introduced by Viennot in the context of Jacobi elliptic functions, are counted by the Euler numbers $E_{n}$ appearing in the series expansion $\sec x+\tan x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}E_{n}x^{n}/n!$. We conduct a systematic study of pattern avoidance in Jacobi permutations, achieving a complete enumeration of Jacobi permutations avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. In the case of a single pattern restriction, we obtain refined enumerations with respect to several permutation statistics: the number of ascents (or descents), the number of left-to-right minima, and the last letter. Bijections involving certain subfamilies of binary trees and Dyck paths, as well as generating function techniques, play important roles in our proofs.

Subjects:

For each finite Coxeter group $W$ and each standard Coxeter element of $W$, we construct a triangulation of the $W$-permutahedron. For particular realizations of the $W$-permutahedron, we show that this is a regular triangulation induced by a height function coming from the theory of total linear stability for Dynkin quivers. We also explore several notable combinatorial properties of these triangulations that relate the Bruhat order, the noncrossing partition lattice, and Cambrian congruences. Each triangulation gives an explicit mechanism for relating two different presentations of the corresponding braid group (the standard Artin presentation and Bessis's dual presentation). This is a step toward uniformly proving conjectural simple, explicit, and type-uniform presentations for the corresponding pure braid group.

A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree

Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two.
These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by Müller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.

Solvability of some integro-differential equations with the bi-Laplacian and transport

We demonstrate the existence in the sense of sequences of solutions for some integro-differential type problems involving the drift term and the square of the Laplace operator, on the whole real line or on a finite interval with periodic boundary conditions in the corresponding H^4 spaces. Our argument is based on the fixed point technique when the elliptic equations contain fourth order differential operators with and without the Fredholm property. It is established that, under the reasonable technical conditions, the convergence in L^1 of the integral kernels yields the existence and convergence in H^4 of the solutions.

Dynamic Factor Models with Forward-Looking Views
Anas Abdelhakmi, Andrew E.B. Lim
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Portfolio Management (q-fin.PM); Risk Management (q-fin.RM)
Prediction models calibrated using historical data may forecast poorly if the dynamics of the present and future differ from observations in the past. For this reason, predictions can be improved if information like forward looking views about the state of the system are used to refine the forecast. We develop an approach for combining a dynamic factor model for risky asset prices calibrated on historical data, and noisy expert views of future values of the factors/covariates in the model, and study the implications for dynamic portfolio choice. By exploiting the graphical structure linking factors, asset prices, and views, we derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of the factor and price processes after conditioning on the views. For linear factor models, the price process becomes a time-inhomogeneous affine process with a new covariate formed from the views. We establish a novel theoretical connection between the conditional factor process and a process we call a Mean-Reverting Bridge (MrB), an extension of the classical Brownian bridge. We derive the investor's optimal portfolio strategy and show that views influence both the myopic mean-variance term and the intertemporal hedge. The optimal dynamic portfolio when the long-run mean of the expected return is uncertain and learned online from data is also derived. More generally, our framework offers a generalizable approach for embedding forward-looking information about covariates in a dynamic factor model.

Q-Linear Convergence of the Proximal Augmented Lagrangian Method for Non-Convex Conic Programming
Ning Zhang, Yi Zhang
Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper provides a local convergence analysis of the proximal augmented Lagrangian method (PALM) applied to a class of non-convex conic programming problems. Previous convergence results for PALM typically imposed assumptions such as constraint non-degeneracy, strict complementarity, second-order sufficiency conditions, or a combination of constraint nondegeneracy with strong second-order sufficiency conditions. In contrast, our work demonstrates a Q-linear convergence rate for an inexact version of PALM in the context of non-convex conic programming, without requiring the uniqueness of the Lagrange multipliers. The analysis relies solely on the second-order sufficiency condition and the calmness property of the multiplier mapping, presenting a more relaxed set of conditions for ensuring convergence.

Positive Definiteness and Stability of Interval Tensors
Li Ye, Yisheng Song
Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we focus on the positive definiteness and Hurwitz stability of interval tensors. First, we introduce auxiliary tensors $\mathcal{A}^z$ and establish equivalent conditions for the positive (semi-)definiteness of interval tensors. That is, an interval tensor is positive definite if and only if all $\mathcal{A}^z$ are positive (semi-)definite. For Hurwitz stability, it is revealed that the stability of the symmetric interval tensor $\mathcal{A}_s^I$ can deduce the stability of the interval tensor $\mathcal{A}^I$, and the stability of symmetric interval tensors is equivalent to that of auxiliary tensors $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}^z$. Finally, taking $4$th order $3$-dimensional interval tensors as examples, the specific sufficient conditions are built for their positive (semi-)definiteness.

Neural solver for sixth-order ordinary differential equations
Janavi Bhalala, B. Veena S. N. Rao (Faculty Advsior)
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
A method for approximating sixth-order ordinary differential equations is proposed, which utilizes a deep learning feedforward artificial neural network, referred to as a neural solver. The efficacy of this unsupervised machine learning method is demonstrated through the solution of two distinct boundary value problems (BVPs), with the method being extended to include the solution of a sixth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). The proposed mean squared loss function is comprised of two terms: the differential equation is satisfied by the first term, while the initial or boundary conditions are satisfied by the second. The total loss function is minimized using a quasi-Newton optimization method to obtain the desired network output. The approximation capability of the proposed method is verified for sixth-order ODEs. Point-wise comparisons of the approximations show strong agreement with available exact solutions. The proposed algorithm minimizes the overall learnable network hyperparameters in a given BVP. Simple minimization of the total loss function yields highly accurate results even with a low number of epochs. Therefore, the proposed framework offers an attractive setting for the computational mathematics community.

Balancing Extensions in Posets of Large Width

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
We revisit classic balancing problems for linear extensions of a partially ordered set $P$, proving results that go far beyond many of the best earlier results on this topic. For example, with $p(x\prec y)$ the probability that $x$ precedes $y$ in a uniform linear extension, $\delta_{xy} = \min\{p(x \prec y), p(y \prec x)\}$, and $\delta(P)=\max \delta_{xy}$, we show that $\delta(P)$ tends to $1/2$ as $n := |P| \to\infty$ if $P$ has width $\Omega(n)$ or $\omega(\log(n))$ minimal elements, and is at least $1/e-o(1)$ if $P$ has width $\omega(\sqrt{n})$ or height $o(n)$.
Motivated by both consequences for balance problems and intrinsic interest, we also consider several old and new parameters associated with $P$. Here, in addition to balance, we study relations between the parameters and suggest various questions that are thought to be worthy of further investigation.

We consider the random Cauchy problem for the fully nonlocal telegraph equation of power type with the general $(\mathcal{PC}^{\ast})$ type kernel $(a,b)$. This equation can effectively characterize high-frequency signal transmission in small-scale systems. We establish a new completely positive kernel induced by $b$ (see Appendix \refeq{app b}) and derive two novel solution operators by using the relaxation functions associated with the new kernel,which are closely related to the operators $\cos(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ and $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{\beta}{4} }\sin(\theta(-\Delta)^{\frac{\beta}{4}} )$ for $\beta\in(1,2]$. These operators enable, for the first time, the derivation of mixed-norm $L_t^qL_x^{p'}$ estimates for the novel solution operators. Next, utilizing probabilistic randomization methods, we establish the average effects, the local existence and uniqueness for a large set of initial data $u^\omega \in L^{2}(\Omega, H^{s,p}(\mathbb R^3))$ ($p\in (1,2)$) while also obtaining probabilistic estimates for local existence under randomized initial conditions. The results reveal a critical phenomenon in the temporal regularity of the solution regarding the regularity index $s$ of the initial data $u^\omega$.

Learning Singularity-Encoded Green's Functions with Application to Iterative Methods
Qi Sun, Shengyan Li, Bowen Zheng, Lili Ju, Xuejun Xu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Green's function provides an inherent connection between theoretical analysis and numerical methods for elliptic partial differential equations, and general absence of its closed-form expression necessitates surrogate modeling to guide the design of effective solvers. Unfortunately, numerical computation of Green's function remains challenging due to its doubled dimensionality and intrinsic singularity. In this paper, we present a novel singularity-encoded learning approach to resolve these problems in an unsupervised fashion. Our method embeds the Green's function within a one-order higher-dimensional space by encoding its prior estimate as an augmented variable, followed by a neural network parametrization to manage the increased dimensionality. By projecting the trained neural network solution back onto the original domain, our deep surrogate model exploits its spectral bias to accelerate conventional iterative schemes, serving either as a preconditioner or as part of a hybrid solver. The effectiveness of our proposed method is empirically verified through numerical experiments with two and four dimensional Green's functions, achieving satisfactory resolution of singularities and acceleration of iterative solvers.

Dual Shellability of Admissible Set and Cohen-Macaulayness of Local Models

We prove Görtz's combinatorial conjecture \cite{Go01} on dual shellability of admissible sets in Iwahori-Weyl groups, proving that the augmented admissible set $\widehat{\mathrm{Adm}}(\mu)$ is dual shellable for any dominant coweight $\mu$. This provides a uniform, elementary approach to establishing Cohen-Macaulayness of the special fibers of the local models with Iwahori level structure for all reductive groups-including residue characteristic $2$ and non-reduced root systems-circumventing geometric methods. Local models, which encode singularities of Shimura varieties and moduli of shtukas, have seen extensive study since their introduction by Rapoport-Zink, with Cohen-Macaulayness remaining a central open problem. While previous work relied on case-specific geometric analyses (e.g., Frobenius splittings \cite{HR23} or compactifications \cite{He13}), our combinatorial proof yields an explicit labeling that constructs the special fiber by sequentially adding irreducible components while preserving Cohen-Macaulayness at each step, a new result even for split groups.

We then characterise varieties generated by kites and describe the lattice of these varieties as a complete sublattice of the lattice of perfectly generated varieties of perfect pseudo MV-algebras.

We investigate a semigroup construction generalising the two-sided wreath product. We develop the foundations of this construction and show that for groups it is isomorphic to the usual wreath product. We also show that it gives a slightly finer version of the decomposition in the Krohn-Rhodes Theorem, in which the three-element flip-flop monoid is replaced by the two-element semilattice.

Strong convergence rates of stochastic theta methods for index 1 stochastic differential algebraic equations under non-globally Lipschitz conditions
Lin Chen, Ziheng Chen, Jing Zhao
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This work investigates numerical approximations of index 1 stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with non-constant singular matrices under non-global Lipschitz conditions. Analyzing the strong convergence rates of numerical solutions in this setting is highly nontrivial, due to both the singularity of the constraint matrix and the superlinear growth of the coefficients. To address these challenges, we develop an approach for establishing mean square convergence rates of numerical methods for SDAEs under global monotonicity conditions. Specifically, we prove that each stochastic theta method with $\theta \in [\frac{1}{2},1]$ achieves a mean square convergence rate of order $\frac{1}{2}$. Theoretical findings are further validated through a series of numerical experiments.

We study splittings, or lack of them, in lattices of subvarieties of some logic-related varieties. We present a general lemma, the Non-Splitting Lemma, which when combined with some variety-specific constructions, yields each of our negative results: the variety of commutative integral residuated lattices contains no splittings algebras, and in the varieties of double Heyting algebras, dually pseudocomplemented Heyting algebras and regular double p-algebras the only splitting algebras are the two-element and three-element chains.

Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Non-Homogeneous Costs

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We study the Non-Homogeneous Sequential Hypothesis Testing (NHSHT), where a single active Decision-Maker (DM) selects actions with heterogeneous positive costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint \(\delta\), while minimizing expected total cost paid. Under standard arguments, we show that the objective decomposes into the product of the mean number of samples and the mean per-action cost induced by the policy. This leads to a key design principle: one should optimize the ratio of expectations (expected information gain per expected cost) rather than the expectation of per-step information-per-cost ("bit-per-buck"), which can be suboptimal. We adapt the Chernoff scheme to NHSHT, preserving its classical \(\log 1/\delta\) scaling. In simulations, the adapted scheme reduces mean cost by up to 50\% relative to the classic Chernoff policy and by up to 90\% relative to the naive bit-per-buck heuristic.

Task-Agnostic Learnable Weighted-Knowledge Base Scheme for Robust Semantic Communications

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)
With the emergence of diverse and massive data in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, the task-agnostic semantic communication system is regarded to provide robust intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic learnable weighted-knowledge base semantic communication (TALSC) framework for robust image transmission to address the real-world heterogeneous data bias in KB, including label flipping noise and class imbalance. The TALSC framework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the semantic coding networks as learners. The learners are updated based on the empirical knowledge provided by the learnable weighted-KB (LW-KB). Meanwhile, the meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task loss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the robustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between SCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid extension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) within SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables scalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining. Simulations demonstrate that the TALSC framework effectively mitigates the effects of flipping noise and class imbalance in task-agnostic image semantic communication, achieving at least 12% higher semantic recovery accuracy (SRA) and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We study the spectral properties of a stochastic process obtained by multiplicative inversion of a non-zero-mean Gaussian process. We show that its autocorrelation and power spectrum exist for most regular processes, and we find a convergent series expansion of the autocorrelation function in powers of the ratio between mean and standard deviation of the underlying Gaussian process. We apply the results to two sample processes, and we validate the theoretical results with simulations based on standard signal processing techniques.

In previous work, we derived new energy and entropy stable open boundary conditions and implementation procedures for linear and nonlinear initial boundary value problems. These boundary procedures results in estimates bounded by external data only. Interestingly, these new boundary conditions generalize the well known classical characteristic boundary conditions for linear problems to the nonlinear setting. We discuss the similarities and differences between these two boundary procedures and point out the advantages with the new procedures. In particular we show that the new boundary conditions bound both linear and nonlinear initial boundary value problems and can be implemented both strongly and weakly.

Poincar{é} series for analytic convex bodies

Subjects:

We study Poincar{é} series associated to strictly convex bodies in the Euclidean space. These series are Laplace transforms of the distribution of lengths (measured with the Finsler metric associated to one of the bodies) from one convex body to a lattice. Assuming that the convex bodies have analytic boundaries, we prove that the Poincar{é} series, originally defined in the right complex half-plane, continues holomorphically to a conical neighborhood of this set, removing a countable set of cuts and points. The latter correspond to the spectrum of a dual elliptic operator. We describe singularities of the Poincar{é} series at each of these branching points. One of the steps of the proof consists in showing analytic continuation of the resolvent of multiplication operators by a real-valued analytic Morse function on the sphere as a branched holomorphic function, a result of independent interest.

In this work, we propose and analyze DCA-PAGE, a novel algorithm that integrates the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA) with the ProbAbilistic Gradient Estimator (PAGE) to solve structured nonsmooth difference-of-convex programs. In the finite-sum setting, our method achieves a gradient computation complexity of $O(N + N^{1/2}\varepsilon^{-2})$ with sample size $N$, surpassing the previous best-known complexity of $O(N + N^{2/3}\varepsilon^{-2})$ for stochastic variance-reduced (SVR) DCA methods. Furthermore, DCA-PAGE readily extends to online settings with a similar optimal gradient computation complexity $O(b + b^{1/2}\varepsilon^{-2})$ with batch size $b$, a significant advantage over existing SVR DCA approaches that only work for the finite-sum setting. We further refine our analysis with a gap function, which enables us to obtain comparable convergence guarantees under milder assumptions.

Two-point Random Gradient-free Methods for Model-free Feedback Optimization

Comments:

Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Feedback optimization has emerged as a promising approach for optimizing the steady-state operation of dynamical systems while requiring minimal modeling efforts. Unfortunately, most existing feedback optimization methods rely on knowledge of the plant dynamics, which may be difficult to obtain or estimate in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel randomized two-point gradient-free feedback optimization method, inspired by zeroth-order optimization techniques. Our method relies on function evaluations at two points to estimate the gradient and update the control input in real-time. We provide convergence guarantees and show that our method is capable of computing an $\epsilon$-stationary point for smooth, nonconvex functions at a rate $\mathcal{O} (\epsilon^{-1})$, in line with existing results for two-point gradient-free methods for static optimization. Simulation results validate the findings.

Reflexive Partitions Induced by Rank Support and Non-Reflexive Partitions Induced by Rank Weight
Yang Xu, Haibin Kan, Guangyue Han
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper, we study partitions of finite modules induced by rank support and rank weight. First, we show that partitions induced by rank support are mutually dual with respect to suitable non-degenerate pairings, and hence are reflexive; moreover, we compute the associated generalized Krawtchouk matrices. Similar results are established for partitions induced by isomorphic relation of rank support. These results generalize counterpart results established for row space partitions and rank partitions of matrix spaces over finite fields. Next, we show that partitions of free modules over a finite chain ring $R$ induced by rank weight are non-reflexive provided that $R$ is not a field; moreover, we characterize the dual partitions explicitly. As a corollary, we show that rank partitions of matrix spaces over $R$ are reflexive if and only if $R$ is a field; moreover, two matrices belong to the same member of the dual partition if and only if their transposes are equivalent. In particular, we show that opposite to matrices over finite fields, rank metric does not induce an association scheme provided that $R$ is not a field, which further settles an open question proposed by Blanco-Chacón, Boix, Greferath and Hieta-Aho in \cite{2}.

Implicit Third-Order Peer Triplets with Variable Stepsizes for Gradient-Based Solutions in Large-Scale ODE-Constrained Optimal Control
Jens Lang, Bernhard A. Schmitt
Comments:
27 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper is concerned with the theory, construction and application of variable-stepsize implicit Peer two-step methods that are super-convergent for variable stepsizes, i.e., preserve their classical order achieved for uniform stepsizes when applied in a gradient-based solution algorithm to solve ODE-constrained optimal control problems in a first-discretize-then-optimize setting. Gradients of the objective function can be computed most efficiently using approximate adjoint variables. High accuracy with moderate computational effort can be achieved through time integration methods that satisfy a sufficiently large number of adjoint order conditions for variable stepsizes and provide gradients with higher-order consistency. In this paper, we enhance our previously developed variable implicit two-step Peer triplets constructed in [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 460, 2025] to get ready for large-scale dynamical systems with varying time scales without loosing efficiency. A key advantage of Peer methods is their use of multiple stages with the same high stage order, which prevents order reduction - an issue commonly encountered in semi discretized PDE problems with boundary control. Two third-order methods with four stages, good stability properties, small error constants, and a grid adaptation by equi-distributing global errors are constructed and tested for a 1D boundary heat control problem and an optimal control of cytotoxic therapies in the treatment of prostate cancer.

We perform a Lie symmetry analysis on the tempered-fractional Keller Segel (TFKS) system, a chemo- taxis model incorporating anomalous diffusion. A novel approach is used to handle the nonlocal nature of tempered fractional operators. By deriving the full set of Lie point symmetries and identifying the optimal one-dimensional subalgebras, we reduce the TFKS PDEs to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), yielding new exact solutions. These results offer insights into the long-term behavior and aggregation dynamics of the TFKS model and present a methodology applicable to other tempered fractional differential equations.

In recent works, the authors of this chapter have shown with co-authors how a basis consisting of dilated and shifted $\text{sinc}$-functions can be used to solve fractional partial differential equations. As a model problem, the fractional Dirichlet problem with homogeneous exterior value conditions was solved. In this work, we briefly recap the algorithms developed there and that -- from a computational point of view -- they can be used to solve nonlocal equations given through different operators as well. As an example, we numerically solve the Dirichlet problem for the logarithmic Laplacian $\log(-\Delta)$ which has the Fourier symbol $\log(\left|\omega\right|^2)$ and compute its Eigenvalues on disks with different radii in $\mathbb R^2$.

The atmospheric structure of gas giants, especially those of Jupiter and Saturn, has been an object of scientific studies for a long time. The measurement of the gravitational fields by the Juno mission for Jupiter and the Cassini mission for Saturn offered new possibilities to study the interior structure of these planets. Accordingly, the reconstruction of the wind velocities from gravitational data on gas giants has been the subject of many research papers over the years, yet the mathematical foundations of this inverse problem and its numerical resolution have not been studied in detail. This article suggests a rigorous mathematical theory for inferring the wind fields of gas giants. In particular, an orthonormal basis is derived which can be associated to models of the gravitational potential and the interior wind velocity field. Moreover, this approach provides the foundations for existing resolution concepts of the inverse problem.

We develop a rigorous measure-theoretic framework for the analysis of fixed points of nonexpansive maps in the space $L^1(\mu)$, with explicit consideration of quantization errors arising in fixed-point arithmetic. Our central result shows that every bounded, closed, convex subset of $L^1(\mu)$ that is compact in the topology of local convergence in measure (a property we refer to as measure-compactness) enjoys the fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings. The proof relies on techniques from uniform integrability, convexity in measure, and normal structure theory, including an application of Kirk's theorem. We further analyze the effect of quantization by modeling fixed-point arithmetic as a perturbation of a nonexpansive map, establishing the existence of approximate fixed points under measure-compactness conditions. We also present counterexamples that illustrate the optimality of our assumptions.
Beyond the theoretical development, we apply this framework to a human-in-the-loop co-editing system. By formulating the interaction between an AI-generated proposal, a human editor, and a quantizer as a composition of nonexpansive maps on a measure-compact set, we demonstrate the existence of a "stable consensus artefact". We prove that such a consensus state remains an approximate fixed point even under bounded quantization errors, and we provide a concrete example of a human-AI editing loop that fits this framework. Our results underscore the value of measure-theoretic compactness in the design and verification of reliable collaborative systems involving humans and artificial agents.

The rectangle condition does not detect the strong irreducibility

Geometric Topology (math.GT)
The rectangle condition for a genus $g$ Heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold, defined by Casson and Gordon, provides a sufficient criterion for the Heegaard splitting to be strongly irreducible. However it is unknown whether there exists a strongly irreducible Heegaard splitting which does not satisfy the rectangle condition. In this paper we provide a counterexample of a genus 2 Heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold which is strongly irreducible but fails to satisfy the rectangle condition. The way of constructing such an example is to take a double branched cover of a 3-bridge decomposition of a knot in $S^3$ which is strongly irreducible but does not meet the rectangle condition. This implies that the rectangle condition does not detect the strong irreducibility. As our next goal, we expect that this result provides the weaker version of the rectangle condition which detects the strong irreducibility.

Our results extend the asymptotic formulas proved in Fodor, Papvári and Vígh (2020) and Fodor and Montenegro (2024), and have consequences about $L$-convex floating bodies and relative affine surface area that were investigated by Schütt, Werner and Yalikun (2025).

Falconer's problem for dot product on paraboloids

We establish dimensional thresholds for dot product sets associated with compact subsets of translated paraboloids. Specifically, we prove that when the dimension of such a subset exceeds $ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{4} $ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and $ \frac{d}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8d - 4} $ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 4$, its dot product set has positive Lebesgue measure.
This result demonstrates that if a compact set in $ \mathbb{R}^d $ exhibits a paraboloidal structure, then the usual dimensional barrier of $ \frac{d}{2} $ for dot product sets can be lowered for $ d \geq 3 $. Our work serves as the continuous counterpart of a paper by Che-Jui Chang, Ali Mohammadi, Thang Pham, and Chun-Yen Shen, which examines the finite field setting with partial reliance on the extension conjecture.
The key idea, closely following their paper, is to reformulate the dot product set on the paraboloid as a variant of a distance set. This reformulation allows us to leverage state-of-the-art results from the pinned distance problem, as established by Larry Guth, Alex Iosevich, Yumeng Ou, and Hong Wang for $ d = 2 $, and by Xiumin Du, Yumeng Ou, Kevin Ren, and Ruixiang Zhang for higher dimensions. Finally, we present explicit constructions and existence proofs that highlight the sharpness of our results.

A note on Tricomi-type partial differential equations with white noise initial condition

Comments:
14 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study a class of Tricomi-type partial differential equations previously investigated in [28]. Firstly, we generalize the representation formula for the solution obtained there by allowing the coefficient in front of the second-order partial derivative with respect to $x$ to be any non integer power of $t$. Then, we analyze the robustness of that solution by taking the initial data to be Gaussian white noise and we discover that the existence of a well-defined random field solution is lost upon the introduction of lower-order terms in the operator. This phenomenon shows that, even though the Tricomi-type operators with or without lower-order terms are the same from the point of view of the theory of hyperbolic operators with double characteristics, their corresponding random versions exhibit different well posedness properties. We also prove that for more regular initial data, specifically fractional Gaussian white noise with Hurst parameter $H\in (1/2,1)$, the well posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Tricomi-type operator with lower-order term is restored.

The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.

Then, we give examples which show that we improve the number of errors we can correct in comparison with the known results for this family of codes. Finally, we deal, from a probabilistic point of view, with the problem of determining when the algorithm only needs to use a smaller PD-like set.

A subset $L$ of $V$ is said to be liar's vertex-edge dominating set if $(i)$ for every edge $e\in E$, $|N_G[e]\cap L|\geq 2$ and $(ii)$ for every pair of distinct edges $e,e'$, $|(N_G[e]\cup N_G[e'])\cap L|\geq 3$. The minimum liar's vertex-edge domination problem is to find the liar's vertex-edge dominating set of minimum cardinality. In this article, we show that the liar's vertex-edge domination problem is NP-complete in unit disk graphs, and we design a polynomial time approximation scheme(PTAS) for the minimum liar's vertex-edge domination problem in unit disk graphs.

Title:
A Poisson representation of the positive sojourn time of Lévy processes
Helmut H. Pitters
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study the distribution of the positive sojourn time $$ A_t:= \int_0^t \mathbf 1\{ X_s>0 \}ds $$ of an arbitrary Lévy process $X:= (X_t)_{t\geq 0}$. For an exponential random variable $E^{(q)}$ of rate $q>0$ independent of $X$ we show the representation in law \begin{align*}
A_{E^{(q)}} =_d \sum_{T\in \Pi} T \end{align*} as the sum of points of a Poisson process $\Pi$ with intensity given explicitely in terms of the positivity $t\mapsto \mathbb P\{X_t>0\}$. This representation raises some fundamental questions, not least because $\Pi$ turns out to be intimately connected to the celebrated Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. Moreover, we characterise $A_t$ by working out its double Laplace transform, and thus complement a recent result in which the distribution of $A_t$ was characterised via its higher moments. As a Corollary of the Poisson representation, in the special cases where $X$ is Brownian motion, a symmetric stable process, a Lévy process with constant positivity, we obtain an extension and new derivation of classical (generalised) arcsine laws going back to Lévy (1939), Kac (1951), and Getoor and Sharpe (1994), respectively. Even in these cases the Poisson representation is new.
As an application, if $X$ is the $(1/2)$-stable subordinator with drift, we obtain both the Laplace transform of $A_t$ and the density of its distribution. This is the second example of a Lévy process whose occupation time distribution is known explicitely but is not generalized arcsine, the first example being Brownian motion with drift that was studied earlier in the context of option prizing.

Quantum instruments are mathematical devices introduced to describe the conditional state change during a quantum process. They are completely positive map valued measures on measurable spaces. We may also view them as non-commutative analogues of joint probability measures. We analyze the $C^*$-convexity structure of spaces of quantum instruments. A complete description of the $C^*$-extreme instruments in finite dimensions has been established. Further, the implications of $C^*$-extremity between quantum instruments and their marginals has been explored.

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Let $S_{g,n}$ be a closed oriented hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 0$ with $n\geq 0$ marked points, with the understanding that $S_{g,0}=S_g$. Let $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{h,n})$ be the mapping class group of $S_{h,n}$ and $\mathrm{LMod}_p(S_{h,n})$ be the liftable mapping class group associated to a cover $p:S_g\to S_{h,n}$. For the cover $p_k:S_k\to S_{1,2}$, in his PhD thesis, Ghaswala~\cite{ghaswala_thesis} derived a finite presentation for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_{1,2})$ when $k=2,3,4$ and a finite generating set when $k=5,6$ using the Reidemeister-Schreier rewriting process. In this paper, we derive a finite generating set for $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_{1,2})$ for all $k\geq 2$. In the process, we also prove that the kernel of the homology representation $\Psi:\mathrm{Mod}(S_{1,2})\to \mathrm{GL}_3(\Z)$ is normally generated by a separating Dehn twist and is free with a countable basis. We also provide an explicit countable basis for $\ker\Psi$ consisting of separating Dehn twists. As an application of Birman-Hilden theory, we provide a finite generating set for the normalizer of the Deck group of $p_k$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_k)$ when $k=2,3$. We conclude the paper by proving that $\mathrm{LMod}_{p_k}(S_{1,2})$ is maximal in $\mathrm{Mod}(S_{1,2})$ if and only if $k$ is prime.

We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)
The class of the fine moduli space of stable $n$-pointed curves of genus zero, $\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}}$, in the Grothendieck ring of varieties encodes its Poincaré polynomial. Aluffi-Chen-Marcolli conjecture that the Grothendieck class of $\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}}$ is real-rooted (and hence ultra-log-concave), and they proved an asymptotic ultra-log-concavity result for these polynomials. We build upon their work, by providing effectively computable bounds for the error term in their asymptotic formula for $\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2l}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})$. As a consequence, we prove that in the range $l \le \frac{n}{10\log n}$, the ultra-log-concavity inequality \[\left(\frac{\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2(l-1)}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})}{\binom{n-3}{l-1}}\right)^2 \ge \frac{\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2(l-2)}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})\mathrm{rk}\, H^{2l}(\overline{\mathcal{M}_{0,n}})}{\binom{n-3}{l-2}\binom{n-3}{l}} \]

The paper considers computable Folner sequences in computably enumerable amenable groups. We extend some basic results of M.

The theory of rough stochastic differential equations (arXiv:2106.10340) is applied to revisit classical problems in stochastic filtering. We provide rough counterparts to the Kallianpur-Striebel formula and the Zakai and Kushner-Stratonovich equations, seen to coincide with classical objects upon randomization. We follow Crisan-Pardoux (arXiv:2411.11125) in doing so in a correlated diffusion setting. Well-posedness of the (rough) filtering equation is seen to hold under dimension-independent regularity assumption, in contrast to the stochastic case.

Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound

Comments:

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed Künneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.

The objective of this article is to prove the necessity statement in Crawley-Boevey's conjectural solution to the (tame) Deligne-Simpson problem. We use the nonabelian Hodge correspondence, variation of parabolic weights and results of Schedler-Tirelli to reduce to simpler situations, where every conjugacy class is semi-simple and the underlying quiver is (1) an affine Dynkin diagram or (2) an affine Dynkin diagram with an extra vertex. In case (1), a nonexistence result of Kostov applies. In case (2), the key step is to show that simple representations, if exist, lie in the same connected component as direct sums of lower dimensional ones.

The $l$-hypermaps, $l\ge2$, which generalize (dual of) ribbon graphs ($l=2$ case), are interesting enumerative objects. In this paper, based on a theorem of Carlet--van de Leur--Posthuma--Shadrin and the matrix-resolvent method, we derive an explicit formula for $k$-point generating series of enumeration of $l$-hypermaps, which generalizes the one obtained in [30] for the $l=2$ case.

Motivated by three recent open questions in the study of linear dynamics, we study weighted shifts on sequence spaces. First, we provide an~example of a~weighted shift on a~locally convex space whose topology is generated by a~sequence of complete seminorms which is generalized hyperbolic, but does not have the shadowing property. Next, we characterise uniform topological expansivity on Fréchet spaces satisfying some very natural conditions. Finally, we study the periodic shadowing property on normed spaces leading to a~condition formulated purely in terms of weights which we show is necessary for the periodic shadowing property on $\ell_p$ and equivalent on $c_0$.

All-$k$-Isolation in Trees
Geoffrey Boyer, Garrett C. Farrell, Wayne Goddard
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We define an all-$k$-isolating set of a graph to be a set $S$ of vertices such that, if one removes $S$ and all its neighbors, then no component in what remains has order $k$ or more. The case $k=1$ corresponds to a dominating set and the case $k=2$ corresponds to what Caro and Hansberg called an isolating set. We show that every tree of order $n \neq k$ contains an all-$k$-isolating set $S$ of size at most $n/(k+1)$, and moreover, the set $S$ can be chosen to be an independent set. This extends previous bounds on variations of isolation, while improving a result of Luttrell et al., who called the associated parameter the $k$-neighbor component order connectivity. We also characterize the trees where this bound is achieved. Further, we show that for~$k\le 5$, apart from one exception every tree with $n\neq k$ contains $k+1$ disjoint independent all-$k$-isolating sets.

Cohen-Macaulay Type via Lattice Homology and the Motivic Poincaré Series
Alex Hof, András Némethi
Subjects:

We give results on reduced complex-analytic curve germs which relate their indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay (MCM) modules to their lattice homology groups and related invariants, thereby providing a connection between the algebraic theory of MCM modules and techniques arising from low-dimensional topology. In particular, we characterize the germs $(C, o)$ of finite Cohen-Macaulay type in terms of the lattice homology $\mathbb{H}_*(C, o)$, and those of tame type in terms of the lattice homologies and associated spectral sequences of $(C, o)$ and its subcurves, including the distinction between germs of finite and infinite growth. As a consequence of these results, we obtain corresponding characterizations of a germ's Cohen-Macaulay type in terms of the motivic Poincaré series.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This note presents a novel, efficient economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. A new conception of convergence filters is defined to address the stability issue of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems. Three convergence filters are designed accordingly to be imposed into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon idea without terminal constraints is adopted to compromise the convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden of EMPC. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of the EMPC. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated by a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.

Wasserstein error estimates between telegraph processes and Brownian motion

We provide non-asymptotic error bounds in the path Wasserstein distance with quadratic integral cost between suitable functionals of the telegraph process and the corresponding functional of Brownian motion with explicit diffusivity constant. These results cover, in particular, the well-known example of the exponential integral functional of the geometric Brownian motion. The non-asymptotic error bounds tend to zero in the so-called Kac regime. Moreover, the error bounds remain valid when the flip rate for the telegraph process is small. We assess the sharpness of the error bounds through numerical experiments.

Frame redundancy and Beurling density
Marcin Bownik, Jordy Timo van Velthoven
Subjects:

We show that the frame measure function of a frame in certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on metric measure spaces is given by the reciprocal of the Beurling density of its index set. In addition, we show that each such frame with Beurling density greater than one contains a subframe with Beurling density arbitrary close to one. This confirms that the concept of frame measure function as introduced by Balan and Landau is a meaningful quantitative definition for the redundancy of a large class of infinite frames. In addition, it shows that the necessary density conditions for sampling in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces obtained by Führ, Gröchenig, Haimi, Klotz and Romero are optimal. As an application, we also settle the open questions of the existence of frames near the critical density for exponential frames on unbounded sets and for nonlocalized Gabor frames. The techniques used in this paper combine a selector form of Weaver's conjecture and various methods for quantifying the overcompleteness of frames.

We compare the notions of metric-compatibility and torsion of a connection in the frameworks of Beggs-Majid and Mesland-Rennie. It follows that for $\ast$-preserving connections, compatibility with a real metric in the sense of Beggs-Majid corresponds to Hermitian connections in the sense of Mesland-Rennie. If the calculus is quasi-tame, the torsion zero conditions are equivalent. A combination of these results proves the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connections in the sense of Mesland-Rennie for unitary cocycle deformations of a large class of Riemannian manifolds as well as the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi on all quantized irreducible flag manifolds.

An Inexact Tensor-Train Primal-Dual Interior-Point Method for Semidefinite Programs
Frederik Kelbel, Sergey Dolgov, Dante Kalise, Alessandra Russo
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this work, we introduce an interior-point method that employs tensor decompositions to efficiently represent and manipulate the variables and constraints of semidefinite programs, targeting problems where the solutions may not be low-rank but admit low-tensor-train rank approximations. Our method maintains approximate superlinear convergence despite inexact computations in the tensor format and leverages a primal-dual infeasible interior-point framework. In experiments on Maximum Cut, Maximum Stable Set, and Correlation Clustering, the tensor-train interior point method handles problems up to size $2^{12}$ with duality gaps around $10^{-6}$ in approximately 1.5~h and using less than 2~GB of memory, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers on larger instances. Moreover, numerical evidence indicates that tensor-train ranks of the iterates remain moderate along the interior-point trajectory, explaining the scalability of the approach. Tensor-train interior point methods offer a promising avenue for problems that lack traditional sparsity or low-rank structure, exploiting tensor-train structures instead.

Homology character of the parabolic coset poset
Theo Douvropoulos, Matthieu Josuat-Vergès
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Motivated by the analogy with the Coxeter complex on one side, and parking functions on the other side, we study the poset of parabolic cosets in a finite Coxeter group. We show that this poset is Cohen-Macaulay, and get an explicit formula for the character of its (unique) nonzero homology group in terms of the Möbius function of the intersection lattice. This homology character becomes a positive element of the parabolic Burnside ring (in its natural basis) after tensoring with the sign character. The coefficients of this character essentially encode the colored $h$-vector of the positive chamber complex (following Bastidas, Hohlweg, and Saliola, this complex is defined by taking Weyl chambers that lie on the positive side of a generic hyperplane). Roughly speaking, tensoring by the sign character on one side corresponds to the transformation going from the $f$-vector to the $h$-vector on the other side.

We study a system of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, depending on a small parameter $\eps$, that models long-range segregation of populations. The diffusion is governed by the negative Pucci operator. In the linear case, this system was previously investigated by Caffarelli, the second author, and Quitalo in \cite{CL2} as a model in population dynamics. We establish the existence of solutions and prove convergence as $\eps\to0^+$ to a free boundary problem in which populations remain segregated at a positive distance. In addition, we show that the supports of the limiting functions are sets of finite perimeter and satisfy a semi-convexity property.

A thermodynamically consistent model for bulk-surface viscous fluid mixtures: Model derivation and mathematical analysis
Patrik Knopf, Jonas Stange
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We derive and analyze a new diffuse interface model for incompressible, viscous fluid mixtures with bulk-surface interaction. Our system consists of a Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model in the bulk that is coupled to a surface Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model on the boundary. Compared with previous models, the inclusion of an additional surface Navier--Stokes equation is motivated, for example, by biological applications such as the seminal \textit{fluid mosaic model} (Singer \& Nicolson, \textit{Science}, 1972) in which the surface of biological cells is interpreted as a thin layer of viscous fluids. We derive our new model by means of local mass balance laws, local energy dissipation laws, and the Lagrange multiplier approach. Moreover, we prove the existence of global weak solutions via a semi-Galerkin discretization. The core part of the mathematical analysis is the study of a novel bulk-surface Stokes system and its corresponding bulk-surface Stokes operator. Its eigenfunctions are used as the Galerkin basis to discretize the bulk-surface Navier--Stokes subsystem.

By imposing an additional integrability condition on the first component of the solution, this paper establishes an existence and uniqueness result for $L^1$ solutions of multidimensional backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with a general terminal time when the generator $g$ satisfies a stochastic one-sided Osgood condition along with a general growth condition in the state variable $y$, and a stochastic Lipschitz condition in the state variable $z$, extending and strengthening Theorems 1 and 2 of Fan [J. Theor. Probab. 31(2018)]. Two general stochastic Gronwall-type and Bihari-type inequalities along with some innovative techniques dealing with stochastic coefficients and weaker integrability conditions play crucial roles in our proofs, and can be useful in further study on the adapted solution of BSDEs.

Entire Large Solutions for Competitive Semilinear Elliptic Systems with General Nonlinearities Satisfying Keller--Osserman Conditions

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We generalize a theorem of Lair concerning the existence of positive entire large solutions to competitive semilinear elliptic systems. While Lair's original result \cite{Lair2025} was established for power-type nonlinearities, our work extends the theory to a broad class of general nonlinearities satisfying a Keller--Osserman-type growth condition. The proof follows the same conceptual framework monotone iteration to construct global positive solutions, reduction to a scalar inequality for the sum of the components, application of a Keller--Osserman transform, and a two-step radial integration argument but replaces the explicit power-law growth with a general monotone envelope function. This approach yields a unified and verifiable criterion for the existence of large solutions in terms of the Keller--Osserman integral, thereby encompassing both critical and supercritical growth regimes within a single analytical setting.

On the Geometry of $φ$-Static Perfect Fluid Space-Times

Comments:
156 pages
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
In this paper we study the geometry of $\varphi$-static perfect fluid space-times ($\varphi$-SPFST, for short). In the context of Einstein's General Relativity, they arise from a space-time whose matter content is described by a perfect fluid in addition to a nonlinear field expressed by a smooth map $\varphi$ with values in a Riemannian manifold. Considering the Lorentzian manifold $\hat{M}$ in the form of a static warped product, we derive the fundamental equations via reduction of Einstein's Field Equations to the factors of the product. To set the stage for our main results, we discuss the validity of the classical Energy Conditions in the present setting and we introduce the formalism of $\varphi$-curvatures, which is a fundamental tool to merge the geometry of the manifold with that of the smooth map $\varphi$. We then present several mathematical settings in which similar structures arise. After computing two integrability conditions, we apply them to prove a number of rigidity results, both for manifolds with or without boundary. In each of the aforementioned results, the main assumption is given by the vanishing of some $\varphi$-curvature tensors and the conclusion is a local splitting of the metric into a warped product. Inspired by the classical Cosmic No Hair Conjecture of Boucher, Gibbons and Horowitz, we find sharp sufficient conditions on a compact $\varphi$-SPFST with boundary to be isometric to the standard hemisphere. We then describe the geometry of relatively compact domains in $M$ subject to an upper bound on the mean curvature of their boundaries. Finally, we study non-existence results for $\varphi$-SPFSTs, both via the existence of zeroes of the solutions of an appropriate ODE and with the aid of a suitable integral formula generalising in a precise sense the well-known Kazdan-Warner obstruction.

A Chebyshev--Ritz Spectral Framework for Nonlinear Vibration of CNT-Reinforced Composite Beams
Maryam Jalili, Samad Noeiaghdam
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This study develops a spectral Ritz formulation for the nonlinear free vibration analysis of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) beams. Boundary-adapted Chebyshev basis functions are constructed to exactly satisfy clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The governing equations incorporate von~Kármán geometric nonlinearity, while the effective material properties for both uniform and functionally graded (FG) CNT distributions are evaluated using a modified rule of mixtures. Discretization via the Chebyshev-Ritz approach produces a reduced-order model exhibiting exponential convergence; for basis sizes $N \geq 12$, the fundamental frequency error remains below $0.1\%$ relative to published benchmarks.
Computational results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains, with the spectral approach requiring significantly less time than high-fidelity finite element discretizations of comparable accuracy. Parametric studies reveal that the fundamental frequency increases with CNT volume fraction and is sensitive to the interfacial load-transfer efficiency parameter $\eta_E$. Selected FG patterns are shown to enhance stiffness relative to uniformly distributed CNTs.
Validation against established numerical benchmarks yields relative differences of only a few percent. The current limitation of the method is its reliance on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumption, which neglects transverse shear deformation and damping; addressing these effects is proposed for future work. All numerical data and scripts are provided as supplementary material to ensure reproducibility.

We study an inverse boundary value problem for the nonlinear wave equation in $2 + 1$ dimensions. The objective is to recover an unknown potential $q(x, t)$ from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map using real-valued waves. We propose a direct numerical reconstruction method for the Radon transform of $q$, which can then be inverted using standard X-ray tomography techniques to determine $q$. Our implementation introduces a spectral regularization procedure to stabilize the numerical differentiation step required in the reconstruction, improving robustness with respect to noise in the boundary data. We also give rigorous justification and stability estimates for the regularized spectral differentiation of noisy measurements. A direct pointwise reconstruction method for $q$ is also implemented for comparison. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recovering potentials from boundary measurements of nonlinear waves and illustrate the advantages of the Radon-based reconstruction.

This paper is focused on the development of the notions of canonical and canonoid transformations within the framework of Hamiltonian Mechanics on locally conformal symplectic manifolds. Both, time-independent and time-dependent dynamics are considered. Noether-like theorems relating one-parameter groups of transformations with canonical and noncanonical symmetries, are formulated, proved as well as illustrated with elementary examples.

Adaptive least-squares space-time finite element methods for convection-diffusion problems
Christian Köthe, Olaf Steinbach
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper we formulate and analyse adaptive (space-time) least-squares finite element methods for the solution of convection-diffusion equations. The convective derivative $\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla u$ is considered as part of the total time derivative $\frac{d}{dt}u = \partial_t u + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla u$, and therefore we can use a rather standard stability and error analysis for related space-time finite element methods. For stationary problems we restrict the ansatz space $H^1_0(\Omega)$ such that the convective derivative is considered as an element of the dual $H^{-1}(\Omega)$ of the test space $H^1_0(\Omega)$, which also allows unbounded velocities $\mathbf{v}$. While the discrete finite element schemes are always unique solvable, the numerical solutions may suffer from a bad approximation property of the finite element space when considering convection dominated problems, i.e., small diffusion coefficients. Instead of adding suitable stabilization terms, we aim to resolve the solutions by using adaptive (space-time) finite element methods. For this we introduce a least-squares approach where the discrete adjoint defines local a posteriori error indicators to drive an adaptive scheme. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical considerations.

Title:
A characterization of locally ordered ternary relations in terms of digraphs
Guillermo Gamboa Quintero, Martín Matamala, Juan Pablo Peña
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Logic (math.LO)
In 1917, Huntington and Kline, followed by Huntington in 1924, studied systems of axioms for ternary relations aiming to capture the concepts of linear order (called betwenness) and cycle order, respectively. Among many other properties, they proved there are several independent set of axioms defining either linear order or cycle order. In this work, we consider systems arising from the four common axioms of linear order and cycle order, together with a new axiom F, stating that if a tuple abc is in the relation, then either cba or bca is in the relation as well. Although, at first glace this allows for a much richer type of systems, we prove that these are either of linear order or cycle order type. Our main result is a complete characterization of the finite systems satisfying the set of axioms {B, C, D, F, 2}, where B, C, D and 2 are axioms presented by Huntington. Unlike what happens in the previous situation, with this modification we obtain a larger family of systems which we characterize in terms of digraphs.

Non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent
Marco Amelio
Comments:

Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
We construct here the first known examples of non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent in odd positive characteristic for every large enough prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. In fact, we show that there are countably many pairwise non-isomorphic countable non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of characteristic $p$ for each such $p$. Furthermore, we construct non-periodic non-split sharply 2-transitive groups (of these same characteristics) with centralizers of involutions of bounded exponent. As a consequence of these results, we answer two open questions about sharply 2-transitive and 2-transitive permutation groups. The constructions of groups as announced rely on iteratively applying (geometric) small cancellation methods in the presence of involutions. To that end, we develop a method to control some small cancellation parameters in the presence of even-order torsion.

Polymatroidal ideals and their asymptotic syzygies

Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $I$ be a polymatroidal ideal. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the homological shift ideals of powers of polymatroidal ideals. We prove that the first homological shift algebra $\text{HS}_1(\mathcal{R}(I))$ of $I$ is generated in degree one as a module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. We conjecture that the $i$th homological shift algebra $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))$ of $I$ is generated in degrees $\le i$, and we confirm it in many significant cases. We show that $I$ has the $1$st homological strong persistence property, and we conjecture that the sequence $\{\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^k)\}_{k>0}$ of associated primes of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ becomes an increasing chain for $k\ge i$. This conjecture is established when $i=1$ and for many families of polymatroidal ideals. Finally, we explore componentwise polymatroidal ideals, and we prove that $\text{HS}_1(I)$ is again componentwise polymatroidal, if $I$ is componentwise polymatroidal.

RJD-BASE: Multi-Modal Spectral Clustering via Randomized Joint Diagonalization
Haoze He, Artemis Pados, Daniel Kressner
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
We revisit the problem of spectral clustering in multimodal settings, where each data modality is encoded as a graph Laplacian. While classical approaches--including joint diagonalization, spectral co-regularization, and multiview clustering--attempt to align embeddings across modalities, they often rely on costly iterative refinement and may fail to directly target the spectral subspace relevant for clustering. In this work, we introduce two key innovations. First, we bring the power of randomization to this setting by sampling random convex combinations of Laplacians as a simple and scalable alternative to explicit eigenspace alignment. Second, we propose a principled selection rule based on Bottom-$k$ Aggregated Spectral Energy (BASE)--a $k$-dimensional extension of the directional smoothness objective from recent minimax formulations--which we uniquely apply as a selection mechanism rather than an optimization target. The result is Randomized Joint Diagonalization with BASE Selection (RJD-BASE), a method that is easily implementable, computationally efficient, aligned with the clustering objective, and grounded in decades of progress in standard eigensolvers. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that RJD-BASE reliably selects high-quality embeddings, outperforming classical multimodal clustering methods at low computational cost.

Fractional-Order Nesterov Dynamics for Convex Optimization
Tumelo Ranoto
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We propose and analyze a class of second-order dynamical systems for continuous-time optimization that incorporate fractional-order gradient terms. The system is given by \begin{equation} \ddot{x}(t) + \frac{\alpha}{t}\dot{x}(t) + \nabla^{\theta} f(x(t)) = 0, \end{equation} where $\theta \in (1,2)$, and the fractional operators are interpreted in the sense of Caputo, Riemann--Liouville, and Grünwald--Letnikov derivatives. This formulation interpolates between memory effects of fractional dynamics and higher-order damping mechanisms, thereby extending the classical Nesterov accelerated flow into the fractional domain. A particular focus of our analysis is the regime $\alpha \leq 3$, and especially the critical case $\alpha = 3$, where the ordinary Nesterov flow fails to guarantee convergence. We show that in the fractional setting, convergence can still be established, with fractional gradient terms providing a stabilizing effect that compensates for the borderline damping. This highlights the ability of fractional dynamics to overcome fundamental limitations of classical second-order flows. We develop a convergence analysis framework for such systems by introducing fractional Opial-type lemmas and Lyapunov memory functionals. In the convex case, we establish weak convergence of trajectories toward the minimizer, as well as asymptotic decay of functional values. For strongly convex functions, we obtain explicit convergence rates that improve upon those of standard second-order flows

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Group Theory (math.GR)
In 2006, Collins and Trenk obtained a general sharp upper bound for the distinguishing chromatic number of a connected graph. Inspired by Catlin's combinatorial techniques from 1978, we establish improved upper bounds for classes of connected graphs that have only small complete bigraphs as induced subgraphs. In this framework, we also consider the list-distinguishing chromatic number of such graphs.
We apply Menger's theorem to demonstrate applications of our main result for graphs whose constructions are based on Paley graphs, Cayley graphs on Dihedral groups, and circulant Cayley graphs.

SSNCVX: A primal-dual semismooth Newton method for convex composite optimization problem
Zhanwang Deng, Tao Wei, Jirui Ma, Zaiwen Wen
Comments:
29 pages
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we propose a uniform semismooth Newton-based algorithmic framework called SSNCVX for solving a broad class of convex composite optimization problems.
By exploiting the augmented Lagrangian duality, we reformulate the original problem into a saddle point problem and characterize the optimality conditions via a semismooth system of nonlinear equations. The nonsmooth structure is handled internally without requiring problem specific transformation or introducing auxiliary variables. This design allows easy modifications to the model structure, such as adding linear, quadratic, or shift terms through simple interface-level updates. The proposed method features a single loop structure that simultaneously updates the primal and dual variables via a semismooth Newton step. Extensive numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that SSNCVX outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in both robustness and efficiency across a wide range of problems.

Let $R$ be a finite ring with identity. The clean graph $Cl(R)$ of a ring $R$ is a graph whose vertices are pairs $(e, u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of $R$. Two distinct vertices $(e, u)$ and $(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe = 0$ or $uv = vu = 1$. The graph $Cl_2(R)$ is the induced subgraph of $Cl(R)$ induced by the set $\{(e, u): e \text{ is a nonzero idempotent and } u \text{ is a unit of } R\}$. In this study, we present properties that arise from the isomorphism of two clean graphs and conditions under which two clean graphs over direct product rings are isomorphic. We also examine the structure of the clean graph over the ring $M_2(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ through their $Cl_2$ graph.

A Two-fold Randomization Framework for Impulse Control Problems
Haoyang Cao, Yuchao Dong, Zhouhao Yang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose and analyze a randomization scheme for a general class of impulse control problems. The solution to this randomized problem is characterized as the fixed point of a compound operator which consists of a regularized nonlocal operator and a regularized stopping operator. This approach allows us to derive a semi-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Through an equivalent randomization scheme with a Poisson compound measure, we establish a verification theorem that implies the uniqueness of the solution. Via an iterative approach, we prove the existence of the solution. The existence--and--uniqueness result ensures the randomized problem is well-defined. We then demonstrate that our randomized impulse control problem converges to its classical counterpart as the randomization parameter $\bf \lambda$ vanishes. This convergence, combined with the value function's $C^{2,\alpha}_{loc}$ regularity, confirms our framework provides a robust approximation and a foundation for developing learning algorithms. Under this framework, we propose an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Its policy improvement step is naturally derived from the iterative approach from the existence proof, which enjoys a geometric convergence rate. We implement a model-free version of the algorithm and numerically demonstrate its effectiveness using a widely-studied example. The results show that our RL algorithm can learn the randomized solution, which accurately approximates its classical counterpart. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the volatility parameter $\sigma$ in the state process effectively demonstrates the exploration--exploitation tradeoff.

In this paper, we examine the problem of sampling from log-concave distributions with (possibly) superlinear gradient growth under kinetic (underdamped) Langevin algorithms. Using a carefully tailored taming scheme, we propose two novel discretizations of the kinetic Langevin SDE, and we show that they are both contractive and satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Building on this, we establish a series of non-asymptotic bounds in $2$-Wasserstein distance between the law reached by each algorithm and the underlying target measure.

Optimal Solutions to Deflect Earth Crossing Objects Using Laser
Vivek Verma, Shribharath B., Mangal Kothari
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper solves and analyzes a trajectory optimization problem to deflect Earth-crossing objects (ECOs) employing continuous thrust obtained using a laser ablative system. The optimal control is determined for various initial ECO-Earth configurations to achieve the desired miss distance. The formulation incorporates the gravitational effect on the object due to the Earth using the patched-conic method. The constrained trajectory optimization problem is solved using Non-Linear Programming (NLP). First, the continuous control problem is solved, assuming both constant and variable power consumption, followed by a detailed comparison between the continuous control schemes. Subsequently, the work extends to studying sub-optimal solutions that can accommodate power fluctuations in the controller. The optimal control offers a range of alternative operational methods for asteroid deflection missions with trade-offs in power consumption and the total mission time. For impulsive deflection, the existing work reports two optimal solutions. One of the solutions is found to be better as it leads to a final ECO orbit that has its next Earth passage later than the other solution. Finally, the Moon's gravitational effect on the orbit of an ECO is studied. The reported results provide a comprehensive understanding of various scenarios in the process of ECO deflection.

Energy Efficiency Maximization for Movable Antenna-Enhanced MIMO Downlink System Based on S-CSI

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper presents an innovative movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink system. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) under statistical channel state information (S-CSI) through a joint optimization of the precoding matrix and the antenna position vectors (APVs). To solve the resulting stochastic problem, we first resort to deterministic equivalent (DE) tecnology to formulate the deterministic minorizing function of the system EE and the deterministic function of each user terminal (UT)'s average achievable rate w.r.t. the transmit variables (i.e., the precoding matrix and the transmit APV) and the corresponding receive APV, respectively. Then, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit variables and the receive APVs to maximize the formulated deterministic objective functions, respectively. Finally, the above AO algorithm is tailored for the single-user scenario. Our numerical results reveal that, the proposed MA-enhanced system can significantly improve the system EE compared to several benchmark schemes based on the S-CSI and the optimal performance can be achieved with a finite size of movement regions for MAs.

where the kernel $W$ is derived from the Volterra potential $V(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}-\frac12\log(x^2+y^2)$. We prove that the minimum energy is given by $- N \log{N} +\mathcal{O}(N)$.

Then we relate Hausdorff dimension of a set $E\subset G$ to the value of $s$-energy of the mass distribution $\mu$ on this set $E$. Namely we prove that if on a set $E$ there exists a mass distribution $\mu$ with finite $s$-energy, then the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is at least $s$.
The same condiion can be expressed also in terms of Fourier coefficients of $\mu$ with respect to Walsh system on the group $G$.

On the universal calibration of Pareto-type linear combination tests

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Probability (math.PR); Applications (stat.AP); Methodology (stat.ME)
It is often of interest to test a global null hypothesis using multiple, possibly dependent, $p$-values by combining their strengths while controlling the Type I error. Recently, several heavy-tailed combinations tests, such as the harmonic mean test and the Cauchy combination test, have been proposed: they map $p$-values into heavy-tailed random variables before combining them in some fashion into a single test statistic. The resulting tests, which are calibrated under the assumption of independence of the $p$-values, have shown to be rather robust to dependence. The complete understanding of the calibration properties of the resulting combination tests of dependent and possibly tail-dependent $p$-values has remained an important open problem in the area. In this work, we show that the powerful framework of multivariate regular variation (MRV) offers a nearly complete solution to this problem.
We first show that the precise asymptotic calibration properties of a large class of homogeneous combination tests can be expressed in terms of the angular measure -- a characteristic of the asymptotic tail-dependence under MRV. Consequently, we show that under MRV, the Pareto-type linear combination tests, which are equivalent to the harmonic mean test, are universally calibrated regardless of the tail-dependence structure of the underlying $p$-values. In contrast, the popular Cauchy combination test is shown to be universally honest but often conservative; the Tippet combination test, while being honest, is calibrated if and only if the underlying $p$-values are tail-independent.
One of our major findings is that the Pareto-type linear combination tests are the only universally calibrated ones among the large family of possibly non-linear homogeneous heavy-tailed combination tests.

Discrete weakly stable distributions
Matthew Aldridge
Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
A random variable X is strictly stable if a sum of independent copies of X has the same distribution as X up to scaling, and is stable (or weakly stable) if the sum has the same distribution as X up to both scaling and shifting. Steutel and Van Harn studied 'discrete strict stability' for random variables taking values in the non-negative integers, replacing scaling by the thinning operation. We extend this to 'discrete (weak) stability', where shifting is replaced by the addition of an independent Poisson random variable. The discrete stable distributions are 'Poisson-delayed Sibuya' distributions, which include the Poisson and Hermite distributions. Very similar results have been proved independently by Townes (arXiv:2509.05497).

Ramanujan proved three famous congruences for the partition function modulo 5, 7, and 11. The first author and Boylan proved that these congruences are the only ones of this type. In 1984 Andrews introduced the $m$-colored Frobenius partition functions $c\phi_m$; these are natural higher-level analogues of the partition function which have attracted a great deal of attention in the ensuing decades. For each $m\in \{5, 7, 11\}$ there are two analogues of Ramanujan's congruences for $c\phi_m$, and for these $m$ we prove there are no congruences like Ramanujan's other than these six. Our methods involve a blend of theory and computation with modular forms.

On the number of triangles in $K_4$-free graphs

Erdős asked whether for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, the parameter $p^*(G)=\min \sum_{i\ge 1} (|V(G_i)|-1)$ is at most $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor$, where the minimum is taken over all edge decompositions of $G$ into edge-disjoint cliques $G_i$. In a restricted case (also conjectured independently by Erdős), Győri and Keszegh [Combinatorica, 37(6) (2017), 1113--1124] proved that $p^*(G)\leq \lfloor n^2/4\rfloor$ for all $K_4$-free graphs $G$. Motivated by their proof approach, they conjectured that for any $n$-vertex $K_4$-free graph $G$ with $e$ edges, and any greedy partition $P$ of $G$ of size $r$, the number of triangles in $G$ is at least $r(e-r(n-r))$. If true, this would imply a stronger bound on $p^*(G)$. In this paper, we disprove their conjecture by constructing infinitely many counterexamples with arbitrarily large gap. We further establish a corrected tight lower bound on the number of triangles in such graphs, which would recover the conjectured bound once some small counterexamples we identify are excluded.

Secure Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels: Rate-Distortion-Equivocation Tradeoff
Denis Kozlov, Mahtab Mirmohseni, Rahim Tafazolli
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper investigates an information-theoretic model of secure semantic-aware communication. For this purpose, we consider the lossy joint source-channel coding (JSCC) of a memoryless semantic source transmitted over a memoryless wiretap channel. The source consists of two correlated parts that represent semantic and observed aspects of the information. Our model assumes separate fidelity and secrecy constraints on each source component and, in addition, encompasses two cases for the source output, in order to evaluate the performance gains if the encoder has an extended access to the source. Specifically, in Case 1, the encoder has direct access only to the samples from a single (observed) source component, while in Case 2 it has additional direct access to the samples of the underlaying semantic information. We derive single-letter converse and achievability bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region. The converse bound explicitly contains rate-distortion functions, making it easy to evaluate, especially for some common distributions. The proposed achievability coding scheme involves novel stochastic superposition coding with two private parts to enable analysis of the equivocation for each source component, separately. Our results generalise some of the previously established source and source-channel coding problems. The general results are further specialised to Gaussian and Bernoulli sources transmitted over Gaussian and binary wiretap channels, respectively. The numerical evaluations illustrate the derived bounds for these distributions.

Convergence rates for the vanishing viscosity approximation of fully nonlinear, non-convex, second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations
Alekos Cecchin, Alessandro Goffi
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We obtain new quantitative estimates of the vanishing viscosity approximation for time-dependent, degenerate, Hamilton-Jacobi equations that are neither concave nor convex in the gradient and Hessian entries of the form $\partial_t u+H(x,t,Du,D^2u)=0$ in the whole space. We approximate the PDE with a fully nonlinear, possibly degenerate, elliptic operator $\varepsilon F(x,t,D^2u)$. Assuming that $u\in C^\alpha_x$, $u_0\in C^\eta$, $H\in C^\beta_x$ and having power growth $\gamma$ in the gradient entry, we establish a convergence rate of order $\varepsilon^{\min\left\{\frac{\eta}{2},\frac{\beta+\gamma(\alpha-1)}{\beta+\gamma(\alpha-1)+2-\alpha}\right\}}$. Our novel approach exploits the regularizing properties of sup/inf-convolutions for viscosity solutions and the comparison principle. We also obtain explicit constants and do not assume differentiability properties neither on solutions nor on $H$. The same method provides new convergence rates for the vanishing viscosity approximation of the stationary counterpart of the equation and for transport equations with Hölder coefficients.

Fundamental Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms of higher degrees and levels
Pramath Anamby, Soumya Das

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We prove the following statement about any Siegel modular form $F$ of degree $n$ and arbitrary odd level $N$ on the group $\Gamma_1^{(n)}(N)$. Let $A(F,T)$ denote the Fourier coefficients of $F$ and write $T=(T(i,j))$.
Suppose that $F$ has a non-zero Fourier coefficient $A(F,T_0)$ such that $(T_0(n,n),N)=1$. Then there exist infinitely many odd and square-free (and thus fundamental) integers $m$ such that $m=\mathrm{discriminant}(T)$ and $A(F,T)\neq 0$. In the case of odd degrees, we prove a stronger result by replacing odd and square-free with odd and prime. We also prove quantitative results towards this.
As a consequence, we can show in particular that the statement of the main result in arXiv:2408.03442 about the algebraicity of certain critical values of the spinor $L$-functions of holomorphic newforms (in the ambit of Deligne's conjectures) on congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{GSp}(3)$ is unconditional.

On the First Non-Universal Term in Random Polynomial Real Zeros

Probability (math.PR)
Let $P_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \xi_k x^k$ be a Kac random polynomial, where the coefficients $\xi_k$ are i.i.d.\ copies of a given random variable $\xi$. Based on numerical experiments, it has been conjectured that if $\xi$ has mean zero, unit variance, and a finite $(2+\varepsilon_0)$-moment for some $\varepsilon_0>0$, then
\[
\mathbb{E}[N_{\mathbb{R}}(P_n)] \;=\; \frac{2}{\pi} \log n + C_{\xi} + o_n(1),
\] where $N_{\mathbb{R}}(P_n)$ denotes the number of real roots of $P_n$, and $C_{\xi}$ is an absolute constant depending only on $\xi$, which is nonuniversal. Prior to this work, the existence of $C_{\xi}$ had only been established by Do-Nguyen-Vu (2015, \emph{Proc.\ Lond.\ Math.\ Soc.}) under the additional assumption that $\xi$ either admits a $(1+p)$-integrable density or is uniformly distributed on $\{\pm 1, \pm 2, \dots, \pm N\}$. In this paper, using a different method, we remove these extra conditions on $\xi$, and extend the result to the setting where the $\xi_k$ are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. Moreover, this proof strategy provides an alternative description of the constant $C_{\xi}$, and this new perspective serves as the key ingredient in establishing that $C_{\xi}$ depends continuously on the distribution of $\xi$.

A Converse Control Lyapunov Theorem for Joint Safety and Stability
Thanin Quartz, Maxwell Fitzsimmons, Jun Liu
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We show that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions is equivalent to the existence of a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. This characterization complements existing literature on converse Lyapunov functions by establishing a partial differential equation (PDE) characterization with prescribed boundary conditions on the safe set, ensuring that the safe set is exactly certified by this Lyapunov function. The result also implies that if a safety and stability specification cannot be certified by a single Lyapunov function, then any pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions necessarily leads to a conflict and cannot be satisfied simultaneously in a robust sense.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents data-driven approaches for integrated assortment planning and inventory allocation that significantly improve fulfillment efficiency at this http URL, a leading E-commerce company. this http URL uses a two-level distribution network that includes regional distribution centers (RDCs) and front distribution centers (FDCs). Selecting products to stock at FDCs and then optimizing daily inventory allocation from RDCs to FDCs is critical to improving fulfillment efficiency, which is crucial for enhancing customer experiences. For assortment planning, we propose efficient algorithms to maximize the number of orders that can be fulfilled by FDCs (local fulfillment). For inventory allocation, we develop a novel end-to-end algorithm that integrates forecasting, optimization, and simulation to minimize lost sales and inventory transfer costs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches, increasing local order fulfillment rates by 0.54% and our inventory allocation algorithm increases FDC demand satisfaction rates by 1.05%. Considering the high-volume operations of this http URL, with millions of weekly orders per region, these improvements yield substantial benefits beyond the company's established supply chain system. Implementation across this http URL's network has reduced costs, improved stock availability, and increased local order fulfillment rates for millions of orders annually.

Dynamic Decision Modeling for Viable Short and Long Term Production Policies: An HJB Approach
Achraf Bouhmady, Mustapha Serhani, Nadia Raissi
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This study introduces a mathematical framework to investigate the viability and reachability of production systems under constraints. We develop a model that incorporates key decision variables, such as pricing policy, quality investment, and advertising, to analyze short-term tactical decisions and long-term strategic outcomes. In the short term, we constructed a capture basin that defined the initial conditions under which production viability constraints were satisfied within the target zone. In the long term, we explore the dynamics of product quality and market demand to achieve and sustain the desired target. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) theory characterizes the capture basin and viability kernel using viscosity solutions of the HJB equation. This approach, which avoids controllability assumptions, is well suited to viability problems with specified targets. It provides managers with insights into maintaining production and inventory levels within viable ranges while considering product quality and evolving market demand. We numerically studied the HJB equation to design and test computational methods that validate the theoretical insights. Simulations offer practical tools for decision-makers to address operational challenges while aligning with the long-term sustainability goals. This study enhances the production system performance and resilience by linking rigorous mathematics with actionable solutions.

Designing MacPherson Suspension Architectures using Bayesian Optimization

Engineering design is traditionally performed by hand: an expert makes design proposals based on past experience, and these proposals are then tested for compliance with certain target specifications. Testing for compliance is performed first by computer simulation using what is called a discipline model. Such a model can be implemented by a finite element analysis, multibody systems approach, etc. Designs passing this simulation are then considered for physical prototyping. The overall process may take months, and is a significant cost in practice. We have developed a Bayesian optimization system for partially automating this process by directly optimizing compliance with the target specification with respect to the design parameters. The proposed method is a general framework for computing a generalized inverse of a high-dimensional non-linear function that does not require e.g. gradient information, which is often unavailable from discipline models. We furthermore develop a two-tier convergence criterion based on (i) convergence to a solution optimally satisfying all specified design criteria, or (ii) convergence to a minimum-norm solution. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a vehicle chassis design problem motivated by an industry setting using a state-of-the-art commercial discipline model. We show that the proposed approach is general, scalable, and efficient, and that the novel convergence criteria can be implemented straightforwardly based on existing concepts and subroutines in popular Bayesian optimization software packages.

We obtain the four-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution in heterotic supergravity, which includes the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger solution as a limiting case. In particular, we first embed the Kerr solution into heterotic supergravity and compute the higher-derivative corrections. We then obtain the corrections to the Kerr-Sen solution by performing an $O(2,1)$ boost of the Kerr solution, which, in contrast to the two-derivative case, requires field redefinitions to make the $O(2,1)$ invariance of the action manifest. Finally, we compute the multipole moments and find that they are distinct from those of the Kerr solution at the four-derivative level. We also find that the multipole moments are distinct from those of the Kerr-Newman solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory at the four-derivative level, even for the most general choice of four-derivative corrections. This gives a way to experimentally distinguish traces of string theory in gravitational wave data.

This paper presents an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduling framework for licensed and unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. SL must share licensed spectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi, posing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or threshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives queueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its policy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our framework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based scheduling under limited licensed bandwidth. These findings demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI to enable stable, QoS-aware, and adaptive scheduling for future NR SL systems.

In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.

Cost-Free Personalization via Information-Geometric Projection in Bayesian Federated Learning

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)
Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization. Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and local performance with minimal computational overhead.

Distributed Gossip-GAN for Low-overhead CSI Feedback Training in FDD mMIMO-OFDM Systems

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Theory (cs.IT)
The deep autoencoder (DAE) framework has turned out to be efficient in reducing the channel state information (CSI) feedback overhead in massive multiple-input multipleoutput (mMIMO) systems. However, these DAE approaches presented in prior works rely heavily on large-scale data collected through the base station (BS) for model training, thus rendering excessive bandwidth usage and data privacy issues, particularly for mMIMO systems. When considering users' mobility and encountering new channel environments, the existing CSI feedback models may often need to be retrained. Returning back to previous environments, however, will make these models perform poorly and face the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To solve the above challenging problems, we propose a novel gossiping generative adversarial network (Gossip-GAN)-aided CSI feedback training framework. Notably, Gossip-GAN enables the CSI feedback training with low-overhead while preserving users' privacy. Specially, each user collects a small amount of data to train a GAN model. Meanwhile, a fully distributed gossip-learning strategy is exploited to avoid model overfitting, and to accelerate the model training as well. Simulation results demonstrate that Gossip-GAN can i) achieve a similar CSI feedback accuracy as centralized training with real-world datasets, ii) address catastrophic forgetting challenges in mobile scenarios, and iii) greatly reduce the uplink bandwidth usage. Besides, our results show that the proposed approach possesses an inherent robustness.

Choice Paralysis in Evolutionary Games

Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
In this paper, we consider finite-strategy approximations of infinite-strategy evolutionary games. We prove that such approximations converge to the true dynamics over finite-time intervals, under mild regularity conditions which are satisfied by classical examples, e.g., the replicator dynamics. We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary games: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is shown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of finite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true infinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how choice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting "stuck," even though every finite approximation converges to equilibrium.

The Multimarginal Schrödinger Bridge (MSB) finds the optimal coupling among a collection of random vectors with known statistics and a known correlation structure. In the MSB formulation, this correlation structure is specified \emph{a priori} as an undirected connected graph with measure-valued vertices. In this work, we formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimal MSB in the sense we seek the optimal coupling over all possible graph structures. We find that computing the optimal MSB amounts to solving the minimum spanning tree problem over measure-valued vertices. We show that the resulting problem can be solved in two steps. The first step constructs a complete graph with edge weight equal to a sum of the optimal value of the corresponding bimarginal SB and the entropies of the endpoints. The second step solves a standard minimum spanning tree problem over that complete weighted graph. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed solution.

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
This work proposes a bid shading strategy for first-price auctions as a measure-valued optimization problem. We consider a standard parametric form for bid shading and formulate the problem as convex optimization over the joint distribution of shading parameters. After each auction, the shading parameter distribution is adapted via a regularized Wasserstein-proximal update with a data-driven energy functional. This energy functional is conditional on the context, i.e., on publisher/user attributes such as domain, ad slot type, device, or location. The proposed algorithm encourages the bid distribution to place more weight on values with higher expected surplus, i.e., where the win probability and the value gap are both large. We show that the resulting measure-valued convex optimization problem admits a closed form solution. A numerical example illustrates the proposed method.

This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.

Landscape Analysis of Simultaneous Blind Deconvolution and Phase Retrieval via Structured Low-Rank Tensor Recovery

Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper presents a geometric analysis of the simultaneous blind deconvolution and phase retrieval (BDPR) problem via a structured low-rank tensor recovery framework. Due to the highly complicated structure of the associated sensing tensor, directly characterizing its optimization landscape is intractable. To address this, we introduce a tensor sensing problem as a tractable surrogate that preserves the essential structural features of the target low-rank tensor while enabling rigorous theoretical analysis. As a first step toward understanding this surrogate model, we study the corresponding population risk, which captures key aspects of the underlying low-rank tensor structure. We characterize the global landscape of the population risk on the unit sphere and show that Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) converges linearly under mild conditions. We then extend the analysis to the tensor sensing problem, establishing local geometric properties, proving convergence guarantees for RGD, and quantifying robustness under measurement noise. Our theoretical results are further supported by extensive numerical experiments. These findings offer foundational insights into the optimization landscape of the structured low-rank tensor recovery problem, which equivalently characterizes the original BDPR problem, thereby providing principled guidance for solving the original BDPR problem.

Hermitian vs non-Hermitian quantum thermometry

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the dephasing dynamics of a qubit as an effective mechanism for estimating the temperature of its surrounding environment for different symmetrizes. Our approach is fundamentally quantum, leveraging the qubit's susceptibility to decoherence without necessitating thermal equilibrium with the system under study. We also examine how symmetry properties affect the accuracy of information retrieval and the robustness of quantum information storage in such systems, highlighting their potential advantages in mitigating decoherence effects. The optimization of quantum Fisher information is performed with respect to both the interaction duration and the environmental temperature, focusing on Ohmic-like spectral density environments. Furthermore, we explicitly identify the optimal qubit measurement that attains the quantum Cramer-Rao bound for precision. Our findings reveal that optimal estimation arises from a complex interplay between the qubit's dephasing dynamics and the Ohmic characteristics of the environment with a particular focus on non-Hermitian systems that exhibit enhanced resilience to decoherence. Notably, optimal estimation does not occur when the qubit reaches a stationary state nor under conditions of complete dephasing.

In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.

Erasing Classical Memory with Quantum Fluctuations: Shannon Information Entropy of Reverse Quantum Annealing

Quantum annealers can provide non-local optimization by tunneling between states in a process that ideally eliminates memory of the initial configuration. We study the crossover between memory loss and retention due to quantum fluctuations, in a transverse Ising model on odd numbered antiferromagnetic rings of thousands of spins with periodic boundary conditions, by performing reverse quantum annealing experiments on three programmable superconducting flux qubit quantum annealers. After initializing the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic domain wall distributions. We demonstrate a clear crossover in memory retention, and its dependence on hardware platform and simulation time. Our approach establishes a general probe of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and memory.

ViSTR-GP: Online Cyberattack Detection via Vision-to-State Tensor Regression and Gaussian Processes in Automated Robotic Operations

Industrial robotic systems are central to automating smart manufacturing operations. Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations. Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework, ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data, collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex instrumentation.

Privacy-Preserving Uncertainty Disclosure for Facilitating Enhanced Energy Storage Dispatch
Ning Qi, Xiaolong Jin, Kai Hou, Zeyu Liu, Hongjie Jia, Wei Wei
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We propose a risk-averse analytical storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming and explicitly account for uncertainty intervals in value function training. We derive real-time marginal value function bounds using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.

Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning

We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.

Beamforming techniques are utilized in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication to address the inherent path loss limitation, thereby establishing and maintaining reliable connections. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduces the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS coordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real-world multi-modal sensing and communication dataset. From the experiment, we observe that the proposed framework achieves up to 77.58% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, outperforms single modalities, incurs roughly as low as 2.32 dB average power loss, and considerably reduces the beam searching space overheads by 76.56% for top-15 beams with respect to standard defined approach.

Maximum diversity, weighting and invariants of time series

Subjects:

Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.

We investigate the conditions under which the Jacobi identity holds for a class of recently introduced anti-symmetric brackets for the hybrid plasma models with kinetic ions and massless electrons. In particular, we establish the precise conditions under which the brackets for the vector-potential-based formulations satisfy the Jacobi identity, and demonstrate that these conditions are fulfilled by all physically relevant functionals. Moreover, for the magnetic-field-based formulation, we show that the corresponding anti-symmetric bracket constitutes a Poisson bracket under the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field, and we provide a direct proof of the Jacobi identity. These results are further extended to models incorporating electron entropy as well as more general hybrid kinetic-fluid models.

On the Monotonicity of relative entropy: A Comparative Study of Petz's and Uhlmann's Approaches

We revisit the monotonicity of relative entropy under the action of quantum channels, a foundational result in quantum information theory. Among the several available proofs, we focus on those by Petz and Uhlmann, which we reformulate within a unified, finite-dimensional operator-theoretic framework. In the first part, we examine Petz's strategy, identify a subtle flaw in his original use of Jensen's contractive operator inequality, and point out how it was corrected to restore the validity of his line of reasoning. In the second part, we develop Uhlmann's approach, which is based on interpolations of positive sesquilinear forms and applies automatically also to non-invertible density operators. By comparing these two approaches, we highlight their complementary strengths: Petz's method is more direct and clear, Uhlmann's is more abstract and general. Our treatment aims to clarify the mathematical structure underlying the monotonicity of relative entropy and to make these proofs more accessible to a broader audience interested in both the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory.

Online Optimization on Hadamard Manifolds: Curvature Independent Regret Bounds on Horospherically Convex Objectives

Subjects:

We study online Riemannian optimization on Hadamard manifolds under the framework of horospherical convexity (h-convexity). Prior work mostly relies on the geodesic convexity (g-convexity), leading to regret bounds scaling poorly with the manifold curvature. To address this limitation, we analyze Riemannian online gradient descent for h-convex and strongly h-convex functions and establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\log(T))$ regret guarantees, respectively. These bounds are curvature-independent and match the results in the Euclidean setting. We validate our approach with experiments on the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices equipped with the affine-invariant metric. In particular, we investigate online Tyler's $M$-estimation and online Fréchet mean computation, showing the application of h-convexity in practice.

An Incentive-Compatible Reward Sharing Mechanism for Mitigating Mirroring Attacks in Decentralized Data-Feed Systems

Decentralized data-feed systems enable blockchain-based smart contracts to access off-chain information by aggregating values from multiple oracles. To improve accuracy, these systems typically use an aggregation function, such as majority voting, to consolidate the inputs they receive from oracles and make a decision. Depending on the final decision and the values reported by the oracles, the participating oracles are compensated through shared rewards. However, such incentive mechanisms are vulnerable to mirroring attacks, where a single user controls multiple oracles to bias the decision of the aggregation function and maximize rewards. This paper analyzes the impact of mirroring attacks on the reliability and dependability of majority voting-based data-feed systems. We demonstrate how existing incentive mechanisms can unintentionally encourage rational users to implement such attacks. To address this, we propose a new incentive mechanism that discourages Sybil behavior. We prove that the proposed mechanism leads to a Nash Equilibrium in which each user operates only one oracle. Finally, we discuss the practical implementation of the proposed incentive mechanism and provide numerical examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Mean first-passage time of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift

49 pages, 4 figures

We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations. The Laplace transforms of these equations induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and the mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ tend to infinity to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.

We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.

Learning to Equalize: Data-Driven Frequency-Domain Signal Recovery in Molecular Communications

Subjects:
Subcellular Processes (q-bio.SC); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In molecular communications (MC), inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise are key factors that degrade communication reliability. Although time-domain equalization can effectively mitigate these effects, it often entails high computational complexity concerning the channel memory. In contrast, frequency-domain equalization (FDE) offers greater computational efficiency but typically requires prior knowledge of the channel model. To address this limitation, this letter proposes FDE techniques based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, enabling temporal correlation modeling in MC channels to improve ISI and noise suppression. To eliminate the reliance on prior channel information in conventional FDE methods, a supervised training strategy is employed for channel-adaptive equalization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-FDE significantly reduces the bit error rate compared to traditional FDE and feedforward neural network-based equalizers. This performance gain is attributed to the LSTM's temporal modeling capabilities, which enhance noise suppression and accelerate model convergence, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

Some Robustness Properties of Label Cleaning

Comments:
39 pages
Subjects:

We demonstrate that learning procedures that rely on aggregated labels, e.g., label information distilled from noisy responses, enjoy robustness properties impossible without data cleaning. This robustness appears in several ways. In the context of risk consistency -- when one takes the standard approach in machine learning of minimizing a surrogate (typically convex) loss in place of a desired task loss (such as the zero-one mis-classification error) -- procedures using label aggregation obtain stronger consistency guarantees than those even possible using raw labels. And while classical statistical scenarios of fitting perfectly-specified models suggest that incorporating all possible information -- modeling uncertainty in labels -- is statistically efficient, consistency fails for ``standard'' approaches as soon as a loss to be minimized is even slightly mis-specified. Yet procedures leveraging aggregated information still converge to optimal classifiers, highlighting how incorporating a fuller view of the data analysis pipeline, from collection to model-fitting to prediction time, can yield a more robust methodology by refining noisy signals.

Symmetry Groups of Basins of Attraction in Equivariant Dynamical Systems

This paper investigates the symmetry properties of basins of attraction and their boundaries in equivariant dynamical systems. While the symmetry groups of compact attractors are well understood, the corresponding analysis for non-compact basins and their boundaries has remained underdeveloped. We establish a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating the hierarchical inclusion of a chain of symmetry groups, showing that boundary symmetries can strictly exceed those of attractors and their basins. To determine admissible symmetry groups of basin boundaries, we propose three complementary approaches: (i) thickening transfer, which connects admissibility results from compact attractors to basins; (ii) algebraic constraints, which exploit the closed nature of boundaries to impose structural restrictions; and (iii) connectivity and flow analysis, which analyzes how the system's dynamics permute states. Numerical experiments on the Thomas system confirm these theoretical results, illustrating that cyclic group actions permute basins while preserving their common boundary, whereas central inversion leaves both basins and boundaries invariant. These findings reveal that basin boundaries often exhibit higher symmetry than the attractors they separate, providing new insights into the geometry of multistable systems and suggesting broader applications to physical and biological models where basin structure determines stability and predictability.

The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs

Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.

Long-time dynamics and universality of nonconvex gradient descent

This paper develops a general approach to characterize the long-time trajectory behavior of nonconvex gradient descent in generalized single-index models in the large aspect ratio regime. In this regime, we show that for each iteration the gradient descent iterate concentrates around a deterministic vector called the `Gaussian theoretical gradient descent', whose dynamics can be tracked by a state evolution system of two recursive equations for two scalars. Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of design matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic convergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient descent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and strongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as the `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models under Gaussian data.
As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two applications of different natures in the regression setting. In the first, we prove global convergence of nonconvex gradient descent with general independent initialization for a broad class of structured link functions, and establish universality of randomly initialized gradient descent in phase retrieval for large aspect ratios. In the second, we develop a data-free iterative algorithm for estimating state evolution parameters along the entire gradient descent trajectory, thereby providing a low-cost yet statistically valid tool for practical tasks such as hyperparameter tuning and runtime determination.
As a by-product of our analysis, we show that in the large aspect ratio regime, the Gaussian theoretical gradient descent coincides with a recent line of dynamical mean-field theory for gradient descent over the constant-time horizon.

Large language model-empowered next-generation computer-aided engineering

Software development has entered a new era where large language models (LLMs) now serve as general-purpose reasoning engines, enabling natural language interaction and transformative applications across diverse domains. This paradigm is now extending into computer-aided engineering (CAE). Recent applications of LLMs in CAE have successfully automated routine tasks, including CAD model generation and FEM simulations. Nevertheless, these contributions, which primarily serve to reduce manual labor, are often insufficient for addressing the significant computational challenges posed by large-scale, high-dimensional systems. To this aim, we first introduce the concept of LLM-empowered CAE agent, where LLMs act as autonomous collaborators that plan, execute, and adapt CAE workflows. Then, we propose an LLM-empowered CAE agent for data-free model order reduction (MOR), a powerful yet underused approach for ultra-fast large-scale parametric analysis due to the intrusive nature and labor-intensive redevelopment of solvers. LLMs can alleviate this barrier by automating derivations, code restructuring, and implementation, making intrusive MOR both practical and broadly accessible. To demonstrate feasibility, we present an LLM-empowered CAE agent for solving ultra-large-scale space-parameter-time (S-P-T) physical problems using Tensor-decomposition-based A Priori Surrogates (TAPS). Our results show that natural language prompts describing parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) can be translated into efficient solver implementations, substantially reducing human effort while producing high-fidelity reduced-order models. Moreover, LLMs can synthesize novel MOR solvers for unseen cases such as nonlinear and high-dimensional parametric problems based on their internal knowledge base. This highlights the potential of LLMs to establish the foundation for next-generation CAE systems.

The widely studied edge modification problems ask how to minimally alter a graph to satisfy certain structural properties. In this paper, we introduce and study a new edge modification problem centered around transforming a given graph into a triangle-covered graph (one in which every vertex belongs to at least one triangle). We first present tight lower bounds on the number of edges in any connected triangle-covered graph of order $n$, and then we characterize all connected graphs that attain this minimum edge count. For a graph $G$, we define the notion of a $\Delta$-completion set as a set of non-edges of $G$ whose addition to $G$ results in a triangle-covered graph. We prove that the decision problem of finding a $\Delta$-completion set of size at most $t\geq0$ is $\mathbb{NP}$-complete and does not admit a constant-factor approximation algorithm under standard complexity assumptions. Moreover, we show that this problem remains $\mathbb{NP}$-complete even when the input is restricted to connected bipartite graphs. We then study the problem from an algorithmic perspective, providing tight bounds on the minimum $\Delta$-completion set size for several graph classes, including trees, chordal graphs, and cactus graphs. Furthermore, we show that the triangle-covered problem admits an $(\ln n +1)$-approximation algorithm for general graphs. For trees and chordal graphs, we design algorithms that compute minimum $\Delta$-completion sets. Finally, we show that the threshold for a random graph $\mathbb{G}(n, p)$ to be triangle-covered occurs at $n^{-2/3}$.

Estimation of an optical beam's transverse displacement is a canonical imaging problem fundamental to numerous optical imaging and sensing tasks. Quantum enhancements to the measurement precision in this problem have been studied extensively. However, previous studies have neither accounted for diffraction loss in full generality, nor have they addressed how to jointly optimize the spatial mode and the balance between squeezing and coherent amplitude. Here we show that, in the small-displacement limit, the seemingly intractable infinite-spatial-mode problem can be reduced to a compact three-mode interaction framework. We quantify the improvement afforded by an optimized single-spatial-mode Gaussian-state probe over the optimal classical laser probe, and show that a two-spatial-mode homodyne receiver is asymptotically optimal for the former in the limit of high probe energy. Our findings reveal a strategy for identifying quantum-optimal probes in the presence of generic multimode linear probe-target interaction and photon loss.

Motivated by the constant modulus property of frequency shift keying (FSK) based waveforms and the stabilisation of its radar performance with an increase in the number of subpulses, in this paper an FSK-based dynamic subpulse number joint communications and radar waveform design is proposed. From a communications point of view, the system operates based on traditional FSK modulation. From a sensing point of view, although the subpulses are continuously generated and transmitted, radar waveforms are dynamically formed by monitoring the flatness of the spectrum which in turn guarantees the accuracy of the delay estimation. Other constraints on the waveform length are used to ensure satisfactory values of the root mean square time duration, ambiguity function sidelobe levels and prevent overly long waveforms. To provide an estimation of the probability of generating extremely long waveforms, the distribution of the number of subpulses is approximated using a Brownian motion process and an existing result on its one-sided exit density. Numerical examples are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate distribution, as well as the ambiguity function sidelobe levels and the delay and Doppler shift estimation performance of the transmitted waveforms.

The construction, dubbed a "reflective" topological big bang, generalizes Schrodinger's elliptic de Sitter space and is built to be compatible with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) picture of the large-scale universe, only minimally modifying it via some nontrivial topology at an earliest "moment" in the universe's history. We establish a mathematical characterization of the admissible topological structures of reflective topological big bangs, and we discuss implications for a standard concern in cosmology, the horizon problem. We present a nonreflective example that we've christened the Itty-Bitty Blender spacetime: this spacetime and its universal cover, the Eternal Trumpet spacetime, exhibit interesting potential structures of spacetimes avoiding the Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems.

This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.

Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d>0$. Their form reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the Schrödinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension $d^*=2$.

There is an increasing push for operational measures to reduce ships' bunker fuel consumption and carbon emissions, driven by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) mandates. Key performance indicators such as the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) focus on fuel efficiency. Strategies like trim optimization, virtual arrival, and green routing have emerged. The theoretical basis for these approaches lies in accurate prediction of fuel consumption as a function of sailing speed, displacement, trim, climate, and sea state.
This study utilized 296 voyage reports from a bulk carrier vessel over one year (November 16, 2021 to November 21, 2022) and 28 parameters, integrating hydrometeorological big data from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with 19 parameters and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with 61 parameters. The objective was to evaluate whether fusing external public data sources enhances modeling accuracy and to highlight the most influential parameters affecting fuel consumption.
The results reveal a strong potential for machine learning techniques to predict ship fuel consumption accurately by combining voyage reports with climate and sea data. However, validation on similar classes of vessels remains necessary to confirm generalizability.

Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Information Theory (cs.IT)
In Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks with multi-hop communication, Road Side Units (RSUs) intend to gather location data from the vehicles to offer various location-based services. Although vehicles use the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation, they may refrain from sharing their exact GPS coordinates to the RSUs due to privacy considerations. Thus, to address the localization expectations of the RSUs and the privacy concerns of the vehicles, we introduce a relaxed-privacy model wherein the vehicles share their partial location information in order to avail the location-based services. To implement this notion of relaxed-privacy, we propose a low-latency protocol for spatial-provenance recovery, wherein vehicles use correlated linear Bloom filters to embed their position information. Our proposed spatial-provenance recovery process takes into account the resolution of localization, the underlying ad hoc protocol, and the coverage range of the wireless technology used by the vehicles. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we present extensive analysis on the underlying trade-off between relaxed-privacy and the communication-overhead of the protocol. Finally, using a wireless testbed, we show that our proposed method requires a few bits in the packet header to provide security features such as localizing a low-power jammer executing a denial-of-service attack.

Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.

There, we show that it is beneficial to restart at a lower rate once you are closer to your intended target.

In this work, we investigate new solutions to the decoration transformation in terms of various special functions, including the hyperbolic gamma function, the basic hypergeometric function, and the Euler gamma function. These solutions to the symmetry transformation are important to decorate Ising-like integrable lattice spin models obtained via the gauge/YBE correspondence. The integral identities represented as the solution of the decoration transformation are derived from the three-dimensional partition functions and superconformal index for the dual supersymmetric gauge theories.

Numerical analysis of fluid estimation for source terms in neutral particles simulation

Subjects:

In plasma edge simulations, kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) is often used to simulate neutral particles and estimate source terms. For large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high particle collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost for such schemes. To address this challenge, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method and a corresponding fluid estimation technique have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we perform numerical analysis on the convergence of KDMC with the fluid estimation. To do so, we compare the accuracy of the analyzed algorithm with the accuracy of an approximate fluid method using the kinetic MC method as a reference. In a one-dimensional test case, KDMC with the fluid estimation achieves at least one order of magnitude lower errors than the fluid method for both high- and low-collisional regimes. Moreover, KDMC with the fluid estimation outperforms the kinetic MC method with a clear speed-up. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of the discussed algorithm.

This study develops and evaluates a novel hybridWavelet SARIMA Transformer, WST framework to forecast using monthly rainfall across five meteorological subdivisions of Northeast India over the 1971 to 2023 period. The approach employs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, MODWT with four wavelet families such as, Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Coiflet etc. to achieve shift invariant, multiresolution decomposition of the rainfall series. Linear and seasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear components are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are reconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20 train test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, Willmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes E1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across all subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger agreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand alone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual adequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams provided an inte- grated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE, further reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiresolution signal decomposition with complementary linear and deep learning models for hydroclimatic forecasting. Beyond rainfall, the proposed WST framework offers a scalable methodology for forecasting complex environmental time series, with direct implications for flood risk management, water resources planning, and climate adaptation strategies in data-sparse and climate-sensitive regions.

Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states

Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $°(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
\[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
\] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.

Low-rank Orthogonalization for Large-scale Matrix Optimization with Applications to Foundation Model Training

Comments:

Neural network (NN) training is inherently a large-scale matrix optimization problem, yet the matrix structure of NN parameters has long been overlooked. Recently, the optimizer Muon \cite{jordanmuon}, which explicitly exploits this structure, has gained significant attention for its strong performance in foundation model training. A key component contributing to Muon's success is matrix orthogonalization. In this paper, we propose {\it low-rank orthogonalization}, which explicitly leverages the low-rank nature of gradients during NN training. Building on this, we propose low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent and a low-rank variant of Muon. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of low-rank orthogonalization, with the low-rank Muon achieving promising results in GPT-2 and LLaMA pretraining -- surpassing the performance of the carefully tuned vanilla Muon. Theoretically, we establish the iteration complexity of the low-rank matrix-signed gradient descent for finding an approximate stationary solution, as well as that of low-rank Muon for finding an approximate stochastic stationary solution under heavy-tailed noise.

A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for Rényi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling Rényi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.

Modeling Non-Uniform Hypergraphs Using Determinantal Point Processes
Yichao Chen, Jingfei Zhang, Ji Zhu
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Most statistical models for networks focus on pairwise interactions between nodes. However, many real-world networks involve higher-order interactions among multiple nodes, such as co-authors collaborating on a paper. Hypergraphs provide a natural representation for these networks, with each hyperedge representing a set of nodes. The majority of existing hypergraph models assume uniform hyperedges (i.e., edges of the same size) or rely on diversity among nodes. In this work, we propose a new hypergraph model based on non-symmetric determinantal point processes. The proposed model naturally accommodates non-uniform hyperedges, has tractable probability mass functions, and accounts for both node similarity and diversity in hyperedges. For model estimation, we maximize the likelihood function under constraints using a computationally efficient projected adaptive gradient descent algorithm. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. Simulation studies confirm the efficacy of the proposed model, and its utility is further demonstrated through edge predictions on several real-world datasets.

We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.

Learning Neural Networks by Neuron Pursuit

Subjects:

The first part of this paper studies the evolution of gradient flow for homogeneous neural networks near a class of saddle points exhibiting a sparsity structure. The choice of these saddle points is motivated from previous works on homogeneous networks, which identified the first saddle point encountered by gradient flow after escaping the origin. It is shown here that, when initialized sufficiently close to such saddle points, gradient flow remains near the saddle point for a sufficiently long time, during which the set of weights with small norm remain small but converge in direction. Furthermore, important empirical observations are made on the behavior of gradient descent after escaping these saddle points. The second part of the paper, motivated by these results, introduces a greedy algorithm to train deep neural networks called Neuron Pursuit (NP). It is an iterative procedure which alternates between expanding the network by adding neuron(s) with carefully chosen weights, and minimizing the training loss using this augmented network. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using numerical experiments.

Tempering is a popular tool in Bayesian computation, being used to transform a posterior distribution $p_1$ into a reference distribution $p_0$ that is more easily approximated. Several algorithms exist that start by approximating $p_0$ and proceed through a sequence of intermediate distributions $p_t$ until an approximation to $p_1$ is obtained. Our contribution reveals that high-quality approximation of terms up to $p_1$ is not essential, as knowledge of the intermediate distributions enables posterior quantities of interest to be extrapolated. Specifically, we establish conditions under which posterior expectations are determined by their associated tempered expectations on any non-empty $t$ interval. Harnessing this result, we propose novel methodology for approximating posterior expectations based on extrapolation and smoothing of tempered expectations, which we implement as a post-processing variance-reduction tool for sequential Monte Carlo.

We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.

Model selection in non-linear models often prioritizes performance metrics over statistical tests, limiting the ability to account for sampling variability. We propose the use of a statistical test to assess the equality of variances in forecasting errors. The test builds upon the classic Morgan-Pitman approach, incorporating enhancements to ensure robustness against data with heavy-tailed distributions or outliers with high variance, plus a strategy to make residuals from machine learning models statistically independent. Through a series of simulations and real-world data applications, we demonstrate the test's effectiveness and practical utility, offering a reliable tool for model evaluation and selection in diverse contexts.

The consumption function maps current wealth and the exogenous state to current consumption. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a consumption function when the agent has a preference for wealth. When the period utility functions are restricted to power functions, we prove that the consumption function is asymptotically linear as wealth tends to infinity and provide a complete characterization of the asymptotic slopes. When the risk aversion with respect to wealth is less than that for consumption, the asymptotic slope is zero regardless of other model parameters, implying wealthy households save a large fraction of their income, consistent with empirical evidence.

Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. For $p$ in $M$, the tensor algebra of the negative part of the (complex) affinization of the tangent space of $M$ at $p$ has a natural structure of a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra. These meromorphic open-string vertex algebras form a vector bundle over $M$ with a connection. We construct a sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ of meromorphic open-string vertex algebras on the sheaf of parallel sections of this vector bundle. Using covariant derivatives, we construct representations on the spaces of complex smooth functions of the algebras of parallel tensor fields. These representations are used to construct a sheaf $\mathcal{W}$ of left $\mathcal{V}$-modules generated by the sheaf of smooth functions. In particular, we obtain a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ and a left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{W}$. By the definitions of meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left module, we obtain, among many other properties, operator product expansion for vertex operators. We also show that the Laplacian on M is in fact a component of a vertex operator for the left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ restricted to the space of smooth functions.

This paper analyzes new classes of preradicals defined as weak forms of left exact and idempotent preradicals. We introduce prehereditary preradicals to generalize the hereditary property, and essentially idempotent and weakly idempotent preradicals to generalize idempotency. Our motivation is to study the concept of relative injectivity. We show that these new classes facilitate the extension of classical results on injectivity with respect to a hereditary torsion theory to a broader context, requiring weaker assumptions.

In this paper we introduce the Constant Width Measure Set, which measures the constant width property of an oval, i.e. the planar simple closed strictly convex curve. We study its geometrical properties.
We find the exact relation between the length and the area of the region bounded by an oval $M$. Namely, the following equality is fulfilled: \begin{align*} L_{M}^2 &=4\pi A_M+8\pi\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{E}_{\frac{1}{2}}(M)}\right|+\pi\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{CWMS}(M)}\right|, \end{align*} where $L_{M}, A_{M}, \widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{E}_{\frac{1}{2}}(M)}, \widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{CWMS}(M)}$ are the length of $M$, the area bounded by $M$, the oriented area of the Wigner caustic of $M$ and the oriented area of the Constant Width Measure Set of $M$, respectively.
Furthermore we study the geometry of the Spherical Measure Set, which is an offset of a curve with a special distance. We show that the oriented area of this set of an oval $M$, $\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{SMS}(M)}$, satisfies the following equality: \begin{align*} 4\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{SMS}(M)}\right|=8\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{E}_{\frac{1}{2}}(M)}\right|+\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{CWMS}(M)}\right|. \end{align*}

In particular, this leads to a counterexample to a question of Campana-Peternell.

One can operate with an LRA superfast -- by using much fewer memory cells and flops than an input matrix has entries. Can we, however, compute an LRA of a matrix superfast? YES and NO. For worst case inputs, any LRA algorithm fails miserably unless it involves all input entries, but in computational practice worst case inputs seem to appear rarely, and accurate LRA are routinely computed superfast for large and important classes of matrices, in particular in the memory efficient form of CUR, widely used in data analysis. We advance formal study of this YES and NO coexistence by proving novel universal upper bounds on the spectral output error norms of all CUR LRA algorithms and, under a fixed probabilistic structure in the space of input matrices, on both spectral and Frobenius error norms of nearly all sketching LRA algorithms. These bounds imply that superfast LRA algorithms of the two kinds fail miserably only for a very narrow input class. Furthermore, in our numerical tests such superfast algorithms were consistently much more accurate than our upper estimates ensure and usually were reasonably close to optimal.

On non-commutative Euler systems, I: preliminaries on `det' and `Fit'

Comments:
42 pages, to appear in Kyoto Journal of Mathematics
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We extend some classical constructions in commutative algebra to the setting of modules over orders in (non-commutative) semisimple algebras. Our theory incorporates, inter alia, `reduced' versions of the notions of higher Fitting invariants and higher exterior powers and of the Grothendieck-Knudsen-Mumford determinant functor on perfect complexes. In a companion article, these results are used to develop a theory of non-commutative Euler systems for $p$-adic representations.

We consider deformations of a pair $(X,\partial X)$, where $X$ is an affine toric Gorenstein variety and $\partial X$ is its boundary. We compute the tangent and obstruction space for the corresponding deformation functor and for an admissible lattice degree $m$ we construct the miniversal deformation of $(X,\partial X)$ in degrees $-km$, for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$. This in particular generalizes Altmann's construction of the miniversal deformation of an isolated Gorenstein toric singularity to an arbitrary non-isolated Gorenstein toric singularity. Moreover, we show that the irreducible components of the reduced miniversal deformation are in one to one correspondence with maximal Minkowski decompositions of the polytope $P\cap (m=1)$, where $P$ is the lattice polytope defining $X$.

Eigen-convergence of Gaussian kernelized graph Laplacian by manifold heat interpolation

This updated arXiv version is to correct a typo in the condition of Theorem 6.7 in the published version. Specifically, the assumption of density p is as in Assumption 1(A2), instead of assuming p uniform. Section 6 is to handle non-uniform density p, and the proved rates are same as in the density uniform case

This work studies the spectral convergence of graph Laplacian to the Laplace-Beltrami operator when the graph affinity matrix is constructed from $N$ random samples on a $d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high dimensional space. By analyzing Dirichlet form convergence and constructing candidate approximate eigenfunctions via convolution with manifold heat kernel, we prove that, with Gaussian kernel, one can set the kernel bandwidth parameter $\epsilon \sim (\log N/ N)^{1/(d/2+2)}$ such that the eigenvalue convergence rate is $N^{-1/(d/2+2)}$ and the eigenvector convergence in 2-norm has rate $N^{-1/(d+4)}$; When $\epsilon \sim (\log N/N)^{1/(d/2+3)}$, both eigenvalue and eigenvector rates are $N^{-1/(d/2+3)}$. These rates are up to a $\log N$ factor and proved for finitely many low-lying eigenvalues. The result holds for un-normalized and random-walk graph Laplacians when data are uniformly sampled on the manifold, as well as the density-corrected graph Laplacian (where the affinity matrix is normalized by the degree matrix from both sides) with non-uniformly sampled data. As an intermediate result, we prove new point-wise and Dirichlet form convergence rates for the density-corrected graph Laplacian. Numerical results are provided to verify the theory.

Let $A$ and $B$ be $C^*$-algebras with $A$ separable, let $I$ be an ideal in $B$, and let $\psi\colon A\to B/I$ be a completely positive contractive linear map. We show that there is a continuous family $\Theta_t\colon A\to B$, for $t\in [1,\infty)$, of lifts of $\psi$ that are asymptotically linear, asymptotically completely positive and asymptotically contractive. If $\psi$ is of order zero, then $\Theta_t$ can be chosen to have this property asymptotically. If $A$ and $B$ carry continuous actions of a second countable locally compact group $G$ such that $I$ is $G$-invariant and $\psi$ is equivariant, we show that the family $\Theta_t$ can be chosen to be asymptotically equivariant. If a linear completely positive lift for $\psi$ exists, we can arrange that $\Theta_t$ is linear and completely positive for all $t\in [1,\infty)$. In the equivariant setting, if $A$, $B$ and $\psi$ are unital, we show that asymptotically linear unital lifts are only guaranteed to exist if $G$ is amenable. This leads to a new characterization of amenability in terms of the existence of asymptotically equivariant unital sections for quotient maps.

An iterative Jacobi-like algorithm to compute a few sparse approximate eigenvectors
Cristian Rusu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that approximates the extreme eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of a symmetric matrix. The proposed algorithm can be viewed as an extension of the Jacobi eigenvalue method for symmetric matrices diagonalization to the case where we want to approximate just a few extreme eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The method is also particularly well-suited for the computation of sparse approximations of the eigenvectors. In fact, we show that in general, our method provides a trade-off between the sparsity of the computed approximate eigenspaces and their accuracy. We provide theoretical results that show the linear convergence of the proposed method. Finally, we show experimental numerical results for sparse low-rank approximations of random symmetric matrices and show applications to graph Fourier transforms, and the sparse principal component analysis in image classification experiments. These applications are chosen because, in these cases, there is no need to perform the eigenvalue decomposition to high precision to achieve good numerical results.

Gaussian fluctuations for spin systems and point processes: near-optimal rates via quantitative Marcinkiewicz's theorem

We establish asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations for functionals of a large class of spin models and strongly correlated random point fields, achieving near-optimal rates. For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor.

Optimal Weights in a Two-Tier Voting System with Mean-Field Voters

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
We analyse two-tier voting systems with voters described by a multi-group mean-field model that allows for correlated voters both within groups as well as across group boundaries. In this model voters are influenced by voters within their group (constituency, member state, etc.) in a positive way. Across group boundaries positive or negative influence is considered. The objective is to determine the optimal weights each group receives in the council, the upper level of the voting system, to minimise the expected quadratic deviation of the council vote from a hypothetical referendum of the overall population in the large population limit. The mean-field model exhibits different behaviour depending on the intensity of interactions between voters. When interaction is weak, we obtain optimal weights given by the sum of a constant term and a term proportional to the square root of the group's population. When interaction is strong, the optimal weights are in general not uniquely determined. Indeed, when all groups are positively coupled, any assignation of weights is optimal. For two competing clusters of groups, the difference in total weights must be a specific number, but the assignation of weights within each cluster is arbitrary. We also obtain conditions for both interaction regimes under which it is impossible to reach the minimal democracy deficit as some of the weights may be negative.

Consider $L$ users, who each hold private data, and one fusion center who must compute a function of the private data of the $L$ users. To accomplish this task, each user may utilize a public and noiseless broadcast channel in a non-interactive manner. In this setting, and in the absence of any additional resources such as secure links, we study the optimal communication rates and minimum information leakages on the private user data that are achievable. Specifically, we study the information leakage of the user data at the fusion center (beyond the knowledge of the function output), as well as at predefined groups of colluding users who eavesdrop one another. We derive the capacity region when the user data is independent, and inner and outer regions for the capacity region when the user data is correlated.

Bending Teichmüller spaces and character varieties

We consider the mapping $b_L\colon\mathcal{T} \to \chi$ of the Fricke-Teichmüller space $\mathcal{T}$ into the $\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{C}$-character variety $\chi$ of the surface, obtained by holonomy representations of bent hyperbolic surfaces along a fixed measured lamination $L$. We prove that this mapping is an equivariant symplectic real-analytic embedding, and, for almost all measured laminations, proper.
In addition, we show that this "being map'' $b_L\colon \mathcal{T} \to \chi$ continuously extends to a mapping from the Thurston boundary of $\mathcal{T}$ to the Morgan-Shalen boundary of $\chi$ as the identity map almost everywhere.
Moreover, we complexify this real analytic subvariety ${\rm Im}\, b_L$ by symplecitcaly embedding it in the product variety $\chi \times \chi$ by the diagonal mapping twisted by complex conjugation. We geometrically construct a closed $\mathbb{C}$-symplectic complex analytic subvariety of $\chi \times \chi$ containing ${\rm Im}\, b_L$ as a half-dimensional real analytic subvariety.

On integral local Shimura varieties

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We give a construction of "integral local Shimura varieties" which are formal schemes that generalize the well-known integral models of the Drinfeld $p$-adic upper half spaces. The construction applies to all classical groups, at least for odd $p$. These formal schemes also generalize the formal schemes defined by Rapoport-Zink via moduli of $p$-divisible groups, and are characterized purely in group-theoretic terms. More precisely, for a local $p$-adic Shimura datum $(G, b, \mu)$ and a quasi-parahoric group scheme $\mathcal G$ for $G$, Scholze has defined a functor on perfectoid spaces which parametrizes $p$-adic shtukas. He conjectured that this functor is representable by a normal formal scheme which is locally formally of finite type and flat over $O_{\breve E}$. Scholze-Weinstein proved this conjecture when $(G, b, \mu)$ is of (P)EL type by using Rapoport-Zink formal schemes. We prove this conjecture for any $(G, \mu)$ of abelian type when $p\neq 2$, and when $p=2$ and $G$ is of type $A$ or $C$. We also relate the generic fiber of this formal scheme to the local Shimura variety, a rigid-analytic space attached by Scholze to $(G, b, \mu, {\mathcal G})$.

A universal finite type invariant of knots in homology 3-spheres

Comments:

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
An essential goal in the study of finite type invariants of some objects (knots, manifolds) is the construction of a universal finite type invariant, universal in the sense that it contains all finite type invariants of the given objects. Such a universal finite type invariant is known for knots in the 3-sphere --the Kontsevich integral-- and for homology 3-spheres --the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant. For knots in homology 3-spheres, an invariant constructed by Garoufalidis and Kricker as a lift of the Kontsevich integral has been considered for the last two decades as the best candidate to be a universal finite type invariant. Although this invariant is eventually universal in restriction to knots whose Alexander polynomial is trivial, we prove here that it is not powerful enough in general. For that we provide a refinement of its construction which produces a strictly stronger invariant, and we prove that this new invariant is a universal finite type invariant of knots in homology 3-spheres. This provides a full diagrammatic description of the graded space of finite type invariants of knots in homology 3-spheres.

Optimal empirical Bayes estimation for the Poisson model via minimum-distance methods

Subjects:

The Robbins estimator is the most iconic and widely used procedure in the empirical Bayes literature for the Poisson model. On one hand, this method has been recently shown to be minimax optimal in terms of the regret (excess risk over the Bayesian oracle that knows the true prior) for various nonparametric classes of priors. On the other hand, it has been long recognized in practice that the Robbins estimator lacks the desired smoothness and monotonicity of Bayes estimators and can be easily derailed by those data points that were rarely observed before. Based on the minimum-distance distance method, we propose a suite of empirical Bayes estimators, including the classical nonparametric maximum likelihood, that outperform the Robbins method in a variety of synthetic and real data sets and retain its optimality in terms of minimax regret.

An effective exact method is proposed for computing generalized eigenspaces of a matrix of integers or rational numbers. Keys of our approach are the use of minimal annihilating polynomials and the concept of the Jourdan-Krylov basis. A new method, called Jordan-Krylov elimination, is introduced to design an algorithm for computing Jordan-Krylov basis. The resulting algorithm outputs generalized eigenspaces as a form of Jordan chains. Notably, in the output, components of generalized eigenvectors are expressed as polynomials in the associated eigenvalue as a variable.

Let $L$ be an $n\times n$ array whose top left $r\times r$ subarray is filled with $k$ different symbols, each occurring at most once in each row and at most once in each column. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure the remaining cells of $L$ can be filled such that each symbol occurs at most once in each row and at most once in each column, $L$ is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, and each symbol occurs a prescribed number of times in $L$. The case where the prescribed number of times each symbol occurs is $n$ was solved by Cruse (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 16 (1974), 18--22), and the case where the top left subarray is $r\times n$ and the symmetry is not required, was settled by Goldwasser et al. (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 130 (2015), 26--41). Our result allows the entries of the main diagonal to be specified as well, which leads to an extension of the Andersen-Hoffman Theorem (Annals of Disc. Math. 15 (1982) 9--26, European J. Combin. 4 (1983) 33--35).

Completing partial latin squares is NP-complete. Motivated by Ryser's theorem for latin rectangles, in 1974, Cruse found conditions that ensure a partial symmetric latin square of order $m$ can be embedded in a symmetric latin square of order $n$. Loosely speaking, this results asserts that an $n$-coloring of the edges of the complete $m$-vertex graph $K_m$ can be embedded in a one-factorization of $K_n$ if and only if $n$ is even and the number of edges of each color is at least $m-n/2$. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which an edge-coloring of the complete $\lambda$-fold $m$-vertex 3-graph $\lambda K_m^3$ can be embedded in a one-factorization of $\lambda K_n^3$. In particular, we prove the first known Ryser type theorem for hypergraphs by showing that if $n \equiv 0 \;(\bmod\; 3)$, any edge-coloring of $\lambda K_m^3$ where the number of triples of each color is at least $m/2-n/6$, can be embedded in a one-factorization of $\lambda K_n^3$. Finally we prove an Evans type result by showing that if $n \equiv 0 \;(\bmod\; 3)$ and $n\geq 3m$, then any $q$-coloring of the edges of any $F\subseteq\lambda K_m^3$ can be embedded in a one-factorization of $\lambda K_n^3$ as long as $q\leq \lambda \binom{n-1}{2}-\lambda \binom{m}{3}/\left\lfloor m/3 \right\rfloor$.

On the Multi-Robber Damage Number
Miloš Stojaković, Lasse Wulf
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
We study a variant of the Cops and Robbers game on graphs in which the robbers damage the visited vertices, aiming to maximize the number of damaged vertices. For that game with one cop against $s$ robbers a conjecture was made by Carlson, Halloran and Reinhart that the cop can save three vertices from being damaged as soon as the maximum degree of the base graph is at least $\binom{s}{2} + 2$.
We are able to verify the conjecture and prove that it is tight once we add the assumption that the base graph is triangle free. We also study the game without that assumption, disproving the conjecture in full generality and further attempting to locate the smallest maximum degree of a base graph which guarantees that the cop can save three vertices against $s$ robbers. We show that this number is between $2\binom{s}{2} - 3$ and $2\binom{s}{2} + 1$.
Furthermore, after the game has been previously studied with one cop and multiple robbers, as well as with one robber and multiple cops, we initiate the study of the game with two cops and two robbers. In the case when the base graph is a cycle we determine the exact number of damaged vertices. Additionally, when the base graph is a path we provide bounds that differ by an additive constant.

On non-commutative Iwasawa theory and derivatives of Euler systems
David Burns, Takamichi Sano
Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We use the theory of reduced determinant functors from [24] to give a new, computationally useful, description of the relative $K_0$-groups of orders in finite dimensional separable algebras that need not be commutative. By combining this approach with a canonical generalization to non-commutative algebras of the notion of `zeta element' introduced by Kato [52], we then formulate, for each odd prime $p$, a natural main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary number fields. This conjecture predicts a simple relation between a canonical Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that we introduce and the compactly supported $p$-adic cohomology of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and is shown to simultaneously extend both the higher rank (commutative) main conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ formulated by Kurihara and the present authors [19] and the $K$-theoretical formalism of main conjectures in non-commutative Iwasawa theory developed by Ritter and Weiss [73] and by Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob [27]. In particular, via these links we obtain strong evidence in support of the conjecture in the setting of Galois CM extensions of totally real fields. Our approach also leads to the formulation over arbitrary number fields of a precise conjectural `higher derivative formula' for the Rubin-Stark non-commutative Euler system that is shown to recover upon appropriate specialisation the classical Gross-Stark Conjecture for Deligne-Ribet $p$-adic $L$-functions. We then show that this conjectural derivative formula can be combined with the main conjecture of non-commutative $p$-adic Iwasawa theory to give a strategy for obtaining evidence in support of the equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for $\mathbb{G}_m$ over arbitrary finite Galois extensions of number fields, thereby obtaining a wide-ranging generalization of the main result of [19].

We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.

Our construction is based on an uncountably large collection of factor-closed, well-quasi-ordered binary languages due to Pouzet.

Compact Brownian surfaces II. Orientable surfaces

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Fix an arbitrary compact orientable surface with a boundary and consider a uniform bipartite random quadrangulation of this surface with $n$ faces and boundary component lengths of order $\sqrt n$ or of lower order. Endow this quadrangulation with the usual graph metric renormalized by $n^{-1/4}$, mark it on each boundary component, and endow it with the counting measure on its vertex set renormalized by $n^{-1}$, as well as the counting measure on each boundary component renormalized by $n^{-1/2}$. We show that, as $n\to\infty$, this random marked measured metric space converges in distribution for the Gromov--Hausdorff--Prokhorov topology, toward a random limiting marked measured metric space called a Brownian surface.
This extends known convergence results of uniform random planar quadrangulations with at most one boundary component toward the Brownian sphere and toward the Brownian disk, by considering the case of quadrangulations on general compact orientable surfaces. Our approach consists in cutting a Brownian surface into elementary pieces that are naturally related to the Brownian sphere and the Brownian disk and their noncompact analogs, the Brownian plane and the Brownian half-plane, and to prove convergence results for these elementary pieces, which are of independent interest.

Relevant physical phenomena are described by nonlinear Schrödinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity. This paper investigates the respective 2D and 3D Cauchy problems. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities, merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions, is proven, providing the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity. The critical nonlinearity will be simply a byproduct of our analysis and the existing literature. Under an assumption that prevents the onset of a Benjamin-Feir type instability, global well-posedness in the energy space is proven for a) non-negative Hamiltonians, b) sign-indefinite Hamiltonians under additional assumptions on the zeros of the nonlinearity, c) generic nonlinearities and small initial data. The cases b) and c) only concern the 3D case

Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory

Today, the vast majority of the world's digital information is represented using the fundamental assumption, introduced by Claude Shannon in 1948, that ``...the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem (of the design of communication systems)...''. Consider, nonetheless, the observation that we often combine a message with other information in order to deduce new facts, thereby expanding the value of such a message. It is noteworthy that to-date, no rigorous theory of communication has been put forth which postulates the existence of deductive capabilities on the receiver's side.
The purpose of this paper is to present such a theory. We formally model such deductive capabilities using logic reasoning, and present a rigorous theory which covers the following generic scenario: Alice and Bob each have knowledge of some logic sentence, and they wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic sentence that Alice knows to be true, but that Bob currently cannot prove. Many variants of this general setup are considered in this article; in all cases we are able to provide sharp upper and lower bounds. Our contribution includes the identification of the most fundamental requirements that we place on a logic and associated logical language for all of our results to apply. Practical algorithms that are in some cases asymptotically optimal are provided, and we illustrate the potential practical value of the design of communication systems that incorporate the assumption of deductive capabilities at the receiver using experimental results that suggest significant possible gains compared to classical systems.

Equivariant toric geometry and Euler-Maclaurin formulae

We consider equivariant versions of the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch characteristic classes of a quasi-projective toric variety, and extend many known results from non-equivariant to the equivariant setting. The corresponding generalized equivariant Hirzebruch genus of a torus-invariant Cartier divisor is also calculated. Further global formulae for equivariant Hirzebruch classes are obtained in the simplicial context by using the Cox construction and the equivariant Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorem. Alternative proofs of all these results are given via localization at the torus fixed points in equivariant K- and homology theories. In localized equivariant K-theory, we prove a weighted version of a classical formula of Brion for a full-dimensional lattice polytope. We also generalize to the context of motivic Chern classes the Molien formula of Brion-Vergne. Similarly, we compute the localized Hirzebruch class, extending results of Brylinski-Zhang for the localized Todd class.
We also elaborate on the relation between the equivariant toric geometry via the equivariant Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch and Euler-Maclaurin type formulae for full-dimensional simple lattice polytopes. Our results provide generalizations to arbitrary coherent sheaf coefficients, and algebraic geometric proofs of (weighted versions of) the Euler-Maclaurin formulae of Cappell-Shaneson, Brion-Vergne, Guillemin, etc., via the equivariant Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formalism. Our approach, based on motivic characteristic classes, allows us to obtain such Euler-Maclaurin formulae also for (the interior of) a face, or for the polytope with several facets removed. We also prove such results in the weighted context, and for Minkovski summands of the given full-dimensional lattice polytope. Some of these results are extended to local Euler-Maclaurin formulas for the tangent cones at the vertices of the given lattice polytope.

Edge universality of sparse Erdős-Rényi digraphs

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Let $\mathcal A$ be the adjacency matrix of the Erdős-Rényi directed graph $\mathscr G(N,p)$. We denote the eigenvalues of $\mathcal A$ by $\lambda_1^{\cal A},...,\lambda^{\cal A}_N$, and $|\lambda_1^{\cal A}|=\max_i|\lambda_i^{\cal A}|$. For $N^{-1+o(1)}\leq p\leq 1/2$, we show that \[ \max_{i=2,3,...,N} \bigg|\frac{\lambda_i^{\mathcal A}}{\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}\bigg| =1+O(N^{-1/2+o(1)}) \] with very high probability. In addition, we prove that near the unit circle, the local eigenvalue statistics of ${\mathcal A}/\sqrt{Np(1-p)}$ coincide with those of the real Ginibre ensemble. As a by-product, we also show that all non-trivial eigenvectors of $\mathcal A$ are completely delocalized.
For Hermitian random matrices, it is known that the edge statistics are sensitive to the sparsity: in the very sparse regime, one needs to remove many noise random variables (which affect both the mean and the fluctuation) to recover the Tracy-Widom distribution. Our results imply that, compared to their analogues in the Hermitian case, the edge statistics of non-Hermitian sparse random matrices are more robust.

When Deep Learning Meets Polyhedral Theory: A Survey

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
In the past decade, deep learning became the prevalent methodology for predictive modeling thanks to the remarkable accuracy of deep neural networks in tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. Meanwhile, the structure of neural networks converged back to simpler representations based on piecewise constant and piecewise linear functions such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which became the most commonly used type of activation function in neural networks. That made certain types of network structure $\unicode{x2014}$such as the typical fully-connected feedforward neural network$\unicode{x2014}$ amenable to analysis through polyhedral theory and to the application of methodologies such as Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for a variety of purposes. In this paper, we survey the main topics emerging from this fast-paced area of work, which bring a fresh perspective to understanding neural networks in more detail as well as to applying linear optimization techniques to train, verify, and reduce the size of such networks.

Towards sharp regularity: Full-dimensional tori in $ C^\infty $ vector fields over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $
Zhicheng Tong, Yong Li
Comments:
39 pages. Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We consider the $ C^1 $ linearization of a perturbed vector field $ \omega+P $ over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $, and determine the sharp regularity requirement of the perturbation $ P $ conjugating the unperturbed one $ \omega $ onto $ \omega-\tilde{\omega}+P $ via a small modifying term $ \tilde{\omega} $. We discuss the Diophantine type introduced by Bourgain, investigate the universal nonresonance, and provide the weakest known regularity of perturbations for which KAM applies. Our results allow for lower regularity than analyticity such as Gevrey regularity or even $ C^\infty $ regularity. We propose a new KAM scheme with a balancing sequence to overcome the non-polynomial nonresonance, differing from the usual Newtonian approach. Thereby, in addition to deriving the sharp Gevrey exponent along Diophantine nonresonance, we answer the fundamental question of what the minimum regularity required for KAM is in the infinite-dimensional setting: $ C^\infty $ regularity. Our linearization technique also applies to the quasi-periodic case over $ \mathbb{T}^n $.

We present a reachability based approach to establish unique ergodicity of non-linear filter processes where state space of a hidden Markov model is a compact Polish metric space and the observation space is a Polish metric space.

Our conditions, which are explicit, are complementary to those based on filter stability as demonstrated in examples.

Absolute continuity, supports and idempotent splitting in categorical probability

Markov categories have recently turned out to be a powerful high-level framework for probability and statistics. They accommodate purely categorical definitions of notions like conditional probability and almost sure equality, as well as proofs of fundamental results such as the Hewitt--Savage 0/1 Law, the de Finetti Theorem and the Ergodic Decomposition Theorem.
In this work, we develop additional relevant notions from probability theory in the setting of Markov categories. This comprises improved versions of previously introduced definitions of absolute continuity and supports, as well as a detailed study of idempotents and idempotent splitting in Markov categories. Our main result on idempotent splitting is that every idempotent measurable Markov kernel between standard Borel spaces splits through another standard Borel space, and we derive this as an instance of a general categorical criterion for idempotent splitting in Markov categories.

We investigate 3-nondegenerate CR structures in the lowest possible dimension 7 and show that 8 is the maximal dimension for the Lie algebra of symmetries of such structures. The next possible symmetry dimension is 6, and for the automorphism groups the dimension 7 is also realizable. This part (II) is devoted to the case where the symmetry algebra acts intransitively. We use various methods to bound its dimension and demonstrate the existence of infinitely many non-equivalent submaximally symmetric models. Summarizing, we get a stronger form of Beloshapka's conjecture on the symmetry dimension of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$.

We present a new approach to noncommutative stochastic calculus that is, like the classical theory, based primarily on the martingale property. Using this approach, we introduce a general theory of stochastic integration and quadratic (co)variation for a certain class of noncommutative processes, analogous to semimartingales, that includes both the $q$-Brownian motions and classical matrix-valued Brownian motions. As applications, we obtain Burkholder--Davis--Gundy inequalities (with $p \geq 2$) for continuous-time noncommutative martingales and a noncommutative Itô's formula for "adapted $C^2$ maps," including trace $\ast$-polynomial maps and operator functions associated to the noncommutative $C^2$ scalar functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ introduced by Nikitopoulos, as well as the more general multivariate tracial noncommutative $C^2$ functions introduced by Jekel, Li, and Shlyakhtenko.

Parity conditions for one-way rail networks
Dai Akita, Daniel Thorsten Schenz
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
We present parity conditions under which a toy rail network is one-way, i.e., whether a direction can be assigned across the network so that all train journeys are completely consistent with it or completely consistent with its opposite. We show that this problem is equivalent to determining the balance of a signed graph obtained from the network, whose edges are assigned positive or negative signs. Using signed-graph theory, we derive two equivalent parity conditions for one-wayness: (i) every cycle must contain an even number of edges that join the same sides of switches, and (ii) every cycle must contain an even number of angles at switches. Signed-graph theory also offers an analytical criterion: A connected network is one-way if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its signed Laplacian matrix is zero, suggesting a computational tool for evaluating one-wayness.

Upper bounds for the entropy in the cusp for one-parameter diagonal flows on $SL_{d}(\mathbb{R})/SL_{d}(\mathbb{Z})$

Subjects:

We give explicit upper bounds for the entropy in the cusp for one-parameter diagonal flows on $SL_d(\mathbb{R})/SL_{d}(\mathbb{Z})$. These results include bounds for the entropy of the cusp as a whole, as well as for the cusp regions corresponding to either the maximal parabolic subgroups of $SL_{d}$, or the minimal (Borel) parabolic subgroup. To do so, we use a method which involves choosing an auxiliary linear functional on the Lie algebra of the Cartan group, specifically tailored to each of the bounds we are interested in. In a follow-up paper we prove that the upper bounds we obtain in this work are tight.

The main novelty is that, in contrast to previous results, no topological constraints on the crack are required. The results also apply to almost-minimizers.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the Cauchy problem for the stochastic Hartree nonlinear wave equations (SHNLW) with a cubic convolution nonlinearity and an additive stochastic forcing on the Euclidean space. Our goal in this paper is two-fold. (i) We study the defocusing energy-critical SHNLW on $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d \geq 5$, and prove that they are globally well-posed with deterministic initial data in the energy space. (ii) Next, we consider the well-posedness of the defocusing energy-critical SHNLW with randomized initial data below the energy space. In particular, when $d=5$, we prove it is almost surely globally well-posed. As a byproduct, by removing the stochastic forcing our result covers the study of the (deterministic) Hartree nonlinear wave equation (HNLW) with randomized initial data below the energy space.
The main ingredients in the globalization argument involve the probabilistic perturbation approach by Bényi-Oh-Pocovnicu (2015) and Pocovnicu (2017), time integration by parts trick of Oh-Pocovnicu (2016), and an estimate of the Hartree potential energy.

We explore various properties of these frames - particularly their spaciality. We attach a base that constitutes a tree to each non-archimedean frame, and then we observe that every non-archimedean frame is a quotient of the frame of opens of the tree's branch space. Moreover, we give a partial answer to when these frames are canonically isomorphic; this leads to considering some choice principles of the resulting tree.

Operator learning for hyperbolic partial differential equations

Comments:
44 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We construct the first rigorously justified probabilistic algorithm for recovering the solution operator of a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two variables from input-output training pairs. The primary challenge of recovering the solution operator of hyperbolic PDEs is the presence of characteristics, along which the associated Green's function is discontinuous. Therefore, a central component of our algorithm is a rank detection scheme that identifies the approximate location of the characteristics. By combining the randomized singular value decomposition with an adaptive hierarchical partition of the domain, we construct an approximant to the solution operator using $O(\Psi_\epsilon^{-1}\epsilon^{-7}\log(\Xi_\epsilon^{-1}\epsilon^{-1}))$ input-output pairs with relative error $O(\Xi_\epsilon^{-1}\epsilon)$ in the operator norm as $\epsilon\to0$, with high probability. Here, $\Psi_\epsilon$ represents the existence of degenerate singular values of the solution operator, and $\Xi_\epsilon$ measures the quality of the training data. Our assumptions on the regularity of the coefficients of the hyperbolic PDE are relatively weak given that hyperbolic PDEs do not have the ``instantaneous smoothing effect'' of elliptic and parabolic PDEs, and our recovery rate improves as the regularity of the coefficients increases.

In this paper, we introduce a new notion of Koopman operator which faithfully encodes the dynamics of controlled systems by leveraging the tools of set-valued analysis. In this context, we propose generalisations of the Liouville and Perron-Frobenius operators, and show that they respectively coincide with proper set-valued analogues of the infinitesimal generator and dual operator of the Koopman semigroup. We also give meaning to the spectra of these set-valued maps and prove an adapted version of the classical spectral mapping theorem relating the eigenvalues of a semigroup with those of its generator. Our approach provides theoretical justifications for existing practical methods in the Koopman community that study control systems by bundling together the Koopman and Liouville operators associated with different control inputs.

Convergence of the Adapted Smoothed Empirical Measures
Songyan Hou
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
The adapted Wasserstein distance controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the adapted Wasserstein distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures and adapted empirical measures. However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, smoothed empirical measures lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas adapted empirical measures in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures.
In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of smoothed empirical measures. We then introduce a smoothed version for adapted empirical measures, which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as adapted smoothed empirical measures and establish their convergence in mean, deviation, and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.

We consider a strengthening of the usual quasiconvexity condition of Morrey in two dimensions, which allows us to prove lower semicontinuity for functionals which are unbounded as the determinant vanishes. This notion, that we call principal quasiconvexity, arose from the planar theory of quasiconformal mappings and mappings of finite distortion. We compare it with other quasiconvexity conditions that have appeared in the literature and provide a number of concrete examples of principally quasiconvex functionals that are not polyconvex. The Stoilow factorization, that in the context of maps of integrable distortion was developed by Iwaniec and Šverák, plays a prominent role in our approach.

We state combinatorial formulas for hyperoctahedral group ($\mathfrak B_n$) character evaluations of the form $\chi( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$, where ${{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1) \in \Bbb Z[\mathfrak B_n]$ is a type-BC Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element, with $w \in \mathfrak B_n$ corresponding to simultaneously smooth type-B and C Schubert varieties. We also extend the definition of symmetric group codominance to elements of $\mathfrak B_n$ and show that for each element $w \in \mathfrak B_n$ above, there exists a BC-codominant element $v \in \mathfrak B_n$ satisfying $\chi( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1)) = \chi( {{\widetilde C}_v}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$ for all $\mathfrak B_n$-characters $\chi$. Combinatorial structures and maps appearing in these formulas are type-BC extensions of planar networks, unit interval orders, indifference graphs, poset tableaux, and colorings. Using the ring of type-BC symmetric functions, we introduce natural generating functions $Y( {{\widetilde C}_w}^{\negthickspace\negthickspace BC}\negthickspace(1))$ for the above evaluations. These provide a new type-BC analog of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions [Adv. Math. 111 (1995) pp. 166-194].

This proves a relative version of the main result of arXiv:2206.14914. The assumption of control on the perturbation of parabolics is necessary.

In this paper we prove a strong version of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz in the ring $\mathbb H[q_1,\ldots,q_n]$ of slice regular polynomials in several quaternionic variables. Our proof deeply depends on a detailed analysis of the common zeros of slice regular polynomials which belong to an ideal in $\mathbb H[q_1,\ldots,q_n]$. This study motivates the introduction of a new notion of algebraic set in the quaternionic setting, which allows us to define a Zariski-type topology on $\mathbb H^n$.

We study $F$-gauges for de Rham cohomology of smooth algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. Applying to good reductions of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we recover the Ekedahl-Oort stratifications by constructing universal de Rham $F$-gauges with $G$-structure. We also study the cohomology of de Rham $F$-gauges on these varieties. In particular, in the PEL type case and when the weights of the flat automorphic vector bundles are $p$-small, we determine the $F$-gauge structure on their de Rham cohomology by the associated dual BGG complexes.

Sticky-threshold diffusions, local time approximation and parameter estimation
Alexis Anagnostakis, Sara Mazzonetto
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study a class of high-frequency path functionals for diffusions with singular thresholds or boundaries, where the process exhibits either (i) skweness, oscillating coefficients, and stickiness, or (ii) sticky reflection. The functionals are constructed from a test function and a diverging normalizing sequence. We establish convergence to local time, generalizing existing results for these processes.
Notably, our framework allows for any normalizing sequence diverging slower than the observation frequency and for thresholds that are jointly skew-oscillating-sticky (thresholds where stickiness, oscillations, and skewness occur). Combining our results with occupation time approximations, we develop consistent estimators for stickiness and skewness parameters at thresholds that exhibit any combination of these features (stickiness, oscillation, skewness, and reflection).

We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the concept of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result can be reduced to the unimodularity of the tensor product of two maximal circuits (here we call a vector system a maximal circuit, if it can be expressed as $B \cup \{ -\sum B \}$ with some basis $B$).

Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Probability (math.PR)
We adapt Stein's method to obtain Berry--Esseen type error bounds in the multivariate central limit theorem for non-stationary processes generated by time-dependent compositions of uniformly expanding dynamical systems. In a particular case of random dynamical systems with a strongly mixing base transformation, we derive an error estimate of order $O(N^{-1/2})$ in the quenched multivariate CLT, provided that the covariance matrix "grows linearly" with the number of summands $N$. The error in the normal approximation is estimated for the class of all convex sets.

Title:
An existence and uniqueness result to evolution equations with sign-changing pseudo-differential operators and its applications to logarithmic Laplacian operators and second-order differential operators without ellipticity

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
We broaden the domain of the Fourier transform to contain all distributions without using the Paley-Wiener theorem and devise a new weak formulation built upon this extension. This formulation is applicable to evolution equations involving pseudo-differential operators, even when the signs of their symbols may vary over time. Notably, our main operator includes the logarithmic Laplacian operator $\log (-\Delta)$ and a second-order differential operator whose leading coefficients are not positive semi-definite.

Locally algebraic representations and integral structures on the cohomology of arithmetic groups
Fabian Januszewski
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
This paper introduces the notion of locally algebraic representations and corresponding sheaves in the context of the cohomology of arithmetic groups. These representations are of relevance for the study of integral structures and special values of cohomological automorphic representations, as well as corresponding period relations. We introduce and investigate related concepts such as locally algebraic $({\mathfrak g},K)$-modules and cohomological types of automorphic representations. Applying the recently developed theory of tdos and twisted $\mathcal D$-modules over schemes by Hayashi and the author, we establish the existence of canonical global $1/N$-integral structures on spaces of automorphic cusp forms. As an application, we define canonical periods attached to regular algebraic automorphic representations, potentially related to the action of Venkatesh's derived Hecke algebra on cuspidal cohomology.

We axiomatize the first-order theories of exponential integer parts of real-closed exponential fields in a language with $2^x$, in a language with a predicate for powers of 2, and in the basic language of ordered rings. In particular, the last theory extends IOpen by sentences expressing the existence of winning strategies in a certain game on integers; we show that it is a proper extension of IOpen, and give upper and lower bounds on the required number of rounds needed to win the game.

Title:
Development of discontinuous Galerkin methods for hyperbolic systems that preserve a curl or a divergence constraint: the case of linear systems
Vincent Perrier (CAGIRE, LMAP)
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Some hyperbolic systems are known to include implicit preservation of differential constraints: these are for example the time conservation of the curl or the divergence of a vector that appear as an implicit constraint. In this article, we show that this kind of constraint can be easily conserved at the discrete level with the classical discontinuous Galerkin method, provided the right approximation space is used for the vectorial space, and under some mild assumption on the numerical flux. For this, we recall a discrete de-Rham framework in which discontinuous approximation spaces for vectors fits. The discrete adjoint divergence and curl are proven to be exactly preserved by the discontinuous Galerkin method under a small assumption on the numerical flux. Numerical tests are performed on the wave system, the two dimensional Maxwell system and the induction equation, and confirm that the differential constraints are preserved at machine precision while keeping the high order of accuracy.

Convergence of Random Products of Countably Infinitely Many Projections

Let $r \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ be a fixed number and let $P_j\,\, (1 \leq j\leq r )$ be the projection onto the closed subspace $\mathcal{M}_j$ of $\mathscr{H}$. We are interested in studying the sequence $P_{i_1}, P_{i_2}, \ldots \in\{P_1, \ldots, P_r\}$. A significant problem is to demonstrate conditions under which the sequence $\{P_{i_n}\cdots P_{i_2}P_{i_1}x\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges strongly or weakly to $Px$ for any $x\in\mathscr{H}$, where $P$ is the projection onto the intersection $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_1\cap \ldots \cap \mathcal{M}_r$. Several mathematicians have presented their insights on this matter since von Neumann established his result in the case of $r=2$. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to a question posed by M. Sakai. We present a result concerning random products of countably infinitely many projections (the case $r=\infty$) incorporating the notion of pseudo-periodic function.

Analysis of the SQP Method for Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion
Luis Ammann, Irwin Yousept
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, the SQP method applied to a hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem is considered. The model arises from the acoustic full waveform inversion in the time domain. The analysis is mainly challenging due to the involved hyperbolicity and second-order bilinear structure. This notorious character leads to an undesired effect of loss of regularity in the SQP method, calling for a substantial extension of developed parabolic techniques. We propose and analyze a novel strategy for the well-posedness and convergence analysis based on the use of a smooth-in-time initial condition, a tailored self-mapping operator, and a two-step estimation process along with Stampacchia's method for second-order wave equations. Our final theoretical result is the R-superlinear convergence of the SQP method.

Title:
Newsvendor under Ambiguity and Misspecification
Feng Liu, Zhi Chen, Ruodu Wang, Shuming Wang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Problem definition: We consider a newsvendor problem with unknown demand distribution, where we distinguish ambiguity under which the newsvendor does not differentiate demand distributions of common characteristics and misspecification under which such characteristics might be misspecified.
Methodology/results: The newsvendor hedges against ambiguity and misspecification by maximizing the worst-case expected profit regularized by a distribution's distance to an ambiguity set. Focusing on the popular mean-variance ambiguity set and optimal-transport cost for the misspecification, we show that the decision criterion of misspecification aversion possesses insightful interpretations as distributional transforms. We derive the closed-form optimal order quantity that generalizes the solution of the Scarf model under only ambiguity aversion. We establish the finite-sample performance guarantee, which consists of two parts: in-sample optimal value and out-of-sample effect of misspecification that can be further decoupled into estimation error and distribution shift. We also extend the framework to multiple products, distributional characteristics specified via optimal transport, and misspecification measured by total variation distance.
Managerial implications: The closed-form solution highlights the impact of misspecification aversion: the optimal order quantity under misspecification aversion can decrease as the price or variance increases, reversing the monotonicity of that under only ambiguity aversion. Hence, ambiguity and misspecification, as different layers of distributional uncertainty, can result in distinct operational consequences. The finite-sample performance guarantee theoretically justifies the necessity of incorporating misspecification aversion in a non-stationary environment, which is also well demonstrated in our experiments with real-world data.

Title:
A constraint-based approach to function interpolation, with application to performance estimation for weakly convex optimisation
Anne Rubbens, Julien M. Hendrickx
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We consider the problem of obtaining interpolation constraints for function classes, i.e., necessary and sufficient constraints that a set of points, function values and (sub)gradients must satisfy to ensure the existence of a global function of the class considered, consistent with this set. The derivation of such constraints is crucial, e.g., in the performance analysis of optimization methods, since obtaining a priori tight performance guarantees requires using a tight description of function classes of interest. We propose an approach that allows setting aside all analytic properties of the function class to work only at an algebraic level, and to obtain counterexamples when a condition characterizing a function class cannot serve as an interpolation constraint. As an illustration, we provide interpolation constraints for the class of weakly convex functions with bounded subgradients, and rely on these constraints to outperform state-of-the-art bounds on the performance of the subgradient method on this class.

Subjects:

We investigate Wiener's Tauberian theorem from the perspective of limit functions, which results in several new versions of the Tauberian theorem. Based on this, we formulate and prove analogous Tauberian theorems for operators in the sense of quantum harmonic analysis. Using these results, we characterize the class of slowly oscillating operators and show that this class is strictly larger than the class of compact operators. Finally, we discuss uniform versions of Wiener's Tauberian theorem and its operator analogue and provide an application of this in operator theory.

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou in that case.

Furthermore, we provide a simple proof of automatic continuity in the context of homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and a complete reworking of automatic continuity theory in the context of isometry groups of highly homogeneous complete metric structures.

Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.

A tactical time slot management problem under mixed logit demand

Subjects:

We study the tactical time slot management problem under mixed logit demand for attended home delivery in subscription settings. We propose a static mixed-integer linear programming model that integrates delivery slot assortment, price discount decisions, and routing optimization while capturing customer heterogeneity through the mixed logit model. To overcome the computational challenges posed by simulation-based choice probabilities, we develop a simulation-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search method aligned with a Sample Average Approximation reformulation. Computational experiments on large-scale instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing stochastic customer behavior and preference heterogeneity, providing a scalable and flexible method for optimizing time slot management under complex demand structures.

Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
We study the structure of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$, the category of finite sets and all maps, mostly working over a field of characteristic zero. This category is not semi-simple and exhibits interesting features.
We first construct the simple representations, recovering the classification given by Wiltshire-Gordon. The construction given here also yields explicit descriptions of the indecomposable projectives.
These results are used to give a convenient set of projective generators of the category of representations of $\mathbf{FA}$ and hence a Morita equivalence result. This is used to explain how to calculate the multiplicities of the composition factors of an arbitrary object, based only on its underlying $\mathbf{FB}$-representation, where $\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite sets and bijections.
This is applied to show how to calculate the morphism spaces between projectives in our chosen set of generators, as well as for a closely related family of objects (the significance of which can be shown by relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory).

This paper examines the impact of discrete marginal distributions on copula-based Markov chains. We present results on mixing and parameter estimation for a copula-based Markov chain model with Bernoulli($p$) marginal distribution and highlight the differences between continuous and discrete state-space Markov chains. We derive estimators for model parameters using the maximum likelihood approach and discuss other estimators of $p$ that are asymptotically equivalent to its maximum likelihood estimator. The asymptotic distributions of the parameter estimators are provided. A simulation study showcases the performance of the different estimators of $p$. Additionally, statistical tests for model parameters are included.

The multivariate fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Methodology (stat.ME)
Starting from the notion of multivariate fractional Brownian Motion introduced in [F. Lavancier, A. Philippe, and D. Surgailis. Covariance function of vector self-similar processes. Statistics & Probability Letters, 2009] we define a multivariate version of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This multivariate Gaussian process is stationary, ergodic and allows for different Hurst exponents on each component. We characterize its correlation matrix and its short and long time asymptotics. Besides the marginal parameters, the cross correlation between one-dimensional marginal components is ruled by two parameters. We consider the problem of their inference, proposing two types of estimator, constructed from discrete observations of the process. We establish their asymptotic theory, in one case in the long time asymptotic setting, in the other case in the infill and long time asymptotic setting. The limit behavior can be asymptotically Gaussian or non-Gaussian, depending on the values of the Hurst exponents of the marginal components. The technical core of the paper relies on the analysis of asymptotic properties of functionals of Gaussian processes, that we establish using Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. We provide numerical experiments that support our theoretical analysis and also suggest a conjecture on the application of one of these estimators to the multivariate fractional Brownian Motion.

We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.

Does $20$ have a friend? Or is it a solitary number? A folklore conjecture asserts that $20$ has no friends i.e. it is a solitary number. In this article, we prove that, a friend $N$ of $20$ is of the form $N=2\cdot5^{2a}\cdot m^2$, with $(3,m)=(7,m)=1$ and it has at least six distinct prime divisors. Furthermore, we show that $\Omega(N)\geq 2\omega(N)+6a-5$ and if $\Omega(m)\leq K$ then $N< 10\cdot 6^{(2^{K-2a+3}-1)^2}$, where $\Omega(n)$ and $\omega(n)$ denote the total number of prime divisors and the number of distinct prime divisors of the integer $n$ respectively. In addition, we deduce that, not all exponents of odd prime divisors of friend $N$ of $20$ are congruent to $-1$ modulo $f$, where $f$ is the order of $5$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$ such that $3\mid f$ and $p$ is a prime congruent to $1$ modulo $6$. Also, we prove necessary upper bounds for all prime divisors of friends of 20 in terms of the number of divisors of the friend. In addition, we prove that, if $P$ is the largest prime divisor of $N$ then $P<N^{\frac{1}{4}}$.

We employ our product theorem to distinguish up to quasiisometry certain families among these groups which share the same dimension, cone-dimension and Dehn function; actually we do this by distinguishing them up to sublinear bilipschitz equivalence, which is slightly stronger. Especially, we recover the fact, recently obtained by Bourdon and Rémy with different groups, that there exists uncountably many quasiisometry classes of indecomposable, non-unimodular, higher rank solvable Lie groups.

Subjects:

Let $J_{1,m}(N)$ be the vector space of Jacobi forms of weight one and index $m$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$. In 1985, Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(1)=0$ for all $m$. In 2007, Ibukiyama and Skoruppa proved that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ and all squarefree $N$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. This paper aims to extend their results. We determine all levels $N$ separately, such that $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$; or $J_{1,m}(N)=0$ for all $m$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(m,N)=1$. We also establish explicit dimension formulas of $J_{1,m}(N)$ when $m$ and $N$ are relatively prime or $m$ is squarefree. These results are obtained by refining Skoruppa's method and analyzing local invariants of Weil representations. As applications, we prove the vanishing of Siegel modular forms of degree two and weight one in some cases.

We present an optimization algorithm that can identify a global minimum of a potentially nonconvex smooth function with high probability, assuming the Gibbs measure of the potential satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. Our contribution is twofold: on the one hand we propose a global optimization method, which is built on an oracle sampling algorithm producing arbitrarily accurate samples from a given Gibbs measure. On the other hand, we propose a new sampling algorithm, drawing inspiration from both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics, as well as from the high-resolution differential equation known for its acceleration in deterministic settings. While the focus of the paper is primarily theoretical, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on the Rastrigin function, where it outperforms recent approaches.

Starting with a smooth, non-trivial $n$-dimensional knot $K\subset\bS^{n+2}$, and a beaded $n$-dimensional necklace subordinated to $K$, we construct a wild knot with a Cantor set of wild points (\ie the knot is not locally flat in these points). The construction uses the conformal Schottky group acting on $\bS^{n+2}$, generated by inversions on the spheres which are the boundary of the ``beads''. We show that if $K$ is a fibered knot, then the wild knot is also fibered. We also study cyclic branched coverings along the wild knots. This work generalizes the result presented in [8].

Composing Optimized Stepsize Schedules for Gradient Descent
Benjamin Grimmer, Kevin Shu, Alex L. Wang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Recent works by Altschuler and Parrilo and the authors have shown that it is possible to accelerate the convergence of gradient descent on smooth convex functions, even without momentum, just by picking special stepsizes. In this paper, we provide a general theory for composing stepsize schedules capturing all recent advances in this area and more. We propose three notions of ``composable'' stepsize schedules with elementary associated composition operations for combining them. From these operations, in addition to recovering recent works, we construct three highly optimized sequences of stepsize schedules. We first construct optimized stepsize schedules of every length generalizing the exponentially spaced silver stepsizes. We then construct highly optimized stepsizes schedules for minimizing final objective gap or gradient norm, improving on prior rates by constants and, more importantly, matching or beating the numerically computed minimax optimal schedules. We conjecture these schedules are in fact minimax (information theoretic) optimal. Several novel tertiary results follow from our theory including recovery of the recent dynamic gradient norm minimizing short stepsizes and extending them to objective gap minimization.

This work is concerned with the large deviation principle for a family of slow-fast systems perturbed by infinite-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(\frac12,1)$. We adopt the weak convergence method which is based on the variational representation formula for infinite-dimensional mixed fractional Brownian motion. To obtain the weak convergence of the controlled systems, we apply the Khasminskii's averaging principle and the time discretization technique. In addition, we drop the boundedness assumption of the drift coefficients of the slow components and the diffusion coefficients of the fast this http URL on the proof of the large deviation principle, we also establish the moderate deviation principle for the slow-fast systems.

We introduce a novel family of time-varying step-sizes for the classical projected subgradient method, offering optimal ergodic convergence. Importantly, this approach does not depend on the Lipschitz assumption of the objective function, thereby broadening the convergence result of projected subgradient method to non-Lipschitz case.

Winding Number Statistics for Chiral Random Matrices: Universal Correlations and Statistical Moments in the Unitary Case
Nico Hahn, Mario Kieburg, Omri Gat, Thomas Guhr
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)
The winding number is the topological invariant that classifies chiral symmetric Hamiltonians with one-dimensional parametric dependence. In this work we complete our study of the winding number statistics in a random matrix model belonging to the chiral unitary class AIII. We show that in the limit of large matrix dimensions the winding number distribution becomes Gaussian. Our results include expressions for the statistical moments of the winding number and for the k-point correlation function of the winding number density.

Infinite stationary measures of co-compact group actions

Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group, and let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate, finitely supported probability measure on $\Gamma$. We show that every co-compact $\Gamma$ action on a locally compact Hausdorff space admits a nonzero $\mu$-stationary Radon measure. The main ingredient of the proof is a stationary analogue of Tarski's theorem: we show that for every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \Gamma$ there is a $\mu$-stationary, finitely additive measure on $\Gamma$ that assigns unit mass to $A$.

Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate a class of line ensembles whose local structure is described by independent geometric random walk bridges, which have been conditioned to interlace with each other. The latter arise naturally in the context Schur processes, including their versions in a half-space and a finite interval with free or periodic boundary conditions. We show that under one-point tightness of the curves, these line ensembles are tight and any subsequential limit satisfies the Brownian Gibbs property. As an application of our tightness results, we show that sequences of spiked Schur processes, that were recently considered in arXiv:2408.08445, converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles.

Under some technical assumptions, and building on joint work with Bezrukavnikov, we prove a multiplicity formula for indecomposable tilting perverse sheaves on affine flag varieties, with coefficients in a field of characteristic $p$, in terms of $p$-Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials. Under the same assumptions, we also explain the construction of a "degrading functor" relating mixed modular perverse sheaves (as defined in joint work with Achar) on such varieties to ordinary perverse sheaves.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we investigate the critical behavior of solutions to the semilinear biharmonic heat equation with forcing term $f(x),$ under six homogeneous boundary conditions. This paper is the first since the seminal work by Bandle, Levine, and Zhang [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 251 (2000) 624-648], to focus on the study of critical exponents in exterior problems for semilinear parabolic equations with a forcing term. By employing a method of test functions and comparison principle, we derive the critical exponents $p_{Crit}$ in the sense of Fujita. Moreover, we show that $p_{Crit}=\infty$ if $N=2,3,4$ and $p_{Crit}=\frac{N}{N-4}$ if $N \geq 5$. The impact of the forcing term on the critical behavior of the problem is also of interest, and thus a second critical exponent in the sense of Lee-Ni, depending on the forcing term is introduced. We also discuss the case $f\equiv 0$, and present the finite-time blow-up results and lifespan estimates of solutions for the subcritical and critical cases. The lifespan estimates of solutions are obtained by employing the method proposed by Ikeda and Sobajama in [Nonlinear Anal. 182 (2019) 57-74].

Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions
Paweł Pietrzycki, Jan Stochel
Subjects:
Operator Algebras (math.OA); Functional Analysis (math.FA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.

Multiuser Commitment over Noisy Channels

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)
We consider multi-user commitment models that capture the problem of enabling multiple bidders to simultaneously submit auctions to verifiers while ensuring that i) verifiers do not obtain information on the auctions until bidders reveal them at a later stage; and, ii) bidders cannot change their auction once committed. Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.

Suboptimal MPC with a Computation Governor: Stability, Recursive Feasibility, and Applications to ADMM
Steven van Leeuwen, Ilya Kolmanovsky
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The paper considers a computational governor strategy to facilitate the implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on inexact optimization when the time available to compute the solution may be insufficient. In the setting of linear-quadratic MPC and a class of optimizers that includes Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we derive conditions on the reference command adjustment by the computational governor and on a constraint tightening strategy which ensure recursive feasibility, convergence of the modified reference command, and closed-loop stability. An online procedure to select the modified reference command and construct an implicit terminal set is also proposed. A simulation example is reported which illustrates the developed procedures.

On the well-posedness of SPDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients
Mohammud Foondun, Davar Khoshnevisan, Eulalia Nualart
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We consider the stochastic partial differential equation, $\partial_t u = \tfrac12 \partial^2_x u + b(u) + \sigma(u) \dot{W},$ where $u=u(t\,,x)$ is defined for $(t\,,x)\in(0\,,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}$, and $\dot{W}$ denotes space-time white noise. We prove that this SPDE is well posed solely under the assumptions that the initial condition $u(0)$ is bounded and measurable, and $b$ and $\sigma$ are locally Lipschitz continuous functions and have at most linear growth. Our method is based on a truncation argument together with moment bounds and tail estimates of the truncated solution. The results naturally generalize to the case where $b$ and $\sigma$ are time dependent with uniform-in-time growth and oscillation properties. Additionally, our method can be extended to the stochastic wave equation.

This is done by showing that almost all results still hold true over $k$ via the same argument or by using étale base arguments and then use a lift with the Comparison theorems [22, Theorems 21.1 & 20.5] as needed.

Moreover, $B$ splits over the Galois closure of the CM field associated with $A$.

We also show that if the underlying manifold does not admit Kähler-Einstein metric, then the flow develops Nadel multiplier ideal sheaves. In addition, we establish the linear lower bound for $\inf_X\varphi$, and the theorem of Darvas and He for the inverse Monge-Ampere flow.

Subjects:

We establish general quantitative conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive Wiener noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated exponentially ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Furthermore, we provide quantitative upper bounds for the Wasserstein $\varepsilon$-mixing times. Examples on possibly unbounded domains include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.

Low$_2$ computably enumerable sets have hyperhypersimple supersets

Logic (math.LO)
A longstanding question is to characterize the lattice of supersets (modulo finite sets), $\mathcal{L}^*(A)$, of a low$_2$ computably enumerable (c.e.) set. The conjecture is that $\mathcal{L}^*(A)\cong {\mathcal E}^*$. In spite of claims in the literature, this longstanding question/conjecture remains open. We contribute to this problem by solving one of the main test cases. We show that if c.e.\ $A$ is low$_2$ then $A$ has an atomless hyperhypersimple superset. In fact, if $A$ is c.e.\ and low$_2$, then for any $\Sigma_3$-Boolean algebra~$B$ there is some c.e.\ $H\supseteq A$ such that $\mathcal{L}^*(H)\cong B$.

Randomized LU-Householder CholeskyQR

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we develop randomized LU-Householder CholeskyQR (rLHC) for QR factorization of the tall-skinny matrices, consisting of SLHC3 with single-sketching and SSLHC3 with multi-sketching. Similar to LU-CholeskyQR2 (LUC2), they do not require a condition of $\kappa_{2}(X)$ for the input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, which ensures the applicability of the algorithms and is distinguished from many CholeskyQR-type algorithms. To address the issue of numerical breakdown of LUC2 when the $L$-factor from LU factorization is ill-conditioned, we employ HouseholderQR to generate the upper-triangular factor alternatively together the latest matrix sketching to guarantee the efficiency. We provide rounding error analysis of our new algorithms and show their numerical stability. Numerical experiments demonstrate the better applicability of SLHC3 and SSLHC3 compared to the existing algorithms while maintaining good accuracy and robustness. Regarding efficiency, SLHC3 and SSLHC3 are at the similar level as that of LUC2. When $m=\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ for $X$, SSLHC3 with multi-sketching is more efficient than SLHC3 with single-sketching. SLHC3 and SSLHC3 balance the applicability, efficiency, accuracy and robustness, becoming outstanding algorithms for QR factorization.

Through the establishment of several extension theorems, we provide explicit expressions for all contractive projections and 1-complemented subspaces in the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ for $1\leq p<\infty$, $p\neq 2$. Our characterization leads to two corollaries: first, all nontrivial 1-complemented subspaces of $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ are isometric to $H^p(\mathbb{T})$; second, all contractive projections on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ are restrictions of contractive projections on $L^p(\mathbb{T})$ that leave $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ invariant. The first corollary provides examples of prime Banach spaces \emph{in the isometric sense}, while the second answers a question posed by P. Wojtaszczyk in 2003.

Optimizing over iid distributions and the Beat the Average game

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
A casino offers the following game. There are three cups each containing a die. You are being told that the dice in the cups are all the same, but possibly nonstandard. For a bet of \$1, the game master shakes all three cups and lets you choose one of them. You win \$2 if the die in your cup displays at least the average of the other two, and you lose otherwise. Is this game in your favor? If not, how should the casino design the dice to maximize their profit?
This problem is a special case of the following more general question: given a measurable space $X$ and a bounded measurable function $f : X^n \to \R$, how large can the expectation of $f$ under probability measures of the form $\mu^{\otimes n}$ be? We develop a general method to answer this kind of question. As an example application that is harder than the casino problem, we show that the maximal probability of the event $X_1 + X_2 + X_3 < 2 X_4$ for nonnegative iid random variables lies between $0.400695$ and $0.417$, where the upper bound is obtained by mixed integer linear programming. We conjecture the lower bound to be the exact value.

MCMC-Net: Accelerating Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Neural Networks for Inverse Problems

Comments:
41 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In many computational problems, using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be prohibitively time-consuming. We propose MCMC-Net, a simple yet efficient way to accelerate MCMC via neural networks. The key idea of our approach is to substitute the true likelihood function of the MCMC method with a neural operator based surrogate. We extensively evaluate the accuracy and speedup of our method on three different PDE-based inverse problems where likelihood computations are computationally expensive, namely electrical impedance tomography, diffuse optical tomography, and quantitative photoacoustic tomography.
MCMC-Net performs similar to the classical likelihood counterpart but with a significant speedup. We conjecture that the method can be applied to any problem with a sufficiently expensive likelihood function. We also analyze MCMC-Net in a theoretical setting for the different use cases. We prove a universal approximation theorem-type result to show that the proposed network can approximate the mapping resulting from forward model evaluations to a desired accuracy. Furthermore, we establish convergence of the surrogate posterior to the true posterior under Hellinger distance.

Semistrong edge colorings of planar graphs
Yuquan Lin, Wensong Lin
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Strengthened notions of a matching $M$ of a graph $G$ have been considered, requiring that the matching $M$ has some properties with respect to the subgraph $G_M$ of $G$ induced by the vertices covered by $M$: If $M$ is the unique perfect matching of $G_M$, then $M$ is a \emph{uniquely restricted matching} of $G$; if all the edges of $M$ are pendant edges of $G_M$, then $M$ is a \emph{semistrong matching} of $G$; if all the vertices of $G_M$ are pendant, then $M$ is an \emph{induced matching} of $G$. Strengthened notions of edge coloring and of the chromatic index follow.
In this paper, we consider the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with given maximum degree $\Delta$. We prove that graphs with maximum average degree less than ${14}/{5}$ have semistrong chromatic index (hence uniquely restricted chromatic index) at most $2\Delta+4$, and we reduce the bound to $2\Delta+2$ if the maximum average degree is less than ${8}/{3}$. These cases cover, in particular, the cases of planar graphs with girth at least 7 (resp. at least 8).
Our result makes some progress on the conjecture of Lu{ž}ar, Mockov{č}iakov{á} and Sot{á}k [J.~Graph Theory 105 (2024) 612--632], which asserts that every planar graph $G$ has a semistrong edge coloring with $2\Delta+C$ colors, for some universal constant $C$. (Note that such a conjecture would fail for strong edge coloring as there exist graphs with arbitrarily large maximum degree that are not strongly $(4\Delta-5)$-edge-colorable.) We provide an example of a planar graph showing that the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ is at least $2\Delta+4$.

The Chromatic Tiling Theorem: Scaling Laws and the Separation Dimension of Fractal Partitions
Robin Jackson
Comments:
7 Pages, 3 Figures
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
This paper establishes a rigorous, quantitative link between the combinatorial complexity of a fractal partition and the intrinsic geometry of its interfaces. We introduce the concept of the \emph{Separation Dimension} ($\sepdim$), a novel characteristic that quantifies the Hausdorff dimension of the boundaries between tiles. A natural but flawed approach would be to relate coloring complexity to the fractal's ambient topological boundary. We demonstrate that this extrinsic view is untenable for a vast class of self-similar sets. Instead, our intrinsic framework, centered on the Separation Dimension, provides the correct formulation. We define a new class of well-behaved partitions, termed \emph{Geometrically Regular Partitions (GRPs)}, and prove their existence on canonical fractals such as the Sierpinski Carpet. Our main result, the Chromatic Tiling Theorem, provides a sharp upper bound for the chromatic number ($\chi$) of the graph associated with such a partition, proving that it is bounded by $\chi(\tiling) \leq \Cconst (r_{\max}/r_{\min})^{\sepdim}$. This result demonstrates that the scaling of coloring complexity is governed not by the dimension of the fractal itself, but by the dimension of the separation set induced by the partition. We conclude by proposing the minimization of the separation dimension over all admissible partitions as a new variational problem in fractal geometry.

However, the endpoint case estimates for the critical exponent $s=s_c(q,d)$ have remained open so far. We obtain the endpoint $H^{s_c(q,d)}$--$L^q$ bounds on the maximal operator $f\mapsto \sup_{t} |e^{ it\sqrt{-\Delta}}f|$. We also prove that several different forms of the maximal estimates considered by Rogers--Villarroya are basically equivalent to each other.

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In this paper, we study a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system employing a full-duplex base station with sensing capabilities against a mobile proactive adversarial target$\unicode{x2014}$a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (M-UAV). We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.

Using the correspondence between solutions to the SU(n+1) Toda system on a Riemann surface and totally unramified unitary curves, we show that a spherical metric $\omega$ generates a family of solutions, including $(i(n+1-i)\omega)_{i=1}^n$. Moreover, we characterize this family in terms of the monodromy group of the spherical metric. As a consequence, we obtain a new solution class to the SU(n+1) Toda system with cone singularities on compact Riemann surfaces, complementing the existence results of Lin-Yang-Zhong (JDG, 114(2):337-391, 2020).

Reconstruction of 1-D evolution equations and their initial data from one passive measurement
Ali Feizmohammadi
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a one-dimensional model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schrödinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two ingredients, namely (i) a Paley-Wiener type theorem for Schrödinger operators due to Remling \cite{Remling2002SchrdingerOA} and a theorem of Levinson \cite{Levinson1940} on distribution of zeros of entire functions of regular growth that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schrödinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon \cite{Gesztesy1999InverseSA} on partial data inverse spectral problems for reconstructing an unknown potential in a 1D Schrödinger operator from the knowledge of only a fraction of its spectrum.

Degenerate elliptic equations with $Φ$-admissible weights
Lyudmila Korobenko
Comments:
some typos fixed
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We develop regularity theory for degenerate elliptic equations with the degeneracy controlled by a weight. More precisely, we show local boundedness and continuity of weak solutions under the assumption of a weighted Orlicz-Sobolev and Poincaré inequalities. The proof relies on a modified DeGiorgi iteration scheme, developed in arXiv:1608.01630 and arXiv:1703.00774. The Orlicz-Sobolev inequality we assume here is much weaker than the classical $(2\sigma,2)$ Sobolev inequality with $\sigma>1$ which is typically used in the DeGiorgi or Moser iteration.

Constructing reducibly geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group

Geometric Topology (math.GT); Group Theory (math.GR)
In this article, we consider qualified notions of geometric finiteness in mapping class groups called parabolically geometrically finite (PGF) and reducibly geometrically finite (RGF). We examine several constructions of subgroups and determine when they produce a PGF or RGF subgroup. These results provide a variety of new examples of PGF and RGF subgroups. Firstly, we consider the right-angled Artin subgroups constructed by Koberda and Clay--Leininger--Mangahas, which are generated by high powers of given elements of the mapping class group. We give conditions on the supports of these elements that imply the resulting right-angled Artin subgroup is RGF. Secondly, we prove combination theorems which provide conditions for when a collection of reducible subgroups, or sufficiently deep finite-index subgroups thereof, generate an RGF subgroup.

Haile Gilroy
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In mathematics education research, mathematics task sets involving mixed practice include tasks from many different topics within the same assignment. In this paper, we use graph decompositions to construct mixed practice task sets for Calculus I, focusing on derivative computation tasks, or tasks of the form "Compute $f'(x)$ of the function $f(x)=$ [elementary function]." A decomposition $D$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a collection $\{H_1, H_2, ... , H_t\}$ of nonempty subgraphs such that $H_i=G[E_i]$ for some nonempty subset $E_i$ of $E(G)$, and $\{E_1, E_2, ... , E_t\}$ is a partition of $E(G)$. We extend results on decompositions of the complete directed graph due to Meszka and Skupień to construct balanced task sets that assess the Chain Rule.

A semibrick is a set of modules satisfying Schur's Lemma, and it is said to be maximal if it is not properly contained in another semibrick. For any finite dimensional algebra $\varLambda$ over an algebracally closed field $K$, we prove that any maximal finite semibrick $\mathcal{S}$ consists only of open bricks $B$, that is, bricks whose orbit closures $\overline{\mathcal{O}_B}$ are irreducible components in the representation schemes.

Subjects:

This work studies conditions under which integral transforms induce exact functors on singularity categories between schemes that are proper over a Noetherian base scheme. A complete characterization for this behavior is provided, which extends earlier work of Ballard and Rizzardo. We leverage a description of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves as finite cohomological functors on the category of perfect complexes, which is an application of Neeman's approximable triangulated categories, to reduce arguments to an affine local setting. Moreover, we study adjoints of such functors, extend a result of Olander to varieties with mild singularities, and provide an obstruction for derived equivalences between singular varieties.

In this work, we characterize matrices of linear forms and constant rank, demonstrating that, under some natural assumptions, they are always associated with a syzygy bundle that fits into a (partially linear) resolution. Furthermore, this construction allows us to list all indecomposable matrices of constant rank up to 7, as well as describing the moduli spaces of simple vector bundles naturally defined by families of constant rank matrices.

We compute the Čech homotopy groups of the $m$-dimensional infinite earring space $\mathbb{E}_m$, i.e. a shrinking wedge of $m$-spheres. In particular, for all $n,m\geq 2$, we prove that $\check{\pi}_n(\mathbb{E}_m)$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of countable powers of homotopy groups of spheres: $\bigoplus_{1\leq j\leq \frac{n-1}{m-1}}\left(\pi_{n}(S^{mj-j+1})\right)^{\mathbb{N}}$. Equipped with this isomorphism and infinite-sum algebra, we also construct new elements of $\pi_n(\mathbb{E}_m)$ with a view toward characterizing the image of the canonical homomorphism $\Psi_{n}:\pi_n(\mathbb{E}_m)\to \check{\pi}_{n}(\mathbb{E}_m)$. We prove that $\Psi_{n}$ is a split epimorphism when $n\leq 2m-1$ and we identify a candidate for the image of $\Psi_n$ when $n>2m-1$.

Let $F$ be a field of prime order $p$ and let $\bar{F}$ denote an algebraic closure of $F$. Then for any finite group $G$ we obtain a well-defined surjective map $\Gamma$ from the set of finitely generated isomorphism types of indecomposable $\bar{F}G$-modules, $(\text{ITI}(\bar{F}G))$ to the corresponding set of $FG$-modules $(\text{ITI}(FG))$ such that if $X$ is a finitely generated indecomposable $\bar{F}G$-module, then $X$ and $\Gamma(X)$ share some important common Green Theory Invariants. We also prove a similar result for simple modules and a formula for the number of isomorphism types of simple $\bar{F}G$-modules.

Weighted-amenability and percolation

Comments:
32 pages, 2 figures; revised several proofs, added results, and improved presentation
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In 1999, Benjamini, Lyons, Peres, and Schramm introduced a notion of weighted-amenability for transitive graphs that is equivalent to the amenability of its automorphism group. For unimodular graphs this notion coincides with classical graph-amenability and has been intensely studied. In the present work, we show that many classical unimodular results can be extended to the nonunimodular setting, which is further motivated by recent progress in the mcp (measure class preserving or quasi-pmp) setting of measured group theory. To this end, we prove new characterizations of weighted-amenability, in particular that it is equivalent to all finite unions of levels inducing amenable graphs. Hutchcroft conjectured that the latter property implies that $p_h<p_u$, where $p_h$ is the critical probability for the regime where clusters of Bernoulli percolation are infinite total weight and $p_u$ is the uniqueness threshold. We prove a relaxed version of his conjecture à la Pak--Smirnova-Nagnibeda. Further characterizations are given in terms of the spectral radius and invariant spanning forests. One of the consequences is the continuity of the phase transition at $p_h$ for weighted-nonamenable graphs.

Gromov hyperbolicity I: the dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics
Chang-Yu Guo, Manzi Huang, Xiantao Wang
Comments:
84 pages, 15 figures; all comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
This is the first article of a series of our recent works, addressing an open question of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela [5], to study the relationship between (inner) uniformality and Gromov hyperbolicity in infinite dimensional spaces. Our main focus of this paper is to establish a dimension-free Gehring-Hayman inequality for quasigeodesics.
A well-known theorem of J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 states that if $D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is quasiconformally equivalently to an uniform domain, then the Gehring-Hayman inequality holds in $D$: quasihyperbolic geodesics in $D$ minimizes the Euclidean length among all curves in $D$ with the same end points, up to a universal dimension-dependent multiplicative constant.
In this paper, we develop a new approach to strengthen the above result in the following three aspects: 1) obtain a dimension-free multiplicative constant in the Gehring-Hayman inequality; 2) relax the class of quasihyperbolic geodesics to more general quasigeodesics; 3) relax the quasiconformal equivalence to more general coarsely quasihyperbolic equivalence.
As a byproduct of our general approach, we are able to prove that the above improved Gehring-Hayman inequality indeed holds in Banach spaces. This answers affirmatively an open problem raised by J. Heinonen and S. Rohde in 1993 and reformulated by J. Väisälä in 2005.

A graph class $\mathcal{C}$ has polynomial expansion if there is a polynomial function $f$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$, each of the depth-$r$ minors of $G$ has average degree at most $f(r)$. In this note, we study bounded-radius variants of some classical graph parameters such as bramble number, linkedness and well-linkedness, and we show that they are pairwise polynomially related. Furthermore, in a monotone graph class with polynomial expansion they are all uniformly bounded by a polynomial in $r$.

Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies
Vishnu N Moothedath, Sangwon Seo, Neda Petreska, Bernhard Kloiber, James Gross
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.

Demystifying 5G Polar and LDPC Codes: A Comprehensive Review and Foundations
Mody Sy
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Understanding how 5G networks correct errors is no trivial matter. At the heart of the process lie two sophisticated families of codes: LDPC and polar codes. This paper opens the black box, not only by explaining how these codes are designed, but also by showing how they are encoded and decoded in practice. To map where research currently stands, we present a detailed survey of the literature supplemented with insights that are often buried deep within technical standards. These foundations are not just historical footnotes: they are strong candidates for powering error correction in 6G and beyond. In bringing clarity to these building blocks, we aim to help engineers and researchers navigate what is both a complex and increasingly vital part of wireless communication.

For a non-decreasing positive integer sequence $S = (s_{1}, \dots, s_{k})$, an $S$-packing edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of the edge set of $G$ into subsets $E_{1}, \dots, E_{k}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$, the distance between any two distinct edges $e_{1}, e_{2} \in E_{i}$ is at least $s_{i} + 1$. Gastineau and Togni conjectured that cubic graphs, except the Petersen and Tietze graphs, admit $(1, 1, 1, 3)$-packing edge-colorings. In this paper, we prove that every claw-free cubic graph admits such a coloring.

Stability of axial free-boundary hyperplanes in circular cones
Gian Paolo Leonardi, Giacomo Vianello
Subjects:

Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface $\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the axis of $\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special case of the vertex-skipping property that we recently proved in another article. Conversely, as soon as $n \ge 3$ and $\Omega$ has a sufficiently large aperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\Sigma$ is strictly stable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow $\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\Sigma$ associated with a compactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key property $\partial \Sigma_{t}[f] \subset \partial \Omega$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of $\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of reaction-diffusion problems.

This letter employs differential game theory to address the defense problem of a circular target area with perception constraints, involving a single defender and a single attacker. The defender is restricted to moving along the perimeter, while the mobile attacker aims to make itself to the edge of the circular target to win. We examine a scenario where both the attacker and defender face perception constraints, dividing the interaction into four distinct stages based on detection capabilities and deriving the corresponding optimal control strategies. Simulations are conducted to validate the proposed strategies.

Decorrelation transition in the Wigner minor process

We consider the Wigner minor process, i.e. the eigenvalues of an $N\times N$ Wigner matrix $H^{(N)}$ together with the eigenvalues of all its $n\times n$ minors, $H^{(n)}$, $n\le N$. The top eigenvalues of $H^{(N)}$ and those of its immediate minor $H^{(N-1)}$ are very strongly correlated, but this correlation becomes weaker for smaller minors $H^{(N-k)}$ as $k$ increases. For the GUE minor process the critical transition regime around $k\sim N^{2/3}$ was analyzed by Forrester and Nagao (J. Stat. Mech.: Theory and Experiment, 2011) providing an explicit formula for the nontrivial joint correlation function. We prove that this formula is universal, i.e. it holds for the Wigner minor process. Moreover, we give a complete analysis of the sub- and supercritical regimes both for eigenvalues and for the corresponding eigenvector overlaps, thus we prove the decorrelation transition in full generality.

In this paper, we investigate contractive projections, conditional expectations, and idempotent coefficient multipliers on the Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ for $0<p<1$. For such values of $p$, we first establish a general extension theorem for contractive projections in a probability $L^p$-space. Combining this theorem with the study of conditional expectations on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$, we characterize a broad class of contractive projections on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ that are of particular interest. Furthermore, we apply these results to give a complete characterization of contractive idempotent coefficient multipliers for the Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{T}^d)$ on the $d$-dimensional torus for $0<p<1$ and $1\leq d\leq \infty$. This complements a remarkable result of Brevig, Ortega-Cerdà, and Seip characterizing such multipliers on $H^p(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $1\leq p \leq \infty$.

Maximal rigid modules over a gentle algebra and applications to higher Auslander-Reiten theory

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
We construct a bijective correspondence between the set of rigid modules over a gentle algebra and the set of admissible arc systems on the associated coordinated-marked surface. In particular, a maximal rigid module aligns with an equivalence class of admissible $5$-partial triangulations, which is an (admissible) set of simple arcs dissecting the surface into $s$-gons with $3\leqslant s\leqslant 5$. Furthermore, the rank of the maximal rigid module is equal to the rank of the algebra plus the number of internal $4$-gons and $5$-gons in the associated $5$-partial triangulation.
Subsequently, these results facilitate an exploration of the higher Auslander-Reiten theory for gentle algebras with global dimension $n$. The $\tau_m$-closures of injective modules are realized as admissible $(m+2)$-partial triangulations, where $\tau_m$ are higher Auslander-Reiten translations with $2\leqslant m \leqslant n$. Finally, we provide a complete classification of gentle algebras that are $\tau_n$-finite or $n$-complete introduced by Iyama [I11].

We introduce a fast Fourier spectral method to compute linearized collision operators of the Boltzmann equation for variable hard-sphere gases. While the state-of-the-art method provides a computational cost O(MN^4 log N), with N being the number of modes in each direction and M being the number of quadrature points on a hemisphere, our method reduces the cost to O(N^4 log N), removing the factor M, which could be large in our numerical tests. The method is applied in a numerical solver for the steady-state Boltzmann equation with quadratic collision operators. Numerical experiments for both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations have been carried out to test the accuracy and efficiency of our method.

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Probability (math.PR)
Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we construct a multiplicative chaos measure arising from the Dirichlet series of $\alpha f$, in the whole $L^1$-regime. Our method does not rely on the thick point approach or Gaussian approximation, and uses a modified second moment method with the help of an approximate Girsanov theorem. We also employ the idea of weak convergence in $L^r$ to show that the limiting measure is independent of the choice of the approximation schemes, and this may be seen as a non-Gaussian analogue of Shamov's characterisation of multiplicative chaos.
Our class of $f$-s consists of those for which the mean value of $|f(p)|^2$ lies in $(0,1)$. In particular, it includes the indicator of sums of two squares. As an application of our construction, we establish a generalised central limit theorem for the (normalised) sums of $\alpha f$, with random variance determined by the total mass of our measure.

It has been shown that the Sierpiński gasket-like sets can appear as the Julia sets of some geometrically finite rational maps.

Based on this, we prove the existence of gasket Julia sets with positive area. Moreover, we present a criterion which guarantees the existence of gasket Julia sets in some rational maps having exactly one fixed attracting or parabolic basin.

Parameter estimation for fractional autoregressive process with periodic structure
Chunhao Cai, Yiwu Shang
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
This paper introduces a new periodic fractional autoregressive process (PFAR) driven by fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) to model time series of precipitation evapotranspiration. Compared with the similar model in [\emph{Water Resources Research}, \textbf{20} (1984) 1898--1908], the new model incorporates a periodic structure via specialized varying coefficients and captures long memory and rough voltality through fGn for $0<H<1$, rather than via fractional differencing. In this work, Generalized Least Squares Estimation (GLSE) and the GPH method are employed to construct an initial estimator for the joint estimation of model parameters. A One-Step procedure is then used to obtain a more asymptotically efficient estimator. The paper proves that both estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and their performance is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations with finite-size samples. Simulation studies suggest that, while both estimation methods can accurately estimate the model parameters, the One-Step estimator outperforms the initial estimator.

We provide an explicit representation and a sharper estimate of the commutation relations with more concise proofs than those in previous works.

Title:
A globalized inexact semismooth Newton method for strongly convex optimal control problems
Daniel Wachsmuth
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We investigate a globalized inexact semismooth Newton method applied to strongly convex optimization problems in Hilbert spaces. Here, the semismooth Newton method is appplied to the dual problem, which has a continuously differentiable objective. We prove global strong convergence of iterates as well as transition to local superlinear convergence. The latter needs a second-order Taylor expansion involving semismooth derivative concepts. The convergence of the globalized method is demonstrated in numerical examples, for which the local unglobalized method diverges.

Hands-Off Covariance Steering: Inducing Feedback Sparsity via Iteratively Reweighted $\ell_{1,p}$ Regularization

Comments:
Accepted to CDC 2025
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We consider the problem of optimally steering the state covariance matrix of a discrete-time linear stochastic system to a desired terminal covariance matrix, while inducing the control input to be zero over many time intervals. We propose to induce sparsity in the feedback gain matrices by using a sum-of-norms version of the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$-norm minimization. We show that the lossless convexification property holds even with the regularization term. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method produces a Pareto front of transient cost and sparsity that is not achievable by a simple $\ell_1$-norm minimization and closely approximates the $\ell_0$-norm minimization obtained from brute-force search.

A new monotonicity formula for quasilinear elliptic free boundary problems
Aram Karakhanyan
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We construct a monotonicity formula for a class of free boundary problems associated with the stationary points of the functional \[ J(u)=\int_\Omega F(|\nabla u|^2)+\mbox{meas}(\{u>0\}\cap \Omega), \] where $F$ is a density function satisfying some structural conditions.
The onus of proof lies with the careful analysis of the ghost function, the gradient part in the Helmholtz-Wéyl decomposition of a nonlinear flux that appears in the domain variation formula for $J(u)$.
As an application we prove full regularity for a class of quasilinear Bernoulli type free boundary problems in $\R^3$.

The isomorphism problem of regular Higman-Thompson groups was solved in arXiv:1006.1759, via embedding it into the Leavitt algebra. In this paper, we will expand these results to embed the Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees of directed graphs into the Leavitt path algebra. This embedding allows us to show that any isomorphism of rooted Leavitt path algebras induces an isomorphism between Higman-Thompson groups.

We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections on the deformed calculus are twists of their untwisted counterparts. Moreover, for cocycle deformations of a class of classical Kähler manifolds, the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one forms of the deformed calculus is shown to be a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic bimodules. Our class of examples also include cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi.

Laurent polynomials and deformations of non-isolated Gorenstein toric sigularities
Matej Filip
Subjects:

We establish a correspondence between one-parameter deformations of an affine Gorenstein toric pair $(X_P, \partial X_P)$, defined by a polytope $P$, and mutations of a Laurent polynomial $f$ with Newton polytope $\newt(f) = P$. For a Laurent polynomial $f$ in two variables, we construct a formal deformation of the three-dimensional Gorenstein toric pair $(X_{\newt(f)}, \partial X_{\newt(f)})$ over $\CC[[\bfTT_f]]$, where $\bfTT_f$ is the set of deformation parameters arising from mutations. The general fibre of this deformation is smooth if and only if $f$ is $0$-mutable. The Kodaira--Spencer map of the constructed deformation is injective, and if $f$ is maximally mutable, then the deformation cannot be nontrivially extended to a larger smooth base space.

For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.

Parametric Reachable Sets Via Controlled Dynamical Embeddings
Akash Harapanahalli, Samuel Coogan
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In this work, we propose a new framework for reachable set computation through continuous evolution of a set of parameters and offsets which define a parametope, through the intersection of constraints. This results in a dynamical approach towards nonlinear reachability analysis: a single trajectory of an embedding system provides a parametope reachable set for the original system, and uncertainties are accounted for through continuous parameter evolution. This is dual to most existing computational strategies, which define sets through some combination of generator vectors, and usually discretize the system dynamics. We show how, under some regularity assumptions of the dynamics and the set considered, any desired parameter evolution can be accommodated as long as the offset dynamics are set accordingly, providing a virtual "control input" for reachable set computation. In a special case of the theory, we demonstrate how closing the loop for the parameter dynamics using the adjoint of the linearization results in a desirable first-order cancellation of the original system dynamics. Using interval arithmetic in JAX, we demonstrate the efficiency and utility of reachable parametope computation through two numerical examples.

Encoding argumentation frameworks with set attackers to propositional logic systems
Shuai Tang, Jiachao Wu, Ning Zhou

Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been a useful tool for approximate reasoning. The encoding method is an important approach to formally model $AF$s under related semantics. The aim of this paper is to develop the encoding method from classical Dung's $AF$s ($DAF$s) to $AF$s with set attackers ($AFSA$s) including higher-level argumentation frames ($HLAF$s), Barringer's higher-order $AF$s ($BHAF$s), frameworks with sets of attacking arguments ($SETAF$s) and higher-order set $AF$s ($HSAF$s). Regarding syntactic structures, we propose the $HSAF$s where the target of an attack is either an argument or an attack and the sources are sets of arguments and attacks. Regarding semantics, we translate $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s under respective complete semantics to Łukasiewicz's 3-valued propositional logic system ($PL_3^L$). Furthermore, we propose complete semantics of $BHAF$s and $HSAF$s by respectively generalizing from $HLAF$s and $SETAF$s, and then translate to the $PL_3^L$. Moreover, for numerical semantics of $AFSA$s, we propose the equational semantics and translate to fuzzy propositional logic systems ($PL_{[0,1]}$s). This paper establishes relationships of model equivalence between an $AFSA$ under a given semantics and the encoded formula in a related propositional logic system ($PLS$). By connections of $AFSA$s and $PLS$s, this paper provides the logical foundations for $AFSA$s associated with complete semantics and equational semantics. The results advance the argumentation theory by unifying $HOAF$s and $SETAF$s under logical formalisms, paving the way for automated reasoning tools in AI, decision support, and multi-agent systems.

Rate-form equilibrium for an isotropic Cauchy-elastic formulation: Part I: modeling
Patrizio Neff, Nina J. Husemann, Sebastian Holthausen, Franz Gmeineder, Thomas Blesgen
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We derive the rate-form spatial equilibrium system for a nonlinear Cauchy elastic formulation in isotropic finite-strain elasticity. For a given explicit Cauchy stress-strain constitutive equation, we determine those properties that pertain to the appearing fourth-order stiffness tensor. Notably, we show that this stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}(\sigma)$ acting on the Zaremba-Jaumann stress rate is uniformly positive definite. We suggest a mathematical treatment of the ensuing spatial PDE-system which may ultimately lead to a local existence result, to be presented in part II of this work. As a preparatory step, we show existence and uniqueness of a subproblem based on Korn's first inequality and the positive definiteness of this stiffness tensor. The procedure is not confined to Cauchy elasticity, however in the Cauchy elastic case, most theoretical statements can be made explicit.
Our development suggests that looking at the rate-form equations of given Cauchy-elastic models may provide additional insight to the modeling of nonlinear isotropic elasticity. This especially concerns constitutive requirements emanating from the rate-formulation, here being reflected by the positive definiteness of $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}(\sigma)$.

Subjects:

The homset invariant of a knot or link L with respect to an algebraic knot coloring structure X can be identified with a set of colorings of a diagram of L by elements of X via an identification of diagrammatic generators with algebraic generators. In some cases, particularly when either L or X has a high degree of symmetry, distinct homset elements can be represented by superficially similar X-colored diagrams, potentially leading to confusion. In this short note we examine and attempt to clarify this phenomenon.

Subjects:

In this paper, we present an adaptive gradient descent method for geodesically convex optimization on a Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature. The method automatically adapts to the local geometry of the function and does not use additional expensive computations other than calculation of the derivative of the Riemannian exponential. We prove the convergence of the method under the assumption of geodesic completeness. The performance of the method is illustrated by experiments on the sphere, the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices equipped with the Bures-Wasserstein metric.

In this work, we propose the joint use of a mixed penalty-interior point method and direct search, for addressing nonlinearly constrained derivative-free optimization problems. A merit function is considered, wherein the set of nonlinear inequality constraints is divided into two groups: one treated with a logarithmic barrier approach, and another, along with the equality constraints, addressed using a penalization term. This strategy, is adapted and incorporated into a direct search method, enabling the effective handling of general nonlinear constraints. Convergence to KKT-stationary points is established under continuous differentiability assumptions, without requiring any kind of convexity. Using CUTEst test problems, numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and overall effectiveness of the proposed method, when compared with state-of-the-art solvers

A dynamic view of some anomalous phenomena in SGD
Vivek Shripad Borkar
Comments:
9 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that over-parametrized neural networks exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity (as reflected in the number of features) increases, the test error initially decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise training, viz., the test error decreases with the number of iterates, then increases, then decreases again. Another anomalous phenomenon is that of \textit{grokking} wherein two regimes of descent are interrupted by a third regime wherein the mean loss remains almost constant. This note presents a plausible explanation for these and related phenomena by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation, applied to the continuous time limit of the gradient dynamics. This gives a novel perspective for an already well studied theme.

Totally odd subdivisions in Kneser graphs

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
As evidence for the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture, Simonyi and Zsbán (2010) showed that every Kneser graph $G$ with large enough order (compared to $\chi(G)$) contains a totally odd subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$. A recent result of Steiner (2024), shows that every Schriver graph, and thus every Kneser graph, satisfies the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture, that is, it contains $K_{\chi(G)}$ as an odd minor. We strengthen these results for Kneser graphs in two ways. We show that for every $t\ge 8$, there are $t$-chromatic Kneser graphs that contain arbitrarily large complete totally odd subdivisions (and thus, odd minors). We also show that every Kneser graph contains a totally odd subdivision of $K_{\chi(G)}$.
Kneser graphs are the prime example of graphs having chromatic number equal to its topological lower bounds. Motivated by our main results, we also study totally odd immersions on graphs with this property, proving, in particular, that if the chromatic number of $G$ is equal to any of its topological lower bounds, then $G$ contains a totally odd immersion of $K_{\lfloor \chi(G)/2 \rfloor +1}$. This gives evidence for the immersion-analogue of the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture.

This article contributes to the study of the generic part of the cohomology of Shimura varieties.

Our proofs utilize the unipotent categorical local Langlands correspondence and, in contrast to previous works, do not rely on the endoscopic classification of representations or on other results established through trace formula techniques.

On a specific family of orthogonal polynomials of Bernstein-Szegö type

Subjects:

We study a class of weight functions on $[-1,1]$, which are special cases of the general weights studied by Bernstein and Szegö, as well as their extentions to the interval $[-a,1]$ for a continuous parameter $a>0$. These weights are parametrized by two positive integers. As these integers tend to infinity, these weights approximate certain weight functions on $\mathbb{R}$ considered in the earlier literature in connection with orthogonal polynomials related to elliptic functions. It turns out that an orthogonal polynomial of certain degree corresponding to these weights has a particularly simple form with known roots. This fact allows us to find explicit quadrature formulas for these weights and construct measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with identical moments. We also find finite analogs of some improper integrals first studied by Glaisher and Ramanujan, and show that some of the functions used in this work are in fact generating functions of certain finite trigonometric power sums.

Counting primes with a given primitive root, uniformly
Steve Fan, Paul Pollack
Comments:
27 pages
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
The celebrated Artin conjecture on primitive roots asserts that given any integer $g$ which is neither $-1$ nor a perfect square, there is an explicit constant $A(g)>0$ such that the number $\Pi(x;g)$ of primes $p\le x$ for which $g$ is a primitive root is asymptotically $A(g)\pi(x)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $\pi(x)$ counts the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Artin's conjecture has remained unsolved since its formulation in 1927. Nevertheless, Hooley demonstrated in 1967 that Artin's conjecture is a consequence of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for Dedekind zeta functions of certain cyclotomic-Kummer extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this paper, we use GRH to establish a uniform version of the Artin--Hooley asymptotic formula. Specifically, we prove that $\Pi(x;g) \sim A(g) x/\log{x}$ whenever $\log{x}/\log\log{2|g|} \to \infty$, i.e., whenever $x$ tends to infinity faster than any power of $\log{(2|g|)}$. Under GRH, we also show that the least prime $p_g$ possessing $g$ as a primitive root satisfies the upper bound $p_g=O(\log^{19}(2|g|))$ uniformly for all non-square $g\ne-1$. We conclude with an application to the average value of $p_g$ and a discussion of an analogue concerning the least "almost-primitive'' root.

On the positive constant in Arnold's second stability theorem for a bounded domain

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
For a steady flow of a two-dimensional ideal fluid, the gradient vectors of the stream function $\psi$ and its vorticity $\omega$ are collinear. Arnold's second stability theorem states that the flow is Lyapunov stable if $0<\nabla\omega/\nabla\psi<C_{ar}$ for some $C_{ar}>0$. In this paper, we show that, for a bounded domain, $C_{ar}$ can be taken as the first eigenvalue $\bm\Lambda_1$ of a certain Laplacian eigenvalue problem. When $\nabla\omega/\nabla\psi$ reaches $\bm\Lambda_1$, instability may occur, as illustrated by a non-circular steady flow in a disk; however, a certain form of structural stability still holds. Based on these results, we establish a theorem on the rigidity and orbital stability of steady Euler flows in a disk.

Low-altitude economy includes the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving ground robots. This paper investigates the 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory and communication optimization for low-altitude air-ground cooperation systems, where mobile unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) upload data to UAVs. We propose a joint optimization algorithm to maximize the minimal sum-rate of UGVs while ensuring quality of service and navigation constraints. The proposed algorithm integrates a successive convex approximation (SCA)-penalty method for UGV-UAV scheduling, an SCA-based approach for UGV transmit power control, and a novel warm-start particle swarm optimization with cross mutation (WS-PSO-CM). The WS-PSO-CM leverages convex optimization results from a statistical channel model to initialize particle swarm, significantly improving the performance, compared with celebrated PSO-CM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a $45.8$\% higher minimal sum-rate compared to the baseline PSO-CM under the same iterations. This gain can be translated to reducing computational time by $46.7$\% of PSO-CM. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that UAVs dynamically adjust trajectories to avoid interference by buildings, and maintain proximity to UGVs to mitigate path-loss.

Improving Travel Time Reliability with Variable Speed Limits

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper analyzes the use of variable speed limits to optimize travel time reliability for commuters. The investigation focuses on a traffic corridor with a bottleneck subject to the capacity drop phenomenon. The optimization criterion is a linear combination of the expected value and standard deviation of average travel time, with traffic flow dynamics following the kinematic wave model (Lighthill, 1955; Richards, 1956). We develop two complementary models to optimally set variable speed limits: In the first model, daily peak traffic demand is conceptualized as a stochastic variable, and the resulting model is solved through a three-stage optimization algorithm. The second model is based on deterministic demand, instead modeling bottleneck capacity as a stochastic process using a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The practical applicability of both approaches is demonstrated through numerical examples with empirically calibrated data.

We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Barański and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpiński sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.

A Stiff Order Condition Theory for Runge-Kutta Methods Applied to Semilinear ODEs
Steven B. Roberts, David Shirokoff, Abhijit Biswas, Benjamin Seibold
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Classical convergence theory of Runge-Kutta methods assumes that the time step is small relative to the Lipschitz constant of the ordinary differential equation (ODE). For stiff problems, that assumption is often violated, and a problematic degradation in accuracy, known as order reduction, can arise. Methods with high stage order, e.g., Gauss-Legendre and Radau, are known to avoid order reduction, but they must be fully implicit. For the broad class of semilinear ODEs, which consist of a stiff linear term and non-stiff nonlinear term, we show that weaker conditions suffice. Our new semilinear order conditions are formulated in terms of orthogonality relations and can be enumerated by rooted trees. Finally, we prove global error bounds that hold uniformly with respect to stiffness of the linear term.

Various characterizations of $S-r-$ideals are presented. Also, $S-uz-$ring is defined and it is proved that $H$ is an $S-uz-$ring if and only if every maximal ideal disjoint from $S$ is an $S-r-$ideal provided $S$ is finite. In addition, the $S-r-$ideal concept is examined in amalgamation and trivial extension. Finally, $S-r-$ideals are studied in polynomial rings and it is investigated that when $A[x]$ is an $S-r-$ideal of $H[x].$

Functional Analysis (math.FA)
This paper studies absolute integrability for functions with values in semi-
normed spaces and in locally convex topological vector spaces (LCTVS). We
introduce an \emph{upper-integral} approach (based on a $\rho$-variational
measure $\mu_{\rho}$) to define the spaces $\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}$ of upper
integrable functions and investigate their functional-analytic properties.
The main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the precise construction of the $\rho$-upper-integrability spaces
$\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}(A;X)$ (and their Fréchet analogues), together with the
natural semi-norms $\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}}$;
\item measure-style inequalities adapted to the variational measure
$\mu_{\rho}$ (monotone continuity for ascending sets, Fatou-type lemma, and
Chebyshev inequality) within the $\rho$-upper-integral framework;
\item functional-analytic results: sequential completeness of
$\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}([a,b];X)$ when $X$ is sequentially complete (semi-normed
case), and sequential completeness of $\mathcal{U}^p([a,b];X)$ when $X$ is a
sequentially complete Fréchet space; and
\item the closedness of the absolutely integrable subspace
$L^p_{\rho}([a,b];X)$ inside $\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}([a,b];X)$ (hence
$L^p([a,b];X)$ is a closed Fréchet subspace of $\mathcal{U}^p([a,b];X)$ under
the usual hypotheses). \end{itemize}

Improved error bounds for Koopman operator and reconstructed trajectories approximations with kernel-based methods

Comments:
24 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.

Closed curve covering and multiagent TSP ratios

Comments:

Subjects:
Metric Geometry (math.MG); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
How efficiently can a closed curve of unit length in $\mathbb{R}^d$ be covered by $k$ closed curves so as to minimize the maximum length of the $k$ curves? We show that the maximum length is at most $2k^{-1} - \frac{1}{4} k^{-4}$ for all $k\geq 2$ and $d \geq 2$. As a first byproduct, we show that $k$ agents can traverse a Euclidean TSP instance significantly faster than a single agent. We thereby sharpen recent planar results by Berendsohn, Kim, and Kozma (2025) and extend these improvements to all dimensions. As a second byproduct, we obtain a linear time approximation algorithm with ratio $2 - \frac{1}{4} k^{-3}$ for covering any closed polygonal curve in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by $k$ closed curves so that the maximum length of an individual curve is minimized.

On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps modulo prime powers

Subjects:

A discrete model of quantum ergodicity of linear maps generated by symplectic matrices $A \in \mathrm{Sp}(2d,\mathbb{Z})$ modulo an integer $N\ge 1$, has been studied for $d=1$ and almost all $N$ by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). Their result has been strengthened by J. Bourgain (2005) and subsequently by A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski, and J. F. Voloch (2023). For arbitrary $d$ this has been studied by P. Kurlberg, A. Ostafe, Z. Rudnick and I. E. Shparlinski (2024). The corresponding equidistribution results, for certain eigenfunctions, share the same feature: they apply to almost all moduli $N$ and are unable to provide an explicit construction of such ``good'' values of $N$. Here, using a bound of I. E. Shparlinski (1978) on exponential sums with linear recurrence sequences modulo a power of a fixed prime, we construct such an explicit sequence of $N$, with a power saving on the discrepancy.

For an aperiodic subshift of finite type $Y$ and for a subshift $X$ with topological entropy less than the topological entropy of $Y$, a theorem is proved in Krieger: On the subsystems of topological Markov chains, Ergodic Theory \& dynamical systems 1982 $\bold{2}$, 195-202, that says that the necessary condition on the periodic points of $X$ and $Y$ for the existence of an embedding of $X$ into $Y$ is also sufficient for the existence of an embedding of $X$ into $Y$. In this note we point out that this theorem extends to certain classes of sofic shifts as target shifts.

Quadratic units and cubic fields

Comments:

We investigate Eisenstein discriminants, which are squarefree integers $d \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ such that the fundamental unit $\varepsilon_d$ of the real quadratic field $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ satisfies $\varepsilon_d \equiv 1 \pmod{2\mathcal{O}_K}$. These discriminants are related to a classical question of Eisenstein and have connections to the class groups of orders in quadratic fields as well as to real cubic fields. We present numerical computations of Eisenstein discriminants up to $10^{11}$, suggesting that their counting function up to $x$ is approximated by $\pi_{\mathcal{E}}(x) \approx \frac{1}{3\pi^2}x - 0.024x^{5/6}$. This supports a conjecture of Stevenhagen while revealing a surprising secondary term, which is similar to (but subtly different from) the secondary term in the counting function of real cubic fields.
We include technical details of our computation method, which uses a modified infrastructure approach implemented on GPUs.

The asymptotic Mahler measure of Gaussian periods

Comments:
58 pages, 3 figures (v2: several small corrections based on feedback from readers)
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We construct a sequence of cyclotomic integers (Gaussian periods) of particularly small Mahler measure/height. We study the asymptotics of their Mahler measure as a function of their conductor, to find that the growth rate is the (multivariate) Mahler measure of a family of log Calabi-Yau varieties of increasing dimension. In turn, we study the asymptotics of some of these Mahler measures as the dimension increases, as well as properties of the associated algebraic dynamical system. We describe computational experiments that suggest that these cyclotomic integers realise the smallest non-zero logarithmic Mahler measure in the set of algebraic integers with cyclic Galois group of a given odd order. Finally, we discuss some precise conjectures that imply double logarithmic growth for those Mahler measures as a function of that order. The proofs use ideas from the theory of quantitative equidistribution, reflexive polytopes and toric varieties, the theory of random walks, Bessel functions, class field theory, and Linnik's constant.

Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) < (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $i$, then for any $0 < \epsilon < 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.

Short-time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow

In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can desingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using JLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the desingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by constructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit along their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed Lagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution with convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with corners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E. based approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for network flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.

In this article, we study the $G$-autoequivalences of the derived category $\mathbf{D}^b_G(A)$ of $G$-equivariant objects for an abelian variety $A$ with $G$ being a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Pic}^0(A)$. We provide a result analogue to Orlov's short exact sequence for derived equivalences of abelian varieties. It can be generalized to the derived equivalences of abelian varieties for a same $G$ in general. Furthermore, we find derived equivalences of generalized Kummer varieties by lifting derived equivalences of abelian surfaces using the $G$-equivariant version of Orlov's short exact sequence and some ``splitting" propositions.

Analysis of a parabolic-hyperbolic hybrid population model
Qihua Huang, Minglong Wang, Yixiang Wu
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper is concerned with the global dynamics of a hybrid parabolic-hyperbolic model describing populations with distinct dispersal and sedentary stages. We first establish the global well-posedness of solutions, prove a comparison principle, and demonstrate the asymptotic smoothness of the solution semiflow. Through the spectral analysis of the linearized system, we derive and characterize the net reproductive rate $\mathcal{R}_{0}$. Furthermore, an explicit relationship between $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ and the principal eigenvalue of the linearized system is analyzed. Under appropriate monotonicity assumptions, we show that $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ serves as a threshold parameter that completely determines the stability of steady states of the system. More precisely, when $\mathcal{R}_{0}<1$, the trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotical stable, while when $\mathcal{R}_{0}>1$, the system is uniformly persistent and there is a positive equilibrium which is unique and globally asymptotical stable.

The Directed Spanning Forest: coalescence versus dimension
Tom Garcia-Sanchez
Comments:
50 pages, 7 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
For $p\in[1,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$ directed spanning forest (DSF) of dimension $d\geq 2$ is an oriented random geometric graph whose vertex set is given by a homogeneous Poisson point process $\mathcal N$ on $\mathbb R^d$ and whose edges consist of all pairs $(x, y)\in\mathcal N^2$ such that $y$ is the closest point to $x$ in $\mathcal N$ for the $\ell^p$ distance among points with a strictly larger $e_d$ coordinate. First introduced by Baccelli and Bordenave in 2007 in the case $p=d=2$, this graph has a natural forest structure. In this work, we study the number of disjoint trees in the $\ell^p$ DSF for arbitrary dimensions $d\geq2$ and various values of $p\in [1,\infty]$. We prove that for $p\in\{1, 2,\infty\}$, the graph is almost surely a tree when $d=3$, and consists of infinitely many disjoint trees when $d\geq 4$. Additionally, we show that for all $p\in[1,\infty]$, the DSF in dimension $2$ is almost surely a tree and, under appropriate diffusive scaling, converges weakly to the Brownian web, generalizing the result previously known for p=2. Although these results were expected from a heuristic point of view, and the main strategies and tools were largely understood, extending them beyond the planar setting ($d=2$) and to the singular case $p=\infty$ presented a significant challenge. Notably, in the absence of planarity, which plays a crucial role in existing arguments, delicate and innovative techniques were required to manage the complex geometric dependencies of the model. We develop substantially new ideas to handle arbitrary dimension $d\geq2$ and various values of $p\in [1,\infty]$ within a unified framework. In particular, we introduce a novel stochastic domination argument that allows us to compare the fully dependent model with a simplified version in which the geometric correlations are suppressed.

These improvements are carefully tailored for GPU architectures and deliver substantial computational gains. Across benchmark datasets, cuPDLPx achieves 2.5x-5x speedups on MIPLIB LP relaxations and 3x-6.8x on Mittelmann's benchmark set, with particularly strong improvements in high-accuracy and presolve-enabled settings.

Enhancing Resilience Against Jamming Attacks: A Cooperative Anti-Jamming Method Using Direction Estimation

Journal-ref:
IEEE Transactions on Communications, July 2025
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience, particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large Doppler shifts.

On 7-adic Galois representations for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$
Lorenzo Furio, Davide Lombardo
Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In recent years, significant progress has been made on Mazur's Program B, with many authors beginning a systematic classification of all possible images of $p$-adic Galois representations attached to elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Currently, the classification is only complete for $p \in \{2,3,13,17\}$. The main difficulty for other primes arises from the need to understand elliptic curves whose mod-$p^n$ Galois representations are contained in the normaliser of a non-split Cartan subgroup. Equivalently, this amounts to determining the rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^+(p^n)$. Here, we consider the case $p=7$ and show that the modular curve $X_{ns}^+(49)$, of genus 69, has no non-CM rational points. To achieve this, we establish a correspondence between the rational points on $X_{ns}^+(49)$ and the primitive integer solutions of the generalised Fermat equation $a^2 + 28b^3 = 27 c^7$, the resolution of which can be reduced to determining the rational points of several genus-three curves. Furthermore, we reduce the complete classification of $7$-adic images to the determination of the rational points of a single plane quartic.

Cooperative Jamming Detection Using Low-Rank Structure of Received Signal Matrix

Journal-ref:
IEEE Transactions on Communications, July 2025
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Wireless communication can be simply subjected to malicious attacks due to its open nature and shared medium. Detecting jamming attacks is the first and necessary step to adopt the anti-jamming strategies. This paper presents novel cooperative jamming detection methods that use the low-rank structure of the received signal matrix. We employed the likelihood ratio test to propose detectors for various scenarios. We regarded several scenarios with different numbers of friendly and jamming nodes and different levels of available statistical information on noise. We also provided an analytical examination of the false alarm performance of one of the proposed detectors, which can be used to adjust the detection threshold. We discussed the synthetic signal generation and the Monte Carlo (MC)-based threshold setting method, where knowledge of the distribution of the jamming-free signal, as well as several parameters such as noise variance and channel state information (CSI), is required to accurately generate synthetic signals for threshold estimation. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed detectors outperform several existing methods, offering robust and accurate jamming detection in a collaborative network of sensing nodes.

We provide algebraic conditions on right ideals of slice regular polynomials which guarantee the irreducibility of the corresponding slice algebraic sets and show that radical ideals associated with irreducible slice algebraic sets are quasi prime. Furthermore we establish that this correspondence is an equivalence in the case of principal right ideals.

Treedepth and 2-treedepth in graphs with no long induced paths
Jędrzej Hodor, Freddie Illingworth, Tomasz Mazur
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Huynh, Joret, Micek, Seweryn, and Wollan (Combinatorica, 2022) introduced a graph parameter, later referred to as 2-treedepth and denoted $\mathrm{td}_2(\cdot)$. The parameter is the natural 2-connected version of treedepth. For every graph, 2-treedepth is at most the treedepth but can be much smaller: long paths have arbitrary treedepth but 2-treedepth equal to 2. We prove a converse showing that every graph with no induced path on $t$ vertices and 2-treedepth at most $k$ has treedepth at most $g(k, t)$. In fact, we determine the value of the function $g$ up to a multiplicative factor of 2.
Additionally, we give asymptotically tight bounds for the problem of forcing long induced paths in graphs with long paths and bounded 2-treedepth or bounded pathwidth. The latter result answers a question of Hilaire and Raymond (E-JC, 2024).

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)
We study the computation of the market equilibrium in Fisher exchange markets with divisible goods and players endowed with heterogeneous utilities. In particular, we consider the decentralized polynomial-time interior-point strategies that update \emph{only} the prices, mirroring the tâtonnement process. The key ingredient is the \emph{implicit barrier} inherent from utility maximization, which induces unbounded demand when the goods are almost free of charge. Focusing on a ubiquitous class of utilities, we formalize this observation. A companion result suggests that no additional effort is required for computing high-order derivatives; all the necessary information is readily available when collecting the best responses. To tackle the Newton systems in the interior-point methods, we present an explicitly invertible approximation of the Hessian operator with high probability guarantees, and a scaling matrix that minimizes the condition number of the linear system. Building on these tools, we design two inexact lightweight interior-point methods. One such method has $\cO(\log(\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}))$ complexity rate. Under mild conditions, the other method achieves a non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate. Preliminary experiments are presented to justify the capability of the proposed methods for large-scale problems. Extensions of our approach are also discussed.

Subjects:
Operator Algebras (math.OA)
In this paper, we introduce compact group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property. This concept simultaneously generalizes finite group actions with the weak tracial Rokhlin property and compact group actions with the tracial Rokhlin property (in the sense of the Elliott program). Under this framework, we prove that simplicity, pure infiniteness, tracial $\mathcal{Z}$-stability and the combination of nuclearity and $\mathcal{Z}$-stability can be transferred from the original algebra to the crossed product. We also show that the radius of comparison of the fixed point algebra does not exceed that of the original algebra. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between our definitions and natural generalizations of the finite group case in non-Elliott program settings. Finally, we provide a nontrivial example of a compact group action with the weak tracial Rokhlin property with comparison: an action of $(S_2)^\mathbb{N}$ on the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$. Since $\mathcal{Z}$ contains no nontrivial projections, this action does not possess the tracial Rokhlin property.

Title:
The stability index and Yau's conjecture for Carlotto-Schulz minimal hypertori
Oscar Perdomo
Comments:
This version corrects minor errors in the first submission. In particular, the multiplicity formula in Theorem 3.3 has been fixed (product instead of sum), and the lower bound for the stability index is updated to n^2+4n+3 (instead of 3n+6). The abstract and introduction have been made consistent with this correction. No other results are affected

Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Recently, for any n>1, Carlotto and Schulz showed the existence of a minimal embedding in the 2n-dimensional unit sphere. In this paper, we show that the stability index of these embedded minimal hypersurfaces is at least n^2+4n+3. We also show that Yau's conjecture holds for these examples if and only if the solution of the differential equation z''(t)+a_n(t)z'(t)+(2n-1)z(t)=0 with z(0)=1 and z'(0)=0 satisfies z'(T)>0. Here,T and the T-periodic function a_n(t) are determined in terms of the functions defining the minimal immersion.

Title:
Asymptotic breakdown point analysis of the minimum density power divergence estimator under independent non-homogeneous setups

Comments:
Pre-print; under review
Subjects:

The minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) has gained significant attention in the literature of robust inference due to its strong robustness properties and high asymptotic efficiency; it is relatively easy to compute and can be interpreted as a generalization of the classical maximum likelihood estimator. It has been successfully applied in various setups, including the case of independent and non-homogeneous (INH) observations that cover both classification and regression-type problems with a fixed design. While the local robustness of this estimator has been theoretically validated through the bounded influence function, no general result is known about the global reliability or the breakdown behavior of this estimator under the INH setup, except for the specific case of location-type models. In this paper, we extend the notion of asymptotic breakdown point from the case of independent and identically distributed data to the INH setup and derive a theoretical lower bound for the asymptotic breakdown point of the MDPDE, under some easily verifiable assumptions. These results are further illustrated with applications to some fixed design regression models and corroborated through extensive simulation studies.

The new observations about the parameter-dependent Schrödinger-Poisson system
Chen Huang, Sihua Liang, Lei Ma
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we study the existence results of solutions for the following Schrödinger-Poisson system involving different potentials:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
-\Delta u+V(x)u-\lambda \phi u=f(u)&\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3,
-\Delta\phi=u^2&\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3.
\end{cases} \end{equation*}
We first consider the case that the potential $V$ is positive and radial so that the mountain pass theorem could be implied. The other case is that the potential $V$ is coercive and sign-changing, which means that the Schrödinger operator $-\Delta +V$ is allowed to be indefinite. To deal with this more difficult case, by a local linking argument and Morse theory, the system has a nontrivial solution. Furthermore, we also show the asymptotical behavior result of this solution. Additionally, the proofs rely on new observations regarding the solutions of the Poisson equation. As a main novelty with respect to corresponding results in \cite{MR4527586,MR3148130,MR2810583}, we only assume that $f$ satisfies the super-linear growth condition at the origin. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of solutions for Schrödinger-Poisson system.

On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions

We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. The two main results in this paper are:
Result 1: If Standard conjecture D holds on $X\times X$, then all polarised endomorphisms on $X$ are semisimple.
Result 2: Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$. What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture (allowing to bound the growth of the pullback of iterations of an endomorphism on cohomology groups in terms of that on algebraic cycles), for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures should follow from Standard conjecture D. All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.

Let $\mathfrak{F}_n$ be the set of unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$, and let $S\subseteq\mathfrak{F}_n$ be an arbitrary finite subset. Given $\pi_0\in\mathfrak{F}_{n_0}$, we establish large sieve inequalities for the families $\{L(s,\pi)\colon \pi\in S\}$ and $\{L(s,\pi\times\pi_0)\colon \pi\in S\}$ that, unlike previous results, are independent of progress towards the generalized Ramanujan conjecture, and simultaneously handle the Dirichlet coefficients of $L$, $L^{-1}$, and $\log L$. We also give the first such result that improves upon the trivial bound for short sums. We present several applications, including:
(1) the strongest bound for $\sum_{\pi\in S}|L(\frac{1}{2},\pi)|^2$ that holds for arbitrary $S$,
(2) significant improvements to zero density estimates for families of automorphic and Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions, counting violations to the generalized Riemann hypothesis near $\mathrm{Re}(s)=1$,
(3) the removal of all unproven hypotheses in the conditional log-free zero density estimate for families of Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions proved by Brumley, Thorner, and Zaman, and

Differential Stochastic Variational Inequalities with Parametric Optimization

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The differential stochastic variational inequality with parametric convex optimization (DSVI-O) is an ordinary differential equation whose right-hand side involves a stochastic variational inequality and solutions of several dynamic and random parametric convex optimization problems. We consider that the distribution of the random variable is time-dependent and assume that the involved functions are continuous and the expectation is well-defined. We show that the DSVI-O has a weak solution with integrable and measurable solutions of the parametric optimization problems. Moreover, we propose a discrete scheme of DSVI-O by using a time-stepping approximation and the sample average approximation and prove the convergence of the discrete scheme. We illustrate our theoretical results of DSVI-O with applications in an embodied intelligence system for the elderly health by synthetic health care data generated by Multimodal Large Language Models.

Strichartz and local smoothing estimates for the fractional Schrödinger equations over fractal time

We obtain Strichartz-type estimates for the fractional Schrödinger operator $f \mapsto e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f$ over a time set $E$ of fractal dimension. To obtain those estimates capturing fractal nature of $E$, we employ the notions in the spirit of the Assouad dimension, such as, bounded Assouad characteristic and Assouad specturm. We also prove the estimate $$ \| e^{it(-\Delta)^{\gamma/2}} f \|_{L_t^q(\mathrm{d}\mu; L_x^r(\mathbb{R}^d))} \le C \|f\|_{H^s}, $$ where $\mu$ is a measure satisfying an $\alpha$-dimensional growth condition. In addition, we establish related inhomogeneous estimates and $L^2$ local smoothing estimates. A surprising feature of our work is that, despite dealing with rough fractal sets, we extend the known estimates for the fractional Schrödinger operators in a natural way, precisely consistent with the associated fractal dimensions.

We establish a superposition principle in disjoint variables for the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation. We show that the sum of viscosity solutions of the inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation in separate domains is a viscosity solution in the product domain. This result has been used in the literature with certain particular choices of solutions to simplify regularity analysis for a general inhomogeneous infinity-Laplace equation by reducing it to the case without sign-changing inhomogeneous terms and vanishing gradient singularities. We present a proof of this superposition principle for general viscosity solutions. We also explore generalization in metric spaces using cone comparison techniques and study related properties for general elliptic and convex equations.

Curved Kakeya sets for generic phases in odd dimensions
Shaoming Guo, Diankun Liu, Yakun Xi
Comments:
37 pages. Minor inaccuracies in the statement of our results have been addressed
Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
We show that for each odd integer $n\ge 3$, there is an open dense subset of Hörmander phase functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which the associated curved Kakeya sets have Hausdorff dimension at least $\frac{n+1}{2} + d_n$ for some positive $d_n$, thereby exceeding the classical compression threshold. In particular, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, generic Hörmander phases induce curved Kakeya sets of dimension at least $2 + \tfrac17$. As an application, on a generic three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, a local Nikodym set has Hausdorff dimension at least $2 + \tfrac17$. We achieve these results by generalizing the finite contact order condition from Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang, originally developed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, to arbitrary dimensions. Our bounds are stronger than those of Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang even in $\mathbb{R}^3$, since we derive curved Kakeya estimates directly via the polynomial method. Moreover, for Hörmander-type oscillatory integral operators with positive-definite phases of finite contact order, we obtain quantitative improvements in all odd dimensions over the bounds of Guth--Hickman--Iliopoulou, while in three dimensions our oscillatory integral estimate exactly matches the result of Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang.

Quasi one dimensional anomalous (rogue) waves in multidimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations 1: fission and fusion
Francesco Coppini, Paolo Maria Santini
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
In this paper we study the first nonlinear stage of modulation instability (NLSMI) of $x$-periodic AWs in multidimensional generalizations of the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, like the non-integrable elliptic and hyperbolic NLS equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. In the quasi one-dimensional (Q1D) regime, where the wavelength in the $x$ direction of propagation is significantly smaller than in the transversal directions, the behavior is universal, independent of the particular model at leading order, and described by adiabatic deformations of the Akhmediev breather solution of NLS. Varying the initial data, the first NLSMI shows various combinations of basic processes like AW growth from the unstable background, followed by fission in the slowly varying transversal directions, and the inverse process of fusion, followed by AW decay to the background. Fission and fusion are critical processes showing similarities with multidimensional wave breaking, and with phase transitions of second kind and critical exponent $1/2$. In $3+1$ dimensions with radial symmetry in the transversal slowly varying plane, fission consists in the formation of an opening smoke ring centered on the $x$ axis. In the long wave limit, the Q1D Akhmediev breather reduces to the Q1D analogue of the Peregrine instanton, rationally localized in space. Numerical experiments on the hyperbolic NLS equation show that the process of "AW growth + fission" is not restricted to the Q1D regime, extending to a finite area of the modulation instability domain. The universality of these processes suggests their observability in natural phenomena related to AWs in contexts such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and plasma physics.

Localization: A Framework to Generalize Extremal Problems
Rajat Adak, L. Sunil Chandran
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
Extremal graph theory studies the maximum or minimum number of subgraphs isomorphic to a prescribed graph under given constraints. \textit{Localization} has recently emerged as a framework that refines such problems by assigning extremal quantities locally (to vertices or edges) and then aggregating them. This perspective not only recovers classical results but also leads to sharper bounds.
A classical result states that a connected planar graph with a finite girth $g$ satisfies \begin{equation*}
m \leq \frac{g}{g-2}(n-2) \end{equation*} Wood~\cite{wood} derived upper bounds on the number of $K_t$-cliques in graphs of bounded maximum degree, expressed in terms of both the number of vertices and the number of edges: \begin{align*}
ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t} \\ mex(m,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{d+1}{2}}\binom{d+1}{t} \end{align*} More recently, Chakraborty and Chen~\cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established a similar upper bound for graphs with bounded path length: \begin{equation*}
mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t} \end{equation*}
In this paper, we employ the localization framework to improve these bounds and provide structural characterizations of the extremal graphs attaining them.

Extended version of the paper accepted at CDC 2025, including proof sketches
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper studies a combined space partitioning and network flow optimization problem, with applications to large-scale power, transportation, or communication systems. In dense wireless networks, one may want to simultaneously optimize the assignment of many spatially distributed users to base stations and route the resulting communication traffic through the backbone network. We formulate the overall problem by coupling a semi-discrete optimal transport (SDOT) problem, capturing the space partitioning component, with a minimum-cost flow problem on a discrete network. This formulation jointly optimizes the assignment of a continuous demand distribution to certain endpoint network nodes and the routing of flows over the network to serve the demand, under capacity constraints. As for SDOT problems, we show that the formulation of our problem admits a tight relaxation taking the form of an infinite-dimensional linear program, derive a finite-dimensional dual problem, and show that strong duality holds. We leverage these results to design a distributed dual gradient ascent algorithm to solve the problem, where nodes in the graph perform computations based solely on locally available information. Simulation results illustrate the algorithm performance and its applicability to an electric power distribution network reconfiguration problem. This version extends the CDC 2025 conference paper with additional proof sketches.

Robust and fast iterative method for the elliptic Monge-Ampère equation

This paper introduces a fast and robust iterative scheme for the elliptic Monge-Ampère equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The Monge-Ampère equation is a nonlinear and degenerate equation, with applications in optimal transport, geometric optics, and differential geometry. The proposed method linearises the equation and uses a fixed-point iteration (L-scheme), solving a Poisson problem in each step with a weighted residual as the right-hand side. This algorithm is robust against discretisation, nonlinearities, and degeneracies. For a weight greater than the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, contraction in $H^2$ and $L^\infty$ is proven for both classical and generalised solutions, respectively. The method's performance can be enhanced by using preconditioners or Green's functions. Test cases demonstrate that the scheme outperforms Newton's method in speed and stability.

On integral extensions between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers
Minkyu Kim, Christine Vespa
Comments:
30 pages
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
This paper aims to study Ext-groups between certain functors defined on the category of finitely generated free groups. Rational Ext-groups between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers are known, and are almost always equal to zero. Recently, using homotopical methods, Arone constructed an explicit bounded complex whose homology corresponds to the integral Ext-groups between the abelianization functor and its symmetric powers. The homology of this complex is far from being trivial. Using this complex, we explicitly calculate some of these Ext-groups. More precisely, we compute Ext^1, Ext^2, Ext^{d-1} and Ext^{d-2} between the abelianization functor and its dth symmetric power. We further explain how Arone's complex can be obtained from an explicit projective resolution of the abelianization functor. We compare our results with the computation of Ext-groups between functors from finitely generated free abelian groups, obtained by Franjou and Pirashvili. In particular, we obtain that the composition with the abelianization functor induces an isomorphism for the Ext^1 considered in this paper.

Complexity of Effective Reductions with Ordinal Turing Machines
Merlin Carl
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
In arXiv:1811.11630, we introduced a notion of effective reducibility between set-theoretical $\Pi_{2}$-statements; in arXiv:2411.19386, this was extended to statements of arbitrary (potentially even infinite) quantifier complexity. We also considered a corresponding notion of Weihrauch reducibility, which allows only one call to the effectivizer of $\psi$ in a reduction of $\phi$ to $\psi$. In this paper, we refine this notion considerably by asking how many calls to an effectivizer for $\psi$ are required for effectivizing $\phi$. This allows us make formally precise questions such as ``how many ordinals does one need to check for being cardinals in order to compute the cardinality of a given ordinal?'' and (partially) answer many of them. Many of these anwers turn out to be independent of ZFC.

Hyperbolic Keller-Segel equations with sensitivity adjustment in Besov spaces: Global well-posedness and blow-up criteria
Bo Bi, Lei Zhang
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
This paper focuses on the initial value problem for the hyperbolic Keller-Segel (HKS) equation with sensitivity adjustment in Besov sapces over $\mathbb{R}^d$: $\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot \left(\varrho (t) u (1 - u) \nabla S \right)= 0$, $\Delta S = S - u$, where $\varrho (t) (1 - u)$ denotes the adjustment of the classical chemotaxis sensitively by virtue of a time-dependent function $\varrho$. In the case of $\varrho\equiv 1$, existed results [Zhou et al., \emph{J. Differ. Equ.}, 302 (2021) 662-679] and [Zhang et al., \emph{J. Differ. Equ.}, 334 (2022) 451-489] have shown that the HKS equation admits local-in-time Besov solution, whereas the global theory in Besov space still remains an unsolved problem. The main novelty of our observation lies in the fact that if the chemotaxis sensitivity is adjusted by the function $\varrho(t)$ with suitable integrability over $[0,\infty)$, then the associated HKS equation possesses a unique global-in-time Besov solution. As an application, we conclude that the HKS equation with weakly dissipation $-\lambda u$ (i.e., a nonzero interaction-related source term) can also be globally solved in the framework of Besov spaces. Moreover, we derive two types of blow-up criteria for strong solutions in both critical and non-critical Besov spaces, and explicitly characterize the lower bound of blow-up time. These findings reveals how time-dependent parameters (especially, the dissipation parameter $\lambda$) affect the global existence of solutions.

Flows with minimal subdynamics

Let $\Gamma$ be a countably infinite discrete group. A $\Gamma$-flow $X$ (i.e., a nonempty compact Hausdorff space equipped with a continuous action of $\Gamma$) is called $S$-minimal for a subset $S \subseteq \Gamma$ if the partial orbit $S \cdot x$ is dense for every point $x \in X$. We show that for any countable family $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite subsets of $\Gamma$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $X$ that is $S_n$-minimal for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$; additionally, $X$ can be taken to be a subflow of $2^\Gamma$. This vastly generalizes a result of Frisch, Seward, and Zucker, in which each $S_n$ is required to be a normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. As a corollary, we show that for a given Polish $\Gamma$-flow $X$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $Y$ disjoint from $X$ in the sense of Furstenberg if and only if $X$ has no wandering points. This completes a line of inquiry started by Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. As another application, we strengthen some of the results of Gao, Jackson, Krohne, and Seward on the structure of Borel complete sections. For example, we show that if $B$ is a Borel complete section in the free part of $2^\Gamma$, then every union of sufficiently many shifts of $B$ contains an orbit (previously, this was only known for open sets $B$). Although our main results are purely dynamical, their proofs rely on recently developed machinery from descriptive set-theoretic combinatorics, namely the asymptotic separation index introduced by Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob and its links to the Lovász Local Lemma.

Subjects:

We study GKZ-type D-modules arising from the actions of commutative linear algebraic groups G = TU (where T is a torus and U is unipotent) on a vector space. Building on Hotta's equivariant D-module framework, we formalize a Fourier-orbit construction that recovers the classical toric GKZ system and extends it to mixed torus-unipotent settings. We prove generic holonomicity via a parameter-free symbolic moment ideal and introduce two symbolic tools - the tp-envelope and the symbolic cap - for effective rank analysis and, under mild regularity, exact rank computation. A torus slice yields an explicit lower bound by the normalized lattice volume, explaining sharpness in the pure torus case. Examples exhibit irregular (Airy-type) behavior and resonant non-holonomicity, highlighting new phenomena beyond the toric setting.

Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two stochastic linear time invariant systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.

Building on a previous work by Coudène and Schapira we introduce the set of \textit{weakly regular} vectors, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_w$: a vector in the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold is weakly regular if for all $\epsilon>0$, its $\epsilon$-stable set and $\epsilon$-unstable set both intersect the set $\Omega_{NF}$ of non-wandering vectors whose orbit does not bound a flat strip. We show that every ergodic probability measure supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$ can be approximated by Dirac measures supported on periodic orbits in $\Omega_{NF}$. As a consequence, ergodicity is a generic property in the space of invariant measures supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$. We illustrate our findings using a famous example of rank-one manifold attributed to Heintze and Gromov, demonstrating that in this setting the inclusion $\Omega_{NF} \subset \mathcal{R}_w$ is proper and $\mathcal{R}_w$ is the maximal subset of the unit-tangent bundle satisfying the density property stated above. Finally, as a consequence of our main result, we describe the topology of the closure of the set of ergodic probability measures and provide a complete decomposition of the space of finite invariant measures on the unit-tangent bundle of the Heintze-Gromov manifold.

Centered Moments of Weighted One-Level Densities of $GL(2)$ $L$-Functions

Katz and Sarnak conjectured that the behavior of zeros near the central point of any family of $L$-functions is well-modeled by the behavior of eigenvalues near $1$ of some classical compact group (either the symplectic, unitary, or even, odd, or full orthogonal group). In 2018, Knightly and Reno proved that the symmetry group can vary depending on how the $L$-functions in the family are weighted. They observed both orthogonal and symplectic symmetry in the one-level densities of families of cuspidal newform $L$-functions for different choices of weights. We observe the same dependence of symmetry on weights in the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments of these one-level densities, for smooth test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in $\left(-\frac{1}{2n}, \frac{1}{2n}\right)$. To treat the new terms that emerge in our $n$-level calculations when $n>1$, i.e., the cross terms that emerge from $n$-fold products of primes rather than individual primes, we generalize Knightly and Reno's weighted trace formula from primes to arbitrary positive integers. We then perform a delicate analysis of these cross terms to distinguish their contributions to the main and error terms of the $n^{\text{th}}$ centered moments. The final novelty here is an elementary combinatorial trick that we use to rewrite the main number theoretic terms arising from our analysis, facilitating comparisons with random matrix theory.

Interior Spectral Windows and Transport for Discrete Fractional Laplacians on $d$-Dimensional Hypercubic Lattices
Nassim Athmouni
Subjects:
Spectral Theory (math.SP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We study anisotropic fractional discrete Laplacians $\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}$ with exponents $\vec{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. We establish a Mourre estimate on compact energy intervals away from thresholds. As consequences we derive a Limiting Absorption Principle in weighted spaces, propagation estimates (minimal velocity and local decay), and the existence and completeness of local wave operators for perturbations $H=\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}+W(Q)$, where $W$ is an anisotropically decaying potential of long--range type. In the stationary scattering framework we construct the on--shell scattering matrix $S(\lambda)$, prove the optical theorem, and, under a standard trace--class assumption on $W$, establish the Birman--Krein formula $\det S(\lambda)=\exp(-2\pi i\,\xi(\lambda))$.

Planar Turán numbers of three configurations
Xuqing Bai, Zhipeng Gao, Ping Li
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The planar Tuán number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is defined as the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The exact value of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$ remains a mystery when $H$ is large (for example, $H$ is a long path or a long cycle), while tight bounds have been established for many small planar graphs such as cycles, paths, $\Theta$-graphs and other small graphs formed by a union of them.
One representative graph among such union graphs is $K_1+L$ where $L$ is a linear forest without isolated vertices.
Previous works solved the cases when $L$ is a path or a matching.
In this work, we first investigate the planar Turán number of the graph $K_1+L$ when $L$ is the disjoint union of a $P_2$ and $P_3$.
Equivalently, $K_1+L$ represents a specific configuration formed by combining a $C_3$ and a $\Theta_4$.
We further consider the planar Turán numbers of the all graphs obtained by combining $C_3$ and $\Theta_4$. Among the six possible such configurations, three have been resolved in earlier works. For the remaining three configurations (including
$K_1+(P_2\dot{\cup}P_3)$), we derive tight bounds. Furthermore, we completely characterize all extremal graphs for the remaining two of these three cases.

The aim of this article is to study basic structures and interrelations of $\delta$-rings, perfectoid towers, and lim Cohen-Macaulay sequences over Noetherian rings in positive or mixed characteristic. Then we discuss some methods for constructing perfectoid towers, dealing with $p$-torsion free and $p$-torsion cases, respectively. Some interesting examples arise as quotients by monomial or binomial ideals or determinantal rings. We also explain a geometric method with a view toward constructing rings with certain singularities.

On the convergence rate of the Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm

Subjects:

This work is concerned with the convergence rate analysis of the Douglas-Rachford splitting (DRS) method for finding a zero of the sum of two maximally monotone operators. We obtain an exact rate of convergence for the DRS algorithm and demonstrate its sharpness in the setting of convex feasibility problems. Furthermore, we investigate the linear convergence of the DRS algorithm, providing both necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize this behavior. We further examine the performance of the DRS method when applied to convex composite optimization problems. The paper concludes with several conjectures on the convergence behavior of the DRS algorithm for this class of problems.

Contour Integrations and Parity Results of Cyclotomic Euler $T$-Sums and Multiple $t$-Values
Zhenlu Wang, Ce Xu
Comments:
25 pages
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We will employ the method of contour integration to investigate the parity results of non-embedded cyclotomic multiple $t$-values, which we refer to as cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums. We can provide explicit parity formulas for the linear and quadratic cases of cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums, as well as state a parity theorem for the general case. We also present illustrative examples and corollaries. From this, some parity results for classical cyclotomic multiple $t$-values can be derived. Furthermore, we present several general formulas for cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums with denominators involving arbitrary rational polynomials through residue computations. By evaluating these polynomials and computing residues, many other formulas analogous to cyclotomic Euler $T$-sums can be derived. In particular, we also obtain certain parity results for the cyclotomic versions of multiple $T$-values as defined by Kaneko and Tsumura. Finally, we propose some conjectures and questions regarding the parity of cyclotomic multiple $t$-values and cyclotomic multiple $T$-values.

How to find all extremal graphs using symmetric subgraphs
Wenqian Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of graphs with $\min_{F\in \mathcal{F}}\chi(F)=r+1\geq3$, where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. Set $t=\max_{F\in\mathcal{F}}|F|$. Let ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with maximum edges among all the graphs of order $n$ without any $F\in\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. Let $T(n,r)$ be the Turán graph of order $n$ with $r$ parts. Assume that some $F_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$ is a subgraph of the graph obtained from $T(rt,r)$ by embedding a path in its one part. Simonovits \cite{S1} introduced the concept of symmetric subgraphs, and proved that there exist graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ which have symmetrical property. In this paper, we aim to find a way to characterize all the extremal graphs for such $\mathcal{F}$ using symmetric subgraphs. Some new extremal results are obtained.

Spectral Broadening of Landau Levels by a Penetrable Circular Wall
Masahiro Kaminaga
Comments:
27 pages, 3 figures
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study the two--dimensional magnetic Schrödinger operator with a penetrable circular wall modeled by a $\delta$--interaction. Using the boundary triple approach we classify all self--adjoint extensions and obtain Krein's resolvent formula, showing that the essential spectrum coincides with the Landau levels. The wall breaks their infinite degeneracy and produces a spectral broadening: each Landau level becomes an accumulation point of discrete eigenvalues from one side. In the circular case, rotational symmetry reduces the eigenvalue problem to scalar equations with explicit Weyl coefficients. We prove strict monotonicity, ensuring that each angular momentum channel contributes at most one eigenvalue per gap, and derive asymptotics showing that the boundary coefficients decay faster than any exponential, explaining the strong localization of the broadened spectrum. Numerical simulations are consistent with these results.

On the Lebesgue Constant of Extended-Domain Spectral Methods for Elliptic PDEs
Po-Yi Wu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The extended-domain method is a simple and effective strategy for applying spectral methods to complex geometries. Its stability, however, is complicated by the use of a Fourier extension basis, which is known to be exponentially ill-conditioned. Numerical experiments reveal a discrepancy: the method appears stable for the non-self-adjoint convection-diffusion equation but unstable for the self-adjoint Poisson equation. This paper provides a rigorous analysis that resolves this issue. We first prove that the method is asymptotically unstable for both operators; the Lebesgue constant is shown to grow exponentially as a direct consequence of the frame redundancy of the basis. We then explain the observed discrepancy as a pre-asymptotic phenomenon. We prove a structural dichotomy in the discrete Green's functions (the inverses of the physical-space operators): the inverse of the convection-diffusion operator is numerically quasi-sparse, with entries that decay exponentially off-diagonal, in stark contrast to the numerically dense inverse of the Poisson operator. This framework provides a rigorous theoretical foundation that reconciles the method's practical utility in certain regimes with its ultimate asymptotic instability.

Let $d_1 = 1 < d_2 < d_3 < \cdots < d_{\tau(n)} = n$ denote the increasing sequence of the divisors of a positive integer $n$. In this paper, for real or complex values of $\alpha$, we define and study some properties of two new divisor functions $\sigma_{e,\alpha}$ and $\sigma_{o,\alpha}$. The first computes the sum of the $\alpha$-th powers of the divisors of $n$ with even indices, and the second computes the sum of the $\alpha$-th powers of the divisors of $n$ with odd indices. We also introduce a new type of positive integers, namely, $k$-index ratio numbers and state three conjectures related to them.

Asymptotic structure. III. Excluding a fat tree

Subjects:

Robertson and Seymour proved that for every finite tree $H$, there exists $k$ such that every finite graph $G$ with no $H$ minor has path-width at most $k$; and conversely, for every integer $k$, there is a finite tree $H$ such that every finite graph $G$ with an $H$ minor has path-width more than $k$. If we (twice) replace ``path-width'' by ``line-width'', the same is true for infinite graphs $G$.
We prove a ``coarse graph theory'' analogue, as follows. For every finite tree $H$ and every $c$, there exist $k,L,C$ such that every graph that does not contain $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits an $(L,C)$-quasi-isonetry to a graph with line-width at most $k$; and conversely, for all $k,L,C$ there exist $c$ and a finite tree $H$ such that every graph that contains $H$ as a $c$-fat minor admits no $(L,C)$-quasi-isometry to a graph with line-width at most $k$.

This article considers the family of elliptic curves given by $E_{p}: y^2=x^3-5px$ and certain conditions on an odd prime $p$. More specifically, we have shown that if $p \equiv 7, 23 \pmod {40}$, then the rank of $E_{p}$ is zero for both $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{Q}(i) $. Furthermore, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_1 + 3 $ or $ 40k_2 + 27$, where $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(5k_1+1)$ or $(5k_2 +4)$ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Moreover, if the prime $ p $ is of the form $ 40k_3 + 11 $ or $ 40k_4 + 19$ where $k_3 ~\text{and}~ k_4 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $(160k_3+49)$ or $(160k_4 + 81) $ are perfect squares, then the given family of elliptic curves has rank at least one over $\mathbb{Q}$ and rank at least two over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$.

Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation
Hanfei Zhou, Lei Shi
Subjects:

A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in Hölder-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry.

Let $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the field of characteristic two, $\mathbb F_2.$ Denote by $GL(q)$ the general linear group of rank $q$ over $\mathbb F_2.$ The algebraic transfer, introduced by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is a rather effective tool for unraveling the intricate structure of the (mod-2) cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{q,*}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2).$ The Kameko homomorphism is one of the useful tools to study the dimension of the domain of the Singer transfer. Singer conjectured that the algebraic transfer is always a monomorphism, but this remains open for all homology degrees $q\geq 5.$ In this paper, by constructing a novel algorithm implemented in the computer algebra system OSCAR for computing $GL(q)$-invariants of the kernel of the Kameko homomorphism, we disprove Singer's conjecture for bidegree $(6, 6+36).$

We prove that for any fixed integer \( n \geq 3 \) and nonzero integer \( m \), the proportion of integral binary forms of degree \( n \) that represent \( m \) tends to zero as the height tends to infinity. In fact, almost all such forms fail to represent \( m \). Our method uses lattice point counting and geometric methods, including Davenport's lemma and estimates for volumes of hyperplane sections of cubes, together with an analysis of the distribution of rational points on such hyperplanes. The result also holds when restricted to irreducible forms.

We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.

The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems are widely studied in fields of operations research, stochastic optimization, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we consider the classical MAB model with heavy-tailed reward distributions and introduce the extended robust UCB policy, which is an extension of the results of Bubeck et al. [5] and Lattimore [22] that are further based on the pioneering idea of UCB policies [e.g. Auer et al. 3]. The previous UCB policies require some strict conditions on reward distributions, which can be difficult to guarantee in practical scenarios. Our extended robust UCB generalizes Lattimore's seminary work (for moments of orders $p=4$ and $q=2$) to arbitrarily chosen $p>q>1$ as long as the two moments have a known controlled relationship, while still achieving the optimal regret growth order $O(log T)$, thus providing a broadened application area of UCB policies for heavy-tailed reward distributions. Furthermore, we achieve a near-optimal regret order without any knowledge of the reward distributions as long as their $p$-th moments exist for some $p>1$. Finally, we briefly present our earlier work on light-tailed reward distributions for a complete illustration of the amazing simplicity and power of UCB policies.

The kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy~(MMD) is a popular multivariate distance metric between distributions that has found utility in two-sample testing. The usual kernel-MMD test statistic is a degenerate U-statistic under the null, and thus it has an intractable limiting distribution. Hence, to design a level-$\alpha$ test, one usually selects the rejection threshold as the $(1-\alpha)$-quantile of the permutation distribution. The resulting nonparametric test has finite-sample validity but suffers from large computational cost, since every permutation takes quadratic time. We propose the cross-MMD, a new quadratic-time MMD test statistic based on sample-splitting and studentization. We prove that under mild assumptions, the cross-MMD has a limiting standard Gaussian distribution under the null. Importantly, we also show that the resulting test is consistent against any fixed alternative, and when using the Gaussian kernel, it has minimax rate-optimal power against local alternatives. For large sample sizes, our new cross-MMD provides a significant speedup over the MMD, for only a slight loss in power.

Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.

Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory

Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.

This paper investigates a pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents: a pursuer, an evader, and a defender. Cooperative guidance laws are developed for the evader-defender team that guarantee interception of the pursuer by the defender before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, a geometry-based solution is proposed to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another notable feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy, yet the pursuer's interception is guaranteed for arbitrary initial engagement geometries. It is further shown that the relevant error variables for the evader-defender team (or individual) converge to zero at a prespecified finite time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative pursuit-evasion strategy is demonstrated through simulations across diverse engagement scenarios.

We show that structural smooth transition vector autoregressive models are statistically identified if the shocks are mutually independent and at most one of them is Gaussian. This extends a known identification result for linear structural vector autoregressions to a time-varying impact matrix. We also propose an estimation method, show how a blended identification strategy can be adopted to address weak identification, and establish a sufficient condition for ergodic stationarity. The introduced methods are implemented in the accompanying R package sstvars. Our empirical application finds that a positive climate policy uncertainty shock reduces production and raises inflation under both low and high economic policy uncertainty, but its effects, particularly on inflation, are stronger during the latter.

In this manuscript, we address the issue of the loss of SU(2) internal symmetry in Loop Quantum Cosmology and its relationship with Loop Quantum Gravity. Drawing inspiration from Yang-Mills theory and employing the framework of fiber bundle theory, we propose a new gauge-invariant symmetry-reduction approach. Using this method, we successfully identify a cosmological sector of General Relativity in terms of Ashtekar variables that preserves the SU(2) structure of the theory as well as part of the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry. Additionally, we analyze the properties of cylindrical functions and the classical constraint algebra, revealing that certain cylindrical functions exhibit distinctive symmetry features.

We establish a scalable manifold learning method and theory, motivated by the problem of estimating fMRI activation manifolds in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our primary contribution is the development of an efficient estimation technique for heat kernel Gaussian processes in the exponential family model. This approach handles large sample sizes $n$, preserves the intrinsic geometry of data, and significantly reduces computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ via a novel reduced-rank approximation of the graph Laplacian's transition matrix and a Truncated Singular Value Decomposition for the eigenpair computation. The numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability and improved accuracy of our method for manifold learning tasks involving complex large-scale data.

Continuum Attention for Neural Operators

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we state and prove the first universal approximation result for transformer neural operators, using only a slight modification of the architecture implemented in practice. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel in terms of singular values and their functions (e.g., achievable rate and harvestable power) for improved wireless performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering model and adopt a Beyond-Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for passive signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical tight bounds are derived under typical RIS deployment scenarios to unveil the channel shaping potentials of BD-RIS regarding communication Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. An efficient numerical method is then proposed to optimize BD-RIS for any locally Lipschitz function of channel singular values, and showcased to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) approach and a low-complexity shaping approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of channel singular values and the tradeoff in manipulating them, thus offering enhanced data rate, harvestable power, and physical-layer security. These advantages become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements, group size, or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission and achieve the asymptotic DoF at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its proficiency in channel shaping.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the single largest and most detailed scientific effort ever conducted to quantify levels and trends in health. This global health model to estimate mortality rates and other health metrics is run at different scales, leading to large data sets of results for a global region and its different sub-regions, or for a cause of death and different sub-causes for example. These models do not necessarily lead to consistent data tables where, for instance, the sum of the number of deaths for each of the sub-regions is equal to the number of deaths for the global region. Raking is widely used in survey inference and global health models to adjust the observations in contingency tables to given marginals, in the latter case reconciling estimates between models with different granularities. The results of global health models usually associate to the point estimates an uncertainty, such as standard deviations or confidence intervals. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty propagation approach that obtains, at the cost of a single solve, nearly the same uncertainty estimates as computationally intensive Monte Carlo techniques that pass thousands of observed and marginal samples through the entire raking process. We introduce a convex optimization approach that provides a unified framework to raking extensions such as uncertainty propagation, raking with differential weights, raking with different loss functions in order to ensure that bounds on estimates are respected, verifying the feasibility of the constraints, raking to margins either as hard constraints or as aggregate observations, and handling missing data.

Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems
Wei Zhang, Jr-Shin Li
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for large-scale systems, comprising extensive populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments, has surged significantly across diverse scientific domains in recent years. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often leads to high computational costs or reduced performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture and derive effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such systems as parameterized control systems defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform that maps the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. To enhance the algorithm's efficiency, we exploit early stopping at each hierarchy, demonstrating the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples in engineering and quantum systems.

We present a method for incorporating a stochastic point of view into physics exercises of mathematics education. The core of our method is the randomization of some inputs, the system model used does not differ from what we would use in the deterministic approach. We consider exercises from the theory of projectile motion and statics. The outputs of stochastic models are random variables, and we usually determine their probability distributions, expected values, variances, and relative standard deviations, and the probabilities of some events related to them are also calculated. Students and teachers familiar with elementary probability theory and mechanics may find these exercises useful for understanding some basic concepts of stochastic mechanics.

On the Lower Confidence Band for the Optimal Welfare in Policy Learning
Kirill Ponomarev, Vira Semenova
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We study inference on the optimal welfare in a policy learning problem and propose reporting a lower confidence band (LCB). A natural approach to constructing an LCB is to invert a one-sided t-test based on an efficient estimator for the optimal welfare. However, we show that for an empirically relevant class of DGPs, such an LCB can be first-order dominated by an LCB based on a welfare estimate for a suitable suboptimal treatment policy. We show that such first-order dominance is possible if and only if the optimal treatment policy is not ``well-separated'' from the rest, in the sense of the commonly imposed margin condition. When this condition fails, standard debiased inference methods are not applicable. We show that uniformly valid and easy-to-compute LCBs can be constructed analytically by inverting moment-inequality tests with the maximum and quasi-likelihood-ratio test statistics. As an empirical illustration, we revisit the National JTPA study and find that the proposed LCBs achieve reliable coverage and competitive length.

Quantum low-density parity-check codes, such as the Kitaev toric code and bivariate bicycle codes, are often defined with periodic boundary conditions, which are difficult to realize in physical systems. In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing all gapped boundaries and defects of two-dimensional Pauli stabilizer codes. Using the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data, such as anyon fusion rules and topological spins, of two-dimensional bulk stabilizer codes and one-dimensional boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits for both prime and nonprime $d$, enabling exploration of topological phases beyond the Kitaev toric code. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. Finally, we study the boundaries of bivariate bicycle codes, showing that they exhibit large logical dimensions and anyons with long translation periods.

Adapting Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models using Projected Gaussian Process

Projection-based model reduction is among the most widely adopted methods for constructing parametric Reduced-Order Models (ROM). Utilizing the snapshot data from solving full-order governing equations, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) computes the optimal basis modes that represent the data, and a ROM can be constructed in the low-dimensional vector subspace spanned by the POD basis. For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises when there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately capture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in design, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.). In this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the problem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem, for which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the Grassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly established between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an orthogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A second mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is established through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its tangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of a vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP) regression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold that enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a statistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate (or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical uncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP are demonstrated by numerical experiments.

We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.

We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.

Consistent deformations in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach
Jordi Frias, Maxim Grigoriev
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We develop a framework for studying consistent interactions of local gauge theories, which is based on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ formulation. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates in terms of finite-dimensional spaces and avoids working with quotient spaces such as local functionals or functionals modulo on-shell trivial ones. The structure that is being deformed is that of a presymplectic gauge PDE, which consists of a graded presymplectic structure and a compatible odd vector field. These are known to encode the Batalin--Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of a local gauge theory in terms of the finite dimensional supergeometrical object. Although in its present version the method is limited to interactions that do not deform the presymplectic structure and relies on some natural assumptions, it gives a remarkably simple way to analyse consistent interactions. The approach can be considered as the BV-AKSZ extension of the frame-like approach to consistent interactions. We also describe the underlying homological deformation theory, which turns out to be slightly unusual compared to the standard deformations of differential graded Lie algebras. As an illustration, the Chern-Simons and YM theories are rederived starting from their linearized versions.

We identify all pure KD-positive states and all KD-real observables for these KD representations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring that all KD-positive states are convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. We prove that for $G=\Z_{d}$, with $d$ a prime power, this condition is satisfied. We provide examples of abelian groups where it is not. In those cases, the convex set of KD-positive states contains states outside the convex hull of the pure KD-positive states.

Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.

This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.

Explaining Robust Quantum Metrology by Counting Codewords

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Quantum sensing holds great promise for high-precision magnetic field measurements. However, its performance is significantly limited by noise. The investigation of active quantum error correction to address this noise led to the Hamiltonian-Not-in-Lindblad-Span (HNLS) condition. This states that Heisenberg scaling is achievable if and only if the signal Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the Lindblad operators describing the noise. In this work, we consider a robust quantum metrology setting where the probe state is inspired from CSS codes for noise resilience but there is no active error correction performed. After the state picks up the signal, we measure the code's $\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer the magnetic field parameter, $\theta$. Given $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all stabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\theta$. The uncertainty in $\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity, the \textit{Robustness Bound}, which ties the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement to the number of weight-$2$ codewords of the dual code. Through this novel lens of coding theory, we show that for nontrivial CSS code states the HNLS condition still governs the Heisenberg scaling in our robust metrology setting. Our finding suggests fundamental limitations in the use of linear quantum codes for dephased magnetic field sensing applications both in the near-term robust sensing regime and in the long-term fault tolerant era. We also extend our results to general scenarios beyond dephased magnetic field sensing.

Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau threefolds from Wilson loops

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We relate the counting of refined BPS numbers on compact elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau threefolds $X$ to Wilson loop expectations values in the gauge theories that emerge in various rigid local limits of the 5d supergravity theory defined by M-theory compactification on $X$. In these local limits $X_*$ the volumes of curves in certain classes go to infinity, the corresponding very massive M2-brane states can be treated as Wilson loop particles and the refined topological string partition function on $X$ becomes a sum of terms proportional to associated refined Wilson loop expectation values. The resulting ansatz for the complete refined topological partition function on $X$ is written in terms of the proportionality coefficients which depend only on the $\epsilon$ deformations and the Wilson loop expectations values which satisfy holomorphic anomaly equations. Since the ansatz is quite restrictive and can be further constrained by the one-form symmetries and E-string type limits for large base curves, we can efficiently evaluate the refined BPS numbers on $X$, which we do explicitly for local gauge groups up to rank three and $h_{11}(X)=5$. These refined BPS numbers pass an impressive number of consistency checks imposed by the direct counting of these numbers using the moduli space of one dimensional stable sheaves on $X$ and give us numerical predictions for the complex structure dependency of the refined BPS numbers.

We formalize the generalization error bound using the Rademacher complexity for the Lean 4 theorem prover based on the probability theory in the Mathlib 4 library. Generalization error quantifies the gap between a learning machine's performance on given training data versus unseen test data, and the Rademacher complexity is a powerful tool to upper-bound the generalization error of a variety of modern learning problems. Previous studies have only formalized extremely simple cases such as bounds by parameter counts and analyses for very simple models (decision stumps). Formalizing the Rademacher complexity bound, also known as the uniform law of large numbers, requires substantial development and is achieved for the first time in this study. In the course of development, we formalize the Rademacher complexity and its unique arguments such as symmetrization, and clarify the topological assumptions on hypothesis classes under which the bound holds. As an application, we also present the formalization of generalization error bound for $L^2$-regularization models.

Safely navigating around obstacles while respecting the dynamics, control, and geometry of the underlying system is a key challenge in robotics. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) generate safe control policies by considering system dynamics and geometry when calculating safe forward-invariant sets. Existing CBF-based methods often rely on conservative shape approximations, like spheres or ellipsoids, which have explicit and differentiable distance functions. In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles. Inspired by the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we formulate both (i) minimum distance and (ii) penetration depth between polytopic sets as convex optimization problems in the space of Minkowski difference operations (the MD-space). Convenient geometric properties of the MD-space enable the derivatives of implicit SDF between two polytopes to be computed via differentiable optimization. We demonstrate the proposed framework in three scenarios including pure translation, initialization inside an unsafe set, and multi-obstacle avoidance. These three scenarios highlight the generation of a non-conservative maneuver, a recovery after starting in collision, and the consideration of multiple obstacles via pairwise CBF constraint, respectively.

Orthonormalized updates accelerate training, improve stability, and enable robust hyperparameter transfer, but existing methods like Muon rely on dense matrix operations that clash with sharded weights in large-scale LLM training, causing high compute and communication cost. We introduce Dion (Distributed Orthonormalization), a scalable and efficient update rule that replaces Newton-Schulz iteration with amortized power iteration on a momentum buffer, avoiding full-matrix reconstruction and integrating cleanly with weight sharding. The rank-fraction parameter with error feedback enables low-rank updates that balance quality with significant cost savings. On language models from 160M to 3B parameters, Dion retains the benefits of orthonormalized updates, while markedly reducing wall-clock time at scale, making it a practical optimizer for next-generation foundation models.

We provide an implementation, momtrop, and apply it to a series of relevant integrals from the loop-tree duality framework. Compared to naive sampling methods, we observe convergence speedups by factors of more than $10^6$.

The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.

Gapped Boundaries of Kitaev's Quantum Double Models: A Lattice Realization of Anyon Condensation from Lagrangian Algebras

The macroscopic theory of anyon condensation, rooted in the categorical structure of topological excitations, provides a complete classification of gapped boundaries in topologically ordered systems, where distinct boundaries correspond to the condensation of different Lagrangian algebras. However, an intrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models, grounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries of Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian algebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in the quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the anyon-creating picture and the anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to the boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators that respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras. Solving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary interactions required to realize gapped boundaries. We also provide three families of solutions that cover a broad range of cases. Our construction provides a microscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation dynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms are supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies on pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad applicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be generalized to planar topological codes, extended string-net models, or higher-dimensional topologically ordered systems.

Fast Fourier Transform-Based Spectral and Temporal Gradient Filtering for Differential Privacy

Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a key framework for protecting sensitive data in machine learning, but standard DP-SGD often suffers from significant accuracy loss due to injected noise. To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.

Accelerated first-passage dynamics in a non-Markovian feedback Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process

We study the first-passage dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the particle drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we calculate the leading order asymptotics of the time-dependent distribution of the particle position, derive the most probable paths that reach the specified position at a given time and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean first-passage time, and show that the feedback accelerates dynamics by storing finite-time fluctuations, thereby lowering the effective energy barrier and shifting the optimal first-passage time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate the dynamics. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control first-passage dynamics.

Kernel Embeddings and the Separation of Measure Phenomenon
Leonardo V. Santoro, Kartik G. Waghmare, Victor M. Panaretos
Subjects:

We prove that kernel covariance embeddings lead to information-theoretically perfect separation of distinct probability distributions. In statistical terms, we establish that testing for the equality of two probability measures on a compact and separable metric space is equivalent to testing for the singularity between two centered Gaussian measures on a reproducing kernel Hilbert Space. The corresponding Gaussians are defined via the notion of kernel covariance embedding of a probability measure, and the Hilbert space is that generated by the embedding kernel. Distinguishing singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an information-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing, particularly in complex or high-dimensional domains. This is because singular Gaussians are supported on essentially separate and affine subspaces. Our proof leverages the classical Feldman-Hajek dichotomy, and shows that even a small perturbation of a distribution will be maximally magnified through its Gaussian embedding. This ``separation of measure phenomenon'' appears to be a blessing of infinite dimensionality, by means of embedding, with the potential to inform the design of efficient inference tools in considerable generality. The elicitation of this phenomenon also appears to crystallize, in a precise and simple mathematical statement, the outstanding empirical effectiveness of the so-called ``kernel trick".

A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit is the large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$ subject to scaling limit, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. Such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background. The scaling limit can be interpreted as non- or hyper-relativistic limit.

Whether an almost-commuting pair of operators must be close to a commuting pair is a central question in operator and matrix theory. We investigate this problem for pairs of $C^*$-subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ of $M_d(\mathbb{C})$, showing that each operator in $\mathcal{B}$ is $O(d^2\epsilon)$-close in operator norm to an operator in the commutant $\mathcal{A}'$ under two complementary formulations of "$\epsilon$-almost commutation." One formulation is probabilistic, requiring that the operators of $\mathcal{B}$ have small commutators for most Haar-random unitaries acting on $\mathcal{A}$. This first formulation leads to two novel probabilistic generalizations of Stampfli's theorem, which relates an operator's distance from the scalars to the norm of its inner derivation. The second formulation is deterministic, requiring small commutators between the generators of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$; we analyze this using an approximate Schur's lemma formulated in terms of Weyl-Heisenberg (clock-and-shift) matrices. As an application of our results to quantum information theory, we obtain a quantitative Tsirelson's theorem: in dimension $d$, every $\epsilon$-almost quantum commuting observable model is well approximated by a quantum tensor-product model with error $O(d^2\epsilon)$.

Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

Markov dualities via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors

Subjects:

The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues.

On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries

The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we derive an explicit formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions and prove its uniform convergence on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive method for computing Koopman eigenfunctions.

We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed Lévy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of Lévy flights in steep potential landscapes.

Higher-order Gini indices: An axiomatic approach
Xia Han, Ruodu Wang, Qinyu Wu
Subjects:

Via an axiomatic approach, we characterize the family of n-th order Gini deviation, defined as the expected range over n independent draws from a distribution, to quantify joint dispersion across multiple observations. This family extends the classical Gini deviation, which relies solely on pairwise comparisons. The normalized version is called a high-order Gini coefficient. The generalized indices grow increasingly sensitive to tail inequality as n increases, offering a more nuanced view of distributional extremes. The higher-order Gini deviations admit a Choquet integral representation, inheriting the desirable properties of coherent deviation measures. Furthermore, we show that both the n-th order Gini deviation and the n-th order Gini coefficient are statistically n-observation elicitable, allowing for direct computation through empirical risk minimization. Data analysis using World Inequality Database data reveals that higher-order Gini coefficients capture disparities that the classical Gini coefficient may fail to reflect, particularly in cases of extreme income or wealth concentration.

The statistics community, which has traditionally lacked a transparent and open peer-review system, faces a challenge of inconsistent paper quality, with some published work containing substantial errors. This problem resonates with concerns raised by Schaeffer et al. (2025) regarding the rapid growth of machine learning research. They argue that peer review has proven insufficient to prevent the publication of ``misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies'' and that a ``dynamic self-correcting research ecosystem'' is needed. This note provides a concrete illustration of this problem by examining two published papers, Wang, Zhou and Lin (2025) and Liu et al. (2023), and exposing striking and critical errors in their proofs. The presence of such errors in major journals raises a fundamental question about the importance and verification of mathematical proofs in our field. Echoing the proposal from Schaeffer et al. (2025), we argue that reforming the peer-review system itself is likely impractical. Instead, we propose a more viable path forward: the creation of a high-profile, reputable platform, such as a ``Refutations and Critiques'' track on arXiv, to provide visibility to vital research that critically challenges prior work. Such a mechanism would be crucial for enhancing the reliability and credibility of statistical research.

We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.

Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy

For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
\exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
\exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.

We study a noncooperative $n$-player game of slack allocation in which each player $j$ has entitlement $L_j>0$ and chooses a claim $C_j\ge0$. Let $v_j=(C_j-L_j)_+$ (overage) and $s_j=(L_j-C_j)_+$ (slack); set $X=\sum_j v_j$ and $I=\sum_j s_j$. At the end of the period an overage-proportional clearing rule allocates cooperative surplus $I$ to defectors in proportion to $v_j$; cooperators receive $C_j$. We show: (i) the selfish outcome reproduces the cooperative payoff vector $(L_1,\dots,L_n)$; (ii) with bounded actions, defection is a weakly dominant strategy; (iii) within the $\alpha$-power family, the linear rule ($\alpha=1$) is the unique boundary-continuous member; and (iv) the dominant-strategy outcome is Strong Nash under transferable utility and hence coalition-proof (Bernheim et al., 1987). We give a policy interpretation for carbon rationing with a penalty collar.

Emerging Technologies (cs.ET); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) technology has been proposed to enhance the performance of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. However, within 6DMA-related research, studies on the ISAC system based on rotatable array (RA) remains relatively limited. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on a channel model that accounts for the efficiency of the antenna radiation pattern and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user RA-aided ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) method, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) framework, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. For the analog beamforming optimization subproblem, we adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method to transform the objective function, thereby deriving the closed-form update expression for the analog beamforming matrix. For the antenna rotation optimization subproblem, we derive the closed-form derivative expression of the array rotation angle and propose a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RA-aided hybrid beamforming design method. It not only significantly improves the overall system performance while reducing hardware costs, but also achieves performance comparable to that of the fully-digital beamforming design with fixed-position antennas (FPA) under specific parameter configurations.

Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed. The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: this http URL

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper introduces the Intrinsic Dimension Estimating Autoencoder (IDEA), which identifies the underlying intrinsic dimension of a wide range of datasets whose samples lie on either linear or nonlinear manifolds. Beyond estimating the intrinsic dimension, IDEA is also able to reconstruct the original dataset after projecting it onto the corresponding latent space, which is structured using re-weighted double CancelOut layers. Our key contribution is the introduction of the projected reconstruction loss term, guiding the training of the model by continuously assessing the reconstruction quality under the removal of an additional latent dimension. We first assess the performance of IDEA on a series of theoretical benchmarks to validate its robustness. These experiments allow us to test its reconstruction ability and compare its performance with state-of-the-art intrinsic dimension estimators. The benchmarks show good accuracy and high versatility of our approach. Subsequently, we apply our model to data generated from the numerical solution of a vertically resolved one-dimensional free-surface flow, following a pointwise discretization of the vertical velocity profile in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, and time. IDEA succeeds in estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension and then reconstructs the original solution by working directly within the projection space identified by the network.

Vendi Information Gain for Active Learning and its Application to Ecology
Quan Nguyen, Adji Bousso Dieng
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Information Theory (cs.IT); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
While monitoring biodiversity through camera traps has become an important endeavor for ecological research, identifying species in the captured image data remains a major bottleneck due to limited labeling resources. Active learning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data to label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but typically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without considering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active learning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on their impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both informativeness and diversity. We applied VIG to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset and compared it against common active learning methods. VIG needs only 3% of the available data to reach 75\% accuracy, a level that baselines require more than 10% of the data to achieve. With 10% of the data, VIG attains 88\% predictive accuracy, 12% higher than the best of the baselines. This improvement in performance is consistent across metrics and batch sizes, and we show that VIG also collects more diverse data in the feature space. VIG has broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for biodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments.
