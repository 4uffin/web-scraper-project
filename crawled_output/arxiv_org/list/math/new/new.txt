Title:
Distinguishability of causal structures under latent confounding and selection
Ryan Carey, Marina Maciel Ansanelli, Elie Wolfe, Robin J. Evans

26 pages, 16 figures
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Statistical relationships in observed data can arise for several different reasons: the observed variables may be causally related, they may share a latent common cause, or there may be selection bias. Each of these scenarios can be modelled using different causal graphs. Not all such causal graphs, however, can be distinguished by experimental data. In this paper, we formulate the equivalence class of causal graphs as a novel graphical structure, the selected-marginalized directed graph (smDG). That is, we show that two directed acyclic graphs with latent and selected vertices have the same smDG if and only if they are indistinguishable, even when allowing for arbitrary interventions on the observed variables. As a substitute for the more familiar d-separation criterion for DAGs, we provide an analogous sound and complete separation criterion in smDGs for conditional independence relative to passive observations. Finally, we provide a series of sufficient conditions under which two causal structures are indistinguishable when there is only access to passive observations.

Title:
The arithmetic rank of determinantal nullcones
Jack Jeffries, Vaibhav Pandey, Anurag K. Singh, Uli Walther
Comments:
Preliminary version; comments welcome
Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We compute the arithmetic rank of nullcone ideals arising from the classical actions of the symplectic group, the general linear group, and the orthogonal group. We use these arithmetic rank calculations to establish striking vanishing results on the local cohomology modules supported at these nullcone ideals. This is done by analyzing the integer torsion in the critical local cohomology modules. The vanishing theorems that we obtain are sharp in multiple ways.

On the Onsager-Machlup functional of the $Φ^4$-measure
Ioannis Gasteratos, Zachary Selk
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the existence of generalised densities for the $\Phi^4_d$ $(d=1,2,3)$ measures, in finite volume, through the lens of Onsager-Machlup (OM) functionals. The latter are rigorously defined for measures on metric spaces as limiting ratios of small ball probabilities. In one dimension, we show that the standard OM functional of the $\Phi^4_1$ measure coincides with the $\Phi^4$ action as expected. In two dimensions, we show that OM functionals of the $P(\Phi)_2$ measures agree with the corresponding actions, by considering ``enhanced" distances, defined with respect to Wick powers of the Gaussian Free Field, which are analogous to rough path metrics. In dimension $3$, two natural generalisations of the OM functional are proved to be degenerate. Finally, we recover the $\Phi^4_3$ action, under appropriate regularity conditions, by considering joint small radius-large frequency limits.

Rectangle partitions generalizing integer partitions
Krystian Gajdzica, Robin Visser, Maciej Zakarczemny
Comments:
23 Pages, 4 Figures, 2 Tables
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)
In this paper, we introduce a natural geometric extension of the partition function. More precisely, we investigate the problem of counting partitions of a rectangle into rectangular blocks with integer sides. Here, two partitions of a rectangle are indistinguishable if they consist of the same multiset of blocks -- their geometric arrangement does not matter.

Kernel Radon-Nikodym Derivatives for Random Matrix Ensembles
James Tian
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Operator Algebras (math.OA); Probability (math.PR)
We study random operator tuples and random matrix ensembles through positive definite kernels, conditional expectations, and dilation theory. A Radon-Nikodym theorem for kernels is established, showing how domination can be expressed by explicit density operators. For shifted kernels this reduces to simple moment-ratio tests. In bi-unitarily invariant and block-invariant ensembles, these criteria align with classical asymptotics such as the Marchenko-Pastur law, offering a clear and efficient way to detect threshold phenomena.

Increased lifespan for 3D compressible Euler flows with rotation
Haram Ko, Benoit Pausader, Ryo Takada, Klaus Widmayer
Comments:
40 pages, comments are welcome
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the compressible Euler equation with a Coriolis term and prove a lower bound on the time of existence of solutions in terms of the speed of rotation, sound speed and size of the initial data. Along the way, we obtain precise dispersive decay estimates for the linearized equation. In the incompressible limit, this improves current bounds for the incompressible Euler-Coriolis system as well.

Scaled Arndt Compositions
Brian Hopkins, Augustine Munagi
Comments:
5 pages, 3 tables
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Integer compositions restricted by inequalities on certain pairs of parts were first considered by Jörg Arndt in 2013 and several variations have been studied recently. Here we consider a broad two-parameter generalization that scales the defining relation. We connect these to compositions restricted to parts from certain congruence classes and establish the recurrence relations satisfied by the related counting sequences. This provides new combinatorial interpretations to several documented integer sequences and also simple unrecorded sequences. We conclude with suggestions for further study.

Title:
A robust framework for frictional fault contact in geological formations using a stabilized augmented Lagrangian approach
Matteo Frigo, Nicola Castelletto, Matteo Cusini, Randolph R. Settgast, Hamdi A. Tchelepi
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Numerical simulations are essential for evaluating the performance and safety of geological engineered systems such as geologic carbon storage sites, enhanced geothermal fields, and oil and gas reservoirs. A key challenge lies in accurately modeling the frictional contact behavior along fault surfaces. This problem involves inequality constraints that arise from the physics of frictional slip, requiring specialized numerical methods to handle the resulting highly nonlinear and path-dependent behavior. In this work, we address this challenge using an augmented Lagrangian method implemented via the Uzawa algorithm. The formulation employs mixed finite element spaces, combining low-order piecewise linear displacements within the 3D domain cells with piecewise constant tractions defined on the fault surfaces. Furthermore, to ensure stability and satisfy the inf-sup condition, the discrete displacement space is enriched with face bubble functions on both sides of the contact interfaces. This approach offers several advantages over other stabilization techniques that rely on additional terms, as it does not require extra parameters for implementation, and it integrates naturally in the Uzawa framework.

A notion of quasi-convex subgroups in acylindrically hyperbolic groups
Ping Wan
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
In this paper, we present a notion of quasiconvexity in the setting of finitely-generated groups with hyperbolically embedded subgroups. Our main result shows that this notion yields uniform quasiconvex constants in the setting of coned-off cusped spaces. We also prove that this notion of quasiconvexity is preserved under sufficiently long Dehn filling. As an application, we generalize a theorem of Groves-Manning on groups acting on $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes.

Title:
The Sturm-Liouville Hierarchy of evolution equations and the Weyl functions of related spectral problems
Paola Rubbioni, Anna Rita Sambucini, Luca Zampogni
Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
The goal of the present paper is that of defining the so-called Sturm-Liouville hierarchy of evolution equations, firstly by using the zero-curvature formalism, then by using the asymptotic properties of the Weyl $m$-functions for certain classes of pairs $(q,y)$ of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation $$-\varphi''+q\varphi=\lambda y\varphi,$$ in the space $L^2(\mathbb R,ydx)$. Since the Weyl $m$-functions are known to contain all the information concerning the spectral properties of the above equation, the determination of the evolution of some spectral characteristics will allow to determine solutions of the hierarchies of evolution equations.

Title:
Composition Direction of Seymour's Theorem for Regular Matroids -- Formally Verified
Martin Dvorak, Tristan Figueroa-Reid, Rida Hamadani, Byung-Hak Hwang, Evgenia Karunus, Vladimir Kolmogorov, Alexander Meiburg, Alexander Nelson, Peter Nelson, Mark Sandey, Ivan Sergeev

Combinatorics (math.CO); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)
Seymour's decomposition theorem is a hallmark result in matroid theory presenting a structural characterization of the class of regular matroids. Formalization of matroid theory faces many challenges, most importantly that only a limited number of notions and results have been implemented so far. In this work, we formalize the proof of the forward (composition) direction of Seymour's theorem for regular matroids. To this end, we develop a library in Lean 4 that implements definitions and results about totally unimodular matrices, vector matroids, their standard representations, regular matroids, and 1-, 2-, and 3-sums of matrices and binary matroids given by their standard representations. Using this framework, we formally state Seymour's decomposition theorem and implement a formally verified proof of the composition direction in the setting where the matroids have finite rank and may have infinite ground sets.

On the Landis Conjecture for Positive Quasi-linear Operators on Graphs
Ujjal Das, Matthias Keller, Yehuda Pinchover
Comments:
15 pages
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We prove a Landis type unique continuation result for positive quasi-linear operators on graphs. Specifically, we give decay criteria that ensures when a harmonic function for a positive quasilinear Schrödinger operator with potential less than 1 is trivially zero. The assumption of positivity of the operator allows the application of criticality theory such as the Liouville comparison theorem. Furthermore, our results fundamentally build on the so called simplified energy. As an application we discuss the case of model graphs and in particular regular trees.

Judicious partitions for restricted self-sumsets in cyclic groups
Keane Maverick Irawan
Comments:
10 pages, 0 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)
We study the minimax problem for restricted two-fold self-sumsets in $k$-colorings of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. For primes $p$ with $2\le k\le p$ we determine the exact minimum $\max\{0,\,2\lceil p/k\rceil-3\}$. For general $n$ (with $m=\lceil n/k\rceil$) we bound the optimum between a size term $\min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$ and a periodicity term $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)$, and show these bounds are tight when $2m-3\le p(n)$ or $f\big(n/q(n,k)\big)\le \min\{p(n),\,2m-3\}$. We further prove a stability inequality and a threshold theorem that force concentration in a single subgroup coset near the periodic scale. In the prime case with $m\ge 5$ and $2m-3<p$, every optimal coloring contains a class of size $m$ that is an arc (an arithmetic progression up to an affine automorphism). Our approach combines the restricted Erdős--Heilbronn phenomenon with block/coset colorings and an injectivity window.

Burning games on strong path products
Sally Ambrose, Evan Angelone, Jacob Chen, Daniel Ma, Arturo Ortiz San Miguel, Wraven Watanabe, Stephen Whitcomb, Shanghao Wu
Comments:
10 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Burning and cooling are diffusion processes on graphs in which burned (or cooled) vertices spread to their neighbors with a new source picked at discrete time steps. In burning, the one tries to burn the graph as fast as possible, while in cooling one wants to delay cooling as long as possible.
We consider $d$-fold strong products of paths, which generalize king graphs. The propagation of these graphs is radial, and models local spread of contagion in an arbitrary number of dimensions. We reduce the problem to a geometric tiling problem to obtain a bound for the burning number of a strong product of paths by a novel use of an Euler-Maclaurin formula, which is sharp under certain number theoretic conditions.
Additionally, we consider liminal burning, which is a two-player perfect knowledge game played on graphs related to the effectiveness of controlled spread of contagion throughout a network. We introduce and study the number $k^*$, the smallest $k$ such that $b_{k}(G) = b(G)$.

Title:
Extended Sobolev Scale on Non-Compact Manifolds
Ognjen Milatovic
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Adapting the definition of ``extended Sobolev scale" on compact manifolds by Mikhailets and Murach to the setting of a (generally non-compact) manifold of bounded geometry $X$, we define the ``extended Sobolev scale" $H^{\varphi}(X)$, where $\varphi$ is a function which is $RO$-varying at infinity. With the help of the scale $H^{\varphi}(X)$, we obtain a description of all Hilbert function-spaces that serve as interpolation spaces with respect to a pair of Sobolev spaces $[H^{(s_0)}(X), H^{(s_1)}(X)]$, with $s_0<s_1$. We use this interpolation property to establish a mapping property of proper uniform pseudo-differential operators (PUPDOs) in the context of the scale $H^{\varphi}(X)$. Additionally, using a first-order positive-definite PUPDO $A$ of elliptic type we define the ``extended $A$-scale" $H^{\varphi}_{A}(X)$ and show that it coincides, up to norm equivalence, with the scale $H^{\varphi}(X)$. Besides the mentioned results, we show that further properties of the $H^{\varphi}$-scale, originally established by Mikhailets and Murach on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and on compact manifolds, carry over to manifolds of bounded geometry.

In this paper, we showed that the adjoint polynomial of a polyhedral cone equals the multidegree polynomial of the toric ideal with multigrading, both given by the vertex rays. This fact implies a conjecture of Aluffi, to the effect that the adjoint polynomial of a polyhedral cone in the positive orthant is a covolume polynomial.

Symplectic Isospectral Runge--Kutta Methods as Lie group methods
Paolo Cifani, Klas Modin, Cecilia Pagliantini, Milo Viviani
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we compare three different approaches for a conservative integration in time of isospectral flows on quadratic Lie algebras.
We show that it is possible to choose an equivalent formulation of the original isospectral flow such that, applying a symplectic Runge--Kutta method, the resulting scheme is both conservative and computationally more efficient than other schemes previously proposed.
In particular, in the case of Hamiltonian systems, we get arbitrarily high-order Lie--Poisson integrators on quadratic Lie algebras.

The unavoidable drawings of complete multipartite graphs
Jozsef Balogh, Irene Parada, Gelasio Salazar
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In a simple drawing of a graph every pair of edges intersect each other in at most one point, which is either a common endvertex or a proper crossing. For each positive integer $n$, Negami identified a drawing $B_n$ of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, and proved that if $N$ is sufficiently large, then every drawing of $K_{N,N}$ contains a drawing of $K_{n,n}$ weakly isomorphic to $B_n$. Thus $B_n$ is (up to weak isomorphism) the only {\em unavoidable} drawing of $K_{n,n}$. We extend this result to complete multipartite graphs, characterizing their unavoidable drawings.

Affine Hulls and Simplices: a Constructive Analysis
Douglas S. Bridges
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
This paper deals with certain fundamental results about affine hulls and simplices in a real normed linear space. The framework of the paper is Bishop's constructive mathematics, which, with its characteristic interpretation of existence as constructibility, often involves more subtle estimation than its classical-logic-based counterpart. As well as technically more involved proofs (for example, that of Theorem 29 on the perturbation of vertices), we have included a number of elementary ones for completeness of exposition.

Scaling limit for Brownian motions on the $l$-level Sierpinski gaskets: The fractal to Euclidean crossover
David A. Croydon, Ben Hambly, Takashi Kumagai
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In two dimensions, the $l$-level Sierpinski gasket $\mathrm{SG}(l)$ is obtained by splitting an equilateral triangle into a collection of $l^2$ equilateral triangles of equal size and with the same total area, retaining only the $l(l+1)/2$ triangles with the same orientation as the original triangle, and then iterating this procedure indefinitely. We show that the canonical diffusions on the spaces $\mathrm{SG}(l)$, $l\geq2$, can be rescaled to yield Brownian motion on the initial triangle. Our argument also applies to the analogous higher-dimensional Sierpinski gaskets. Moreover, we prove a local central limit theorem for the associated transition densities. Key to this is the derivation of a Poincaré inequality, in the proof of which we exploit the Euclidean-type mixing that occurs between the bottlenecks present at each scale of the fractal.

A Deep Transfer Learning-Based Low-overhead Beam Prediction in Vehicle Communications
Zhiqiang Xiao, Yuwen Cao, Mondher Bouazizi, Tomoaki Ohtsuki, Shahid Mumtaz
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Existing transfer learning-based beam prediction approaches primarily rely on simple fine-tuning. When there is a significant difference in data distribution between the target domain and the source domain, simple fine-tuning limits the model's performance in the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based beam prediction method that combines fine-tuning with domain adaptation. We integrate a domain classifier into fine-tuning the pre-trained model. The model extracts domain-invariant features in adversarial training with domain classifier, which can enhance model performance in the target domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transfer learning-based beam prediction method achieves better achievable rate performance than the pure fine-tuning method in the target domain, and close to those when the training is done from scratch on the target domain.

Bohr-Type Inequalities for Fractional Differential and Integral Operators

Comments:

Subjects:
Complex Variables (math.CV)
We study Bohr type inequalities within the framework of fractional calculus. Using Riemann Liouville fractional differential and integral operators, we establish generalized Bohr radii for analytic functions in the unit disk, including the classes of univalent, convex, and Bloch functions. The results unify earlier cases, recover the classical Bohr inequality as a limiting instance, and show how the Bohr radius decreases with the fractional order. Numerical computations further illustrate how the radii vary with the fractional order, highlighting the transition from the classical to the fractional setting.

Four-dimensional Gradient Ricci Solitons Gradient shrinking Ricci Solitons and Modified Sectional Curvature

Comments:
21 pages, comments welcomed
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We investigate four-dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with positive modified sectional curvature. Our first main result shows that if the norm of the self-dual Weyl tensor and the scalar curvature satisfy a certain sharp pinching condition --closely related, in a precise sense, to that of Kähler metric --then the soliton is necessarily locally Kähler. We further obtain a characterization theorem and a weighted integral gap result for compact gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with bounded modified sectional curvature. In addition, we establish a Hitchin-Thorpe type inequality for compact four-dimensional Ricci solitons, providing new topological constraints on such manifolds.

On Pauling's residual entropy estimate for regular graphs with growing degree
M. Hasheminezhad, M. Isaev, B. D. McKay, R-R. Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In 1935, Pauling proposed an estimate for the number of Eulerian orientations of a graph in the context of the theoretical behaviour of water ice. The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, normalised by the number of vertices, is called the residual entropy. In an earlier paper, we conjectured that the residual entropy of a sequence of regular graphs of increasing degree was asymptotically equal to Pauling's estimate. Here we prove the conjecture under constraints on the number of short circuits. These constraints hold under weak eigenvalue conditions and apply to sequences of increasing girth and repeated Cartesian products such as hypercubes.

A Morse complex for the homology of vanishing cycles

Comments:
29 pages. Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We construct Morse homology groups associated with any regular function on a smooth complex algebraic variety, allowing singular and non-compact critical loci. These groups are generated by critical points of a certain large pertubation of the function, built from a normal crossing compactification of the variety. They are canonically isomorphic to the homology of vanishing cycles and -- in the absence of bifurcations at infinity -- recover the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles, studied extensively in singularity theory and enumerative geometry. Our construction arises as a special case of a more general construction of Morse homology of non-compact manifolds that admit a compactification by a manifold with corners.

The LLN and CLT for the statistical ensembles of discrete integrable Hamiltonian systems
Xinyu Liu, Xinze Zhang, Yong Li
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper investigates the behavior of statistical ensembles under iteration map induced by discrete integrable Hamiltonian systems in deterministic case and stochastic case, addressing the problem from two perspectives: the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. In deterministic case, the Law of Large Numbers simplifies the convergence conditions to the extent that the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma is no longer required. In the stochastic setting, we extend the results to general stochastic processes, beginning with the perturbation term represented by standard Brownian motion. Moreover, we establish a Central Limit Theorem for the statistical ensemble. A numerical example is also included.

A domain decomposition method for computing the scattering matrix of waveguide circuits
Tristan Goodwill, Shidong Jiang, Manas Rachh, Kosuke Sugita
Comments:
22 pages, 9 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Optics (physics.optics)
We analyze and develop numerical methods for time-harmonic wave scattering in metallic waveguide structures of infinite extent. We show that radiation boundary conditions formulated via projectors onto outgoing modes determine the coefficients of propagating modes uniquely, even when the structure supports trapped modes. Building on this, we introduce a fast divide-and-conquer solver that constructs solution operators on subdomains as impedance-to-impedance maps and couples them by enforcing continuity conditions across their interfaces. For Dirichlet waveguides, the computation of impedance-to-impedance maps requires the solution of mixed Dirichlet-Impedance boundary value problems. We construct a second-kind Fredholm integral equation that avoids near-hypersingular operators, requiring only integral operators whose kernels are at most weakly singular. Numerical experiments on large structures with many circuit elements demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: the proposed approach typically outperforms state-of-the-art fast iterative and fast direct solvers by one to two orders of magnitude.

The arithmetic properties of the second order mock theta function $\mathcal{B}(q)$, introduced by McIntosh, defined by \begin{equation*}
\mathcal{B}(q) := \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{q^n (-q;q^2)_n}{(q;q^2)_{n+1}} = \sum_{n \geq 0}b(n)q^n, \end{equation*} have been extensively studied. For instance, for all $n\ge0$, Kaur and Rana established congruences such as for all $n\ge0$, \begin{align*}
b(12n+10) &\equiv 0 \pmod{36}, \quad
b(18n+16) \equiv 0 \pmod{72}, \end{align*} Chen and Mao proved that for all $n\ge0$, \begin{align*}
b(4n+1) &\equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \quad
b(4n+2) \equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \end{align*} while Mao also showed that for all $n\ge0$, \begin{align*}
b(6n+2) &\equiv 0 \pmod{4}, \quad
b(6n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{9}. \end{align*} In this paper, we find new congruences and infinite families of congruences modulo $2, 4, 8, 36, 54, 72$ for the function $\mathcal{B}(q)$. For example, let $p \geq 5$ be a prime, if $\left(\frac{-3}{p}\right)_L = -1$, then for all $n, k \geq 0$ with $p \nmid n$, we have \begin{equation*}
b\left( 3p^{2k+1}n + \frac{p^{2k+2}-1}{2} \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}. \end{equation*} Let $p \geq 5$ be a prime and $1 \leq \ell \leq p - 1$ such that $\left( \frac{12\ell + 9}{p} \right)_L = -1$. Then for all $n, k \geq 0$, we have \begin{equation*}
b\left(6p^{2k+3}n + \frac{3p^{2k+2}(4\ell+3)-1}{2}\right) \equiv 0 \pmod{36}. \end{equation*} Our techniques involve elementary $q$-series and Maple.

Let $A$ be a finite ordered set. Define the ordered set $A^A$ as the set of all maps from $A$ to $A$, ordered pointwise. Let ${}^{A} A$ be the dual of $A^A$.
We prove results in the spirit of Parts~I--III, but now using both $A^A$ and ${}^{A}A$. For example, if \[ \Bigl({}^{{}^{ {}^{ {}^{A}A}A}A}A\Bigr)^{A^{A^{A}}} \] is isomorphic to \[ \Bigl({}^{ {}^{ {}^{ {}^{B}B}B}B}B\Bigr)^{B^{B^{B}}} \] for finite ordered sets $A$ and $B$, then $A$ is isomorphic to $B$.

Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We first generalize the logarithmic tensor category theory of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang to the more general case that the module category for a vertex operator algebra $V$ (more generally a Möbius vertex algebra) might not be closed under the contragredient functor. Then by verifying the assumptions to use this generalization, we obtain that (logarithmic) intertwining operators among $C_{1}$-cofinite grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules satisfy the associativity property (operator product expansion) and the category of $C_{1}$-cofinite grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules has a natural vertex tensor category structure. In particular, this category has a natural braided tensor category structure with a twist.

Local intricacy and average sample complexity for amenable group actions
J. Huang, Z. Xiao
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Let $(X,G)$, $(Y,G)$ be two $G$-systems, where $G$ is an infinite countable discrete amenable group and $X$, $Y$ are compact metric spaces. Suppose that $\mathcal{U}$ is a cover of $X$. We first introduce the conditional local topological intricacy $\mathrm{Int}_\mathrm{top} (G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ and average sample complexity $\mathrm{Asc}_\mathrm{top} (G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$. Given an invariant measure $\mu$ of $X$, we study the conditional local measure-theoretical intricacy $\mathrm{Int}_\mu^\pm(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ and average sample complexity $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^\pm(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$. For any Følner sequence $\{F_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, we take $\{c^{F_n}_S\}_{S\subseteq F_n}$ to be the uniform system of coefficients. We establish the equivalence of $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^-(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ and $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^+(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ when $G=\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, we verified that $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^-(G,\mathcal{U})$ is equal to $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^+(G,\mathcal{U})$ in general case. Finally, we give a local variational principle of average sample complexity.

Synthesis of optimization algorithms typically follows a {\em design-then-analyze\/} approach, which can obscure fundamental performance limits and hinder the systematic development of algorithms that operate near these limits. Recently, a framework grounded in robust control theory has emerged as a powerful tool for automating algorithm synthesis. By integrating design and analysis stages, fundamental performance bounds are revealed and synthesis of algorithms that achieve them is enabled. In this paper, we apply this framework to design algorithms for solving strongly convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints. Our approach yields a single-loop, gradient-based algorithm whose convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the constraint matrix. This improves upon the best known rate within the same algorithm class, which depends on the product of the condition numbers of the objective function and the constraint matrix.

State-Constrained Chemical Reactions: Discrete-to-Continuous Hamilton--Jacobi Equations and Large Deviations
Yuan Gao, Yuxi Han
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Probability (math.PR)
We study the macroscopic behavior of chemical reactions modeled as random time-changed Poisson processes on discrete state spaces. Using the WKB reformulation, the backward equation of the rescaled process leads to a discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation with state constraints. As the grid size tends to zero, the limiting solution and its associated variational representation are closely connected to the good rate function of the large deviation principle for state-constrained chemical reactions in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we focus on the limiting behavior of discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equations defined on bounded domains with state-constraint boundary conditions. For a single chemical reaction, we show that, under a suitable reparametrization, the solution of the discrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation converges to the solution of a continuous Hamilton--Jacobi equation with a Neumann boundary condition. Building on this convergence result and the associated variational representation, we establish the large deviation principle for the rescaled chemical reaction process in bounded domains.

$q$-Laplacian State Transfer on Graphs with Involutions
Swornalata Ojha, Hiranmoy Pal
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study the existence of state transfer with respect to the $q$-Laplacian matrix of a graph equipped with a non-trivial involution. We show that the occurrence of perfect state transfer between certain pair (or plus) states in such a graph is equivalent to the existence of vertex state transfer in a subgraph induced by the involution with potentials. This yields infinite families of trees with potentials and unicyclic graphs of maximum degree three that exhibit perfect pair state transfer. In particular, we investigate vertex and pair state transfer in edge-perturbed complete bipartite graphs, cycles, and paths with potentials only at the end vertices.

The odd independence number of graphs, I: Foundations and classical classes
Yair Caro, Mirko Petruševski, Riste Škrekovski, Zsolt Tuza
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
An odd independent set $S$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an independent set of vertices such that, for every vertex $v \in V \setminus S$, either $N(v) \cap S = \emptyset$ or $|N(v) \cap S| \equiv 1$ (mod 2), where $N(v)$ stands for the open neighborhood of $v$. The largest cardinality of odd independent sets of a graph $G$, denoted $\alpha_{od}(G)$, is called the odd independence number of $G$.
This new parameter is a natural companion to the recently introduced strong odd chromatic number. A proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is a strong odd coloring if, for every vertex $v \in V(G)$, each color used in the neighborhood of $v$ appears an odd number of times in $N(v)$. The minimum number of colors in a strong odd coloring of $G$ is denoted by $\chi_{so}(G)$.
A simple relation involving these two parameters and the order $|G|$ of $G$ is $\alpha_{od}(G)\cdot \chi_{so}(G) \geq |G|$, parallel to the same on chromatic number and independence number.
We develop several basic inequalities concerning $\alpha_{od}(G)$, and use already existing results on strong odd coloring, to derive lower bounds for odd independence in many families of graphs.
We prove that $\alpha_{od}(G) = \alpha(G^2)$ holds for all claw-free graphs $G$, and present many results, using various techniques, concerning the odd independence number of cycles, paths, Moore graphs, Kneser graphs, the complete subdivision $S(K_n)$ of $K_n$, the half graphs $H_{n,n}$, and $K_p \Box K_q$. Further, we consider the odd independence number of the hypercube $Q_d$ and also of the complements of triangle-free graphs. Many open problems for future research are stated.

A Convergent Structure-Preserving Scheme for Dissipative Solutions of the Rotating Shallow Water System
K.R. Arun, A. Krishnamurthy
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We design and analyse a semi-implicit finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional rotating shallow water (RSW) equations that is energy stable, well-balanced (capable of preserving discrete geostrophic steady states), consistent, and covergent. The key idea is the introduction of carefully chosen stabilisation terms into the convective fluxes of the mass and momentum equations, as well as the source terms. Under a CFL-type condition, together with an auxiliary time-step restriction arising from the Coriolis forces, we establish the energy stability of the scheme. The stabilisation terms are constructed to vanish at steady states, thereby ensuring the well-balancing property under an appropriate advective CFL condition. We derive a sufficient time-step restriction that guarantees stability, well-balancing, existence of discrete solutions, and positivity simultaneously. Furthermore, under mild boundedness assumptions, we obtain a priori estimates showing that the stabilisation terms converge to zero as the mesh is refined, which establishes the consistency of the scheme. This in turn enables us to prove that numerical solutions generate a Young measure, identifiable as a dissipative measure-valued solution of the RSW system, thereby yielding convergence of the scheme. Finally, we confirm the theoretical results through extensive numerical experiments.

Mutually Abelian-Bordered Binary Words
Anuran Maity, K. V. Krishna
Subjects:

A word is said to be bordered if it contains a nonempty proper prefix that is also a suffix. A pair of words $(u, v)$ is said to be mutually bordered if there exists a word that is a nonempty proper prefix of $u$ and suffix of $v$, and there exists a word that is a nonempty proper suffix of $u$ and prefix of $v$. Recently, Gabric studied the number of mutually bordered pairs. In this work, we extend the concept of mutually bordered pairs to abelian setting, and determine the number of mutually abelian-bordered pairs of binary words using lattice paths. We also find the number of unbordered pairs in this context.

Diffusive Scaling limit of stochastic Box-Ball systems and PushTASEP

We introduce the Stochastic Box-Ball System (SBBS), a probabilistic cellular automaton that generalizes the classic Takahashi-Satsuma Box-Ball System. In SBBS, particles are transported by a carrier with a fixed capacity that may fail to pick up any given particle with a fixed probability $\epsilon$. This model interpolates between two known integrable systems: the Box-Ball System (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$) and the PushTASEP (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 1$). We show that the long-term behavior of SBBS is governed by isolated particles and the occasional emergence of short solitons, which can form longer solitons but are more likely to fall apart. More precisely, we first show that all particles are isolated except for a $1/\sqrt{n}$-fraction of times in any given $n$ steps and solitons keep forming for this fraction of times. We then establish the diffusive scaling limit of the associated "gap process," which tracks the distances between consecutive particles. Namely, under diffusive scaling, the gap processes for both SBBS (for any carrier capacity) and PushTASEP converge weakly to Semimartingale Reflecting Brownian Motions (SRBMs) on the non-negative orthant with explicit covariance and reflection matrices consistent with the microscale relations between these systems. Moreover, the reflection matrix for SBBS is determined by how 2-solitons behave. Our proof relies on a new, extended SRBM invariance principle that we develop in this work. This principle can handle processes with complex boundary behavior that can be written as "overdetermined" Skorokhod decompositions involving rectangular reflection matrices, which is crucial for analyzing the complex solitonic boundary behavior of SBBS. We believe this tool may be of independent interest.

In this paper, we introduce the notions of parabolic representation pair variety and relative representation variety of a given parabolic type. We investigate the local behavior of these varieties. The Zariski tangent space and the tangent quadratic cones are described. By the Riemann--Hilbert--Deligne correspondence, we pro-represent the analytic germs of these varieties by functors related to certain groupoids of parabolic logarithmic flat bundles. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the differential graded Lie algebra (DGLA) controlling the deformation of parabolic logarithmic flat bundle is mixedly formal. Finally, we construct the moduli space of weighted parabolic representation pairs, and, by means of quiver representation theory, we establish the Kobayashi--Hitchin-type theorem for polystable parabolic representation pairs.

We interpret the symmetrized weight enumerator of linear codes over finite commutative Frobenius rings as a summation over multisets and thereby provide a new proof of the MacWilliams identity for the symmetrized weight enumerator. The proof and the identity are expressed in combinatorial terms that do not require generating characters. We also generalize the symmetrized weight enumerator with respect to supports and codeword tuples, and our multiset approach enables us to derive new and general MacWilliams identities expressed in combinatorial terms.

For the speed-change exclusion process on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ reversible with respect to the product Bernoulli measure, we prove that its semigroup $P_t$ satisfies a variance decay $\operatorname{Var}[P_t u] = C_u t^{-\frac{d}{2}} + o(t^{-\frac{d+\delta}{2}})$ for every local function $u$, with the constant $C_u$ explicitly characterized. This extends the result of Janvresse, Landim, Quastel and Yau in [Ann. Probab. 27(1) 325--360, 1999] to a non-gradient model. The proof combines the regularization argument in the previous work, and the chaos expansion in [Markov Process. Related Fields, 5(2) 125--162, 1999] by Bertini and Zegarlinski, via a new input from the homogenization theory.

Purity of generalized affine Springer fibers from generic planar curve singularities

We prove the cohomological purity of punctual Hilbert schemes of points on generic irreducible planar curve singularities, by constructing an explicit affine paving. Via their identification with generalized $GL_N$-affine Springer fibers attached to the direct sum of the adjoint and standard representations, this establishes a new case of the purity conjecture for generalized affine Springer fibers. The combinatorics of the paving - cell indices and dimensions - are controlled by $(dn,dm)$-Dyck paths extending results of Gorsky-Mazin-Oblomkov on compactified Jacobians. As a byproduct, we also give a simpler proof of their bijection between admissible $(dn,dm)$-invariant subsets and $(dn,dm)$-Dyck paths.

Complexity of Error Bounds for Systems of Linear Inequalities
Zhou Wei, Michel Thera, Jen-Chih Yao
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Error bounds have been studied for over seventy years, beginning with Hoffman's 1952 result [ J. Res. Natl. Bur. Standards, 49(1952), 263-65], which provided a bound on the distance from any point to the solution set of a linear system. However, little is known about the inherent intractability of error bounds. This paper focuses on the complexity of error bounds and stbaility of error bounds for systems of linear inequalities. For the complexity of error bounds for linear inequalities, we reformulate this problem as the task of solving finitely many min-max problems-defined by certain rows of the given matrix over the sphere and then prove that this problem is not in the class P, but it is in the clathat there exist pseudo-polynomial time algorithms to solve both the error bounds problem and its complement. In particular, the complement is a number problem, but not NP-complete in the strong sense (unless P = NP). For the complexity of stability of error bounds, it is proved that this problem is not in the class P. However, such problem becomes polynomially solvable when the dimension is fixed.

Strictly zero-dimensional biframes and Raney extensions
Anna Laura Suarez
Subjects:
General Topology (math.GN)
Raney extensions and strictly zero-dimensional biframes both faithfully extend the dual of the category of $T_0$ spaces. We use tools from pointfree topology to look at the connection between the two. Raney extensions may be equivalently described as pairs $(L,\mathcal{F})$ where $L$ is a frame and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \mathcal{S}_{o}(L)$ a subcolocale containing all open sublocales. Here, $\mathcal{S}_o(L)$ is the collection of all intersections of open sublocales of $L$. Similarly, a strictly zero-dimensional biframe is a pair $(L,\mathcal{D})$ where $\mathcal{D}\subseteq \mathcal{S}(L)$ is a codense subcolocale. We show that there is an adjunction between certain subcolocales of $\mathcal{S}_o(L)$ and codense subcolocales of $\mathcal{S}(L)$. We show that the adjunction maximally restricts to an order-isomorphism between the subcolocales of $\mathcal{S}_o(L)$ where the joins of open sublocales distribute over binary meets, which we call the proper subcolocales, and what we call the essential codense subcolocales. As an application of our main result, we establish a bijection between proper Raney extensions and the strictly zero-dimensional biframes $(L_1,L_2,L)$ such that $L$ is an essential extension of $L_2$ in the category of frames. We show that this correspondence cannot be made functorial in the obvious way, as a frame morphism $f:L\to M$ may lift to a map $f:(L,\mathcal{F})\to (L,\mathcal{G})$ of Raney extensions without lifting to a map between the associated strictly zero-dimensional biframes.

Birationally integrable vector fields on complex projective surfaces

A rational vector field on a complex projective smooth surface $S$ is said to be birationally integrable if it generates, by integration, a one-parameter subgroup of the group $\operatorname{Bir}(S)$ of birational transformations of $S$. We prove that every birationally integrable vector field is regularizable, i.e. birationally conjugated to a holomorphic vector field. Next, we extend this result to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ of birationally integrable vector fields. This implies that $\mathfrak g$ is naturally included into the Lie algebra of an algebraic subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir}(S)$. Moreover, we obtain a complete birational classification of birationally integrable Lie algebras that are of dimension two or semisimple, exhibiting holomorphic normal forms of them. We also characterize those birationally integrable algebras of rational vector fields that are maximal.

We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.

Our main theorem asserts that cut-and-project systems uniquely attain the minimal intersection covolume. As an application, we characterize the generalized Farey fractions in the finite adeles via their Banach density.

Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The conditions under which a given manifold $M$ may be given a tangent bundle or a cotangent bundle structure are analyzed. This is an important property arising in different contexts. For instance, in the study of integrability of a given dynamics the existence of alternative compatible structures is very relevant, as well as in the geometric approach to Classical Mechanics. On the other hand in the quantum-to-classical transition, a Weyl system plays an important role for it provides (within the so-called Weyl-Wigner formalism) a description of quantum mechanics on a (symplectic) phase-space $M$. A Lagrangian subspace $Q\subset M$ of the (linear) phase space determines thus a maximal set of pairwise commuting unitary operators, which is used to parametrize the quantum states. As the choice of this maximal Abelian set of observables is not unique, the different choices make the phase space to become diffeomorphic to different cotangent bundles $T^*Q$ corresponding to different choices for the base manifold (and hence the fibers). These motivating ideas are used to study how to define alternative tangent and/or cotangent bundle structures on a phase space.

Subjects:

In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover, the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally, several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

Although the picture we present remains largely conjectural, we provide evidence in favour of our conjectures (a) in terms of algebraic $p$-adic $L$-functions, and (b) in endoscopic scenarios.

Root-finding method is an iterative process that constructs a sequence converging to a solution of an equation. Householder's method is a higher-order method that requires higher order derivatives of the reciprocal of a function and has disadvantages. Firstly, symbolic computations can take a long time, and numerical methods to differentiate a function can accumulate errors. Secondly, the convergence factor existing in the literature is a rough estimate. In this paper, we propose a higher-order root-finding method using only Taylor expansion of a function. It has lower computational complexity with explicit convergence factor, and can be used to numerically implement Householder's method. As an application, we apply the proposed method to compute pre-images of $q$-ary entropy functions, commonly seen in coding theory. Finally, we study basins of attraction using the proposed method and compare them with other root-finding methods.

Universal Complexity Bounds for Universal Gradient Methods in Nonlinear Optimization
Yurii Nesterov
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we provide the universal first-order methods of Composite Optimization with new complexity analysis. It delivers some universal convergence guarantees, which are not linked directly to any parametric problem class. However, they can be easily transformed into the rates of convergence for the particular problem classes by substituting the corresponding upper estimates for the Global Curvature Bound of the objective function. We analyze in this way the simple gradient method for nonconvex minimization, gradient methods for convex composite optimization, and their accelerated variant. For them, the only input parameter is the required accuracy of the approximate solution. The accelerated variant of our scheme automatically ensures the best possible rate of convergence simultaneously for all parametric problem classes containing the smooth part of the objective function.

Generalization of the Fisher metric and Completely integrable system on Lie groups SO(2) and SO(3)

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
In this article, we propose a generalization of the Fisher metric within the framework of Souriau's Lie group thermodynamics, focusing on the rotation groups $SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$. We characterize the effect of central 2-cocycles on the information geometry and integrability of gradient systems on the Lie groups SO(2) and SO(3) using the geometry of Jean-Marie Souriau. We also show how a cocycle can locally modify the Fisher metric on a coadjoint orbit, in explicit terms of brackets and central extensions on the Lie groups $SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$. The pioneering works of Fisher, S.I. Amari, Koszul Vinberg, and Souriau have each provided deep but often disjoint perspectives. Our strong motivation is to create a formal bridge between these theories, particularly by integrating Souriau's formalism on Lie group thermodynamics with the more classical structures of information geometry.

Wasserstein Stability of Persistence Landscapes and Barcodes
Wanchen Zhao, Peter Bubenik
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
Barcodes form a complete set of invariants for interval decomposable persistence modules and are an important summary in topological data analysis. The set of barcodes is equipped with a canonical one-parameter family of metrics, the $p-$Wasserstein distances. However, the $p-$Wasserstein distances depend on a choice of a metric on the set of interval modules, and there is no canonical choice. One convention is to use the length of the symmetric difference between 2 intervals, which equals to the 1-norm of the difference between their Hilbert functions. We propose a new metric for interval modules based on the rank invariant instead of the dimension invariant. Our metric is topologically equivalent to the metrics induced by the $p-$norms on $\R^2$. We establish stability results from filtered CW complexes to barcodes, as well as from barcodes to persistence landscapes. In particular, we show that vectorization via persistence landscapes is 1-Lipschitz with a sharp bound, with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance on barcodes and the 1-norm on persistence landscapes.

Complex Lies, Real Physics: The Role of Algebra Complexification

In physics, Lie groups represent the algebraic structure that describes symmetry transformations of a given system. Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\left(\mathfrak{g}^\mathbb{R}\right)_\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathfrak{g} \times \bar{\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\frac{1}{2},0) \oplus (0,\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions. This means that the mathematical group structure determines the material content of the universe following this algebraic structure.

We explore and analyze the use of multiprecision arithmetic for several classes of Schwarz methods and preconditioners, where the approximate solution of the local problems is performed at a lower precision, i.e., with fewer digits of accuracy than in the underlying (double precision) computation. Conditions for the appropriate round-off criteria for the lower precision are presented. It is found experimentally that for the model problems about 5 digits of accuracy are sufficient to achieve the theoretical restrictions, and thus, single precision suffices for the local solves. Several numerical experiments illustrate the obtained results.

Subgroups of the Projective Linear Group Realized by wild Galois Points

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Group Theory (math.GR)
We work over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. This paper investigates linear representations of Galois groups arising from wild Galois points on projective hypersurfaces. We prove that these Galois groups lift to the general linear group and act naturally on vector spaces. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subgroups of the projective linear group to be realized as Galois groups of wild Galois points. In addition, we show that projections from wild Galois points on normal hypersurfaces are necessarily wildly ramified. We provide a geometric criterion for detecting wild ramification via the fixed loci of birational automorphisms, linking group-theoretic properties to the geometry of the hypersurface.

We show that the number of irreducible components of a general fibre of $S\to Z$ is bounded from above depending only on $d,t$.

In this paper, we study a nonlocal extension of the Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model, where the pressure-like term is modeled as a convolution between vehicle density and a kernel function. This formulation captures nonlocal driver interactions and aligns structurally with the Euler-alignment system studied in [23]. Using a sticky particle approximation, we construct entropy solutions to the equation for the cumulative density and prove convergence of approximate solutions to weak solutions of the nonlocal system. The analysis includes well-posedness, stability estimates, and an entropic selection principle.

Subjects:

Given an arbitrary countable ordinal $\alpha $, we introduce the notion of type $I_{\alpha }$ C*-algebra and $\alpha $-subhomogeneous C*-algebra. When $\alpha =0$, these recover the notions of Fell C*-algebra and of commutative C*-algebra, respectively. When $\alpha = n <\omega $, these recover the notions of type $I_{n}$ C*-algebra and of $n$-subhomogeneous C*-algebra, respectively. We prove that a separable C*-algebra is liminary if and only if it is type $I_{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha <\omega _{1}$, and it is preliminary (i.e., has no infinite-dimensional irreducible representation) if and only if it is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous for some $\alpha <\omega _{1}$ . We also prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha $ there exists a separable preliminary C*-algebra that is type $I_{\alpha }$ and not type $I_{\beta }$ for $\beta <\alpha $, and a separable preliminary C*-algebra that is $\alpha $-subhomogeneous and not $\beta $-subhomogeneous for any $\beta <\alpha $.

Nevertheless, by introducing weak Lehmer codes, we construct explicitly multicomplexes and Lehmer complexes for any lower Bruhat interval in type $F_4$.

Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
We present a new solution to the formality problem for the framed Goldman--Turaev Lie bialgebra, constructing Goldman-Turaev homomorphic expansions (formality isomorphisms) from the Kontsevich integral. Our proof uses a three dimensional derivation of the Goldman-Turaev Lie biaglebra arising from a low-degree Vassiliev quotient -- the {\em emergent} quotient -- of tangles in a thickened punctured disk, modulo a Conway skein relation. This is in contrast to Massuyeau's 2018 proof using braids. A feature of our approach is a general conceptual framework which is applied to prove the compatibility of the homomorphic expansion with both the Goldman bracket and the technically challenging Turaev cobracket.

Recognisability for generalised hierarchical patterns and pattern spaces of finite local complexity
James J. Walton
Comments:

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We explore an extended notion of a tiling of translational finite local complexity (FLC) being substitutional, or hierarchical, to Euclidean `patterns' and define, more generally, a similar notion for spaces of patterns. We prove recognisability results for these, relating injectivity of substitution to aperiodicity, with no minimality requirements. More precisely, for a suitable power of the substitution map, we determine the size of fibre over any pattern to be the index of its inflated (translational) periods in its whole group of periods. This answers an open question of Cortez and Solomyak, on whether non-periodic tilings necessarily have unique pre-images under substitution: they do, even for a wider notion of pattern and being substitutional; conversely, for an appropriate power of the substitution, discretely periodic points necessarily have multiple pre-images. Our results cover examples of FLC pattern spaces, such as of uniformly discrete but non-relatively dense point sets, that contain elements with non-discrete groups of periods.

Graphical Willmore Problems with Low-Regularity Boundary and Dirichlet Data
Boris Gulyak
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We establish existence and regularity results for boundary value problems arising from the first variation of the Willmore energy in the graphical setting. Our focus lies on two-dimensional surfaces with fixed clamped boundary conditions, embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and represented as graphs of height functions over domains with non-smooth boundaries. Our approach involves constructing solutions through linearization and a fixed-point argument, requiring small boundary data in suitable functional spaces. Building on the results of Koch and Lamm \cite{koch2012geometric}, we rewrite the Willmore equation for graphs in a divergence form that allows the application of weighted second-order Sobolev spaces. This reformulation significantly weakens the regularity assumptions on both the boundary and the Dirichlet data, reducing them to the $C^{1+\alpha}$-class, while the solution remains smooth in the interior. Moreover, we extend the existence theory to domains with merely Lipschitz boundaries within a purely weighted Sobolev framework. Our approach is also applicable to other higher-order geometric PDEs, including the graphical Helfrich and surface diffusion equations.

We investigate the analogues of certain classical estimates of Littlewood for the Riemann zeta-function in the context of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions over function fields. In some situations, we are actually able to establish finer results in the function field setup than what is currently known in the original number field setup, and this leads us to an educated guess on what could happen for the Riemann zeta-function in such situations. Fourier analysis techniques play an important role in our approach.

Very Generalized LYM Inequality

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The LYM inequality is a fundamental result concerning the sizes of subsets in a Sperner family. Subsequent studies on the LYM inequality have been generalized to families of $r$-decompositions, where all components are required to avoid chains of the same length. In this paper, we relax this constraint by allowing components of a family of $r$-decompositions to avoid chains of distinct lengths, and derive generalized LYM inequalities across all the relevant settings, including set-theoretic, $q$-analog, continuous analog, and arithmetic analog frameworks. Notably, the bound in our LYM inequalities does not depend on the maximal length of all forbidden chains. Moreover, we extend our approach beyond $r$-decompositions to $r$-multichains, and establish analogous LYM inequalities.

We consider the hydrodynamic limits of the quantum Boltzmann equation with Fermi-Dirac statistics for hard sphere and hard potentials in the whole space. By analyzing the spectrum of the linearized collision operator combined with the transport operator and its associated semigroup, the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier limits from the BFD equation is verified rigorously. Compared to the results in [Jiang-Xiong-Zhou,J. Differ. Equ.,2022], this paper works with a lower regularity for the initial data. In addition, the fixed-point arguments together with a time iteration ensure us to obtain the lifespan of kinetic solution coincides with those of limiting fluid solution.

Optimal Repair of $(k+2, k, 2)$ MDS Array Codes
Zihao Zhang, Guodong Li, Sihuang Hu
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage systems as they provide optimal fault tolerance for a given amount of storage overhead.
The seminal work of Dimakis~\emph{et al.} first established a lower bound on the repair bandwidth for a single failed node of MDS codes, known as the \emph{cut-set bound}. MDS codes that achieve this bound are called minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes. Numerous constructions and theoretical analyses of MSR codes reveal that they typically require exponentially large sub-packetization levels, leading to significant disk I/O overhead. To mitigate this issue, many studies explore the trade-offs between the sub-packetization level and repair bandwidth, achieving reduced sub-packetization at the cost of suboptimal repair bandwidth. Despite these advances, the fundamental question of determining the minimum repair bandwidth for a single failure of MDS codes with fixed sub-packetization remains open.
In this paper, we address this challenge for the case of two parity nodes ($n-k=2$) and sub-packetization $\ell=2$. We derive tight lower bounds on both the minimum repair bandwidth and the minimum I/O overhead. Furthermore, we present two explicit MDS array code constructions that achieve these bounds, respectively, offering practical code designs with provable repair efficiency.

Building on Gaussian Free Fields and Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos, rigorous definitions of correlation functions and partition functions have been established, culminating in the probabilistic derivation of the DOZZ formula and a mathematically complete formulation of the conformal bootstrap for LCFT on Riemann surfaces. This survey aims to provide a synthetic account of these advances, emphasizing both the main achievements and the open problems that continue to drive the field.

Smoothing Binary Optimization: A Primal-Dual Perspective

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Binary optimization is a powerful tool for modeling combinatorial problems, yet scalable and theoretically sound solution methods remain elusive. Conventional solvers often rely on heuristic strategies with weak guarantees or struggle with large-scale instances. In this work, we introduce a novel primal-dual framework that reformulates unconstrained binary optimization as a continuous minimax problem, satisfying a strong max-min property. This reformulation effectively smooths the discrete problem, enabling the application of efficient gradient-based methods. We propose a simultaneous gradient descent-ascent algorithm that is highly parallelizable on GPUs and provably converges to a near-optimal solution in linear time. Extensive experiments on large-scale problems--including Max-Cut, MaxSAT, and Maximum Independent Set with up to 50,000 variables--demonstrate that our method identifies high-quality solutions within seconds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

We develop a unified framework that reconciles a barrier based geometric model of periodic sphere packings with a provably convergent discrete time dynamics. First, we introduce a C2 interior barrier U_nu that is compatible with a strict feasibility safeguard and has a Lipschitz gradient on the iterates domain. Second, we correct and formalize the discrete update and give explicit step size and damping rules. Third, we prove barrier to KKT consistency and state an interior variant clarifying the role of the quadratic term. Fourth, we show that strict prestress stability implies periodic infinitesimal rigidity of the contact framework. Fifth, we establish a Lyapunov energy descent principle, an energy nonexpansive feasibility projection (including a joint x and lattice basis B variant), and local linear convergence for the Spectral Projected Interior Trajectory (Spit) method. We also provide practical Hessian vector formulas to estimate smoothness and curvature, minimal schematic illustrations, and a short reproducibility stub. The emphasis is on rigorous assumptions and proofs; empirical evaluation is deferred.

Machine Learning Powered Feasible Path Framework with Adaptive Sampling for Black-box Optimization

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Black-box optimization (BBO) involves functions that are unknown, inexact and/or expensive-to-evaluate. Existing BBO algorithms face several challenges, including high computational cost from extensive evaluations, difficulty in handling complex constraints, lacking theoretical convergence guarantees and/or instability due to large solution quality variation. In this work, a machine learning-powered feasible path optimization framework (MLFP) is proposed for general BBO problems including complex constraints. An adaptive sampling strategy is first proposed to explore optimal regions and pre-filter potentially infeasible points to reduce evaluations. Machine learning algorithms are leveraged to develop surrogates of black-boxes. The feasible path algorithm is employed to accelerate theoretical convergence by updating independent variables rather than all. Computational studies demonstrate MLFP can rapidly and robustly converge around the KKT point, even training surrogates with small datasets. MLFP is superior to the state-of-the-art BBO algorithms, as it stably obtains the same or better solutions with fewer evaluations for benchmark examples.

Fix a rational prime $r \geq 5$. In this article, we study the integer solutions of the generalized Fermat equation of signature $(2p,2q,r)$, namely $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$, where the primes $p,q \geq 5$ are varying. For each rational prime $r \geq 5$, we first establish a condition on the solutions of the $S$-unit equation over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ such that there exists a constant $V_{r}>0$ (depending on $r$) for which the equation $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$ with $p,q \geq V_r$ has no non-trivial primitive integer solutions. Then for each rational prime $r \geq 2$, we prove that every elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ is modular. As an application of this, we prove that the above constant $V_r$ is effectively computable. Finally, we provide a criterion for $r$ such that the equation $x^{2p}+y^{2q}=z^r$ with $p,q \geq V_r$ has no non-trivial primitive integer solutions when the narrow class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_r+ \zeta_r^{-1})$ is odd.

Task-Oriented Computation Offloading for Edge Inference: An Integrated Bayesian Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework

Comments:
This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...

For many such surfaces, we show that this cohomology class is nontrivial, and that the behavior of its powers depends on the genus and the type of ends. As an application, we extend Morita's non-lifting theorem to many infinite-type surfaces, including surfaces of infinite genus.

Power residues, digit expansions and relative class numbers
Kurt Girstmair
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
This is a survey of a connection between the distribution of certain power residues modulo $p$, $p$ a prime, and relative class numbers. The focus lies on quadratic residues and sixth power residues. Dirichlet's class number formula yields a number of results about the distribution of quadratic residues, for instance, the well-known fact that the interval $[0,p/2]$ contains more quadratic residues than nonresidues. This class number formula is also responsible for some properties of the digit expansions of numbers $m/p$, $p\NDIV m$. In a certain sense the results based on Dirichlet's formula can be extended to sixth power residues, where geometry plays an important role.

We obtain an exact expression for the structured condition number of simple eigenvalues of symmetric, skew-symmetric and even/odd rational matrix functions, and tight bounds are obtained for simple eigenvalues of Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, even/odd, and palindromic rational matrix functions.

UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems with Fluid Antennas

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions, and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC systems.

Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes

Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.

Multicast for securely sharing confidential data among many users is becoming increasingly important. Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD), physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows. Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.

Rigid automorphisms of linking systems of finite groups of Lie type
Jonathon Villareal
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a centric linking system associated to a saturated fusion system on a finite $p$-group $S$. An automorphism of $\mathcal{L}$ is said to be rigid if it restricts to the identity on the fusion system. An inner rigid automorphism is conjugation by some element of the center of $S$. If $\mathcal{L}$ is the centric linking system of a finite group $G$, then rigid automorphisms of $\mathcal{L}$ are closely related to automorphisms of $G$ that centralize $S$. For odd primes, all rigid automorphisms are known to be inner, but this fails for the prime 2. We determine which known quasisimple linking systems at the prime 2 have a noninner rigid automorphism. Based on previous results, this reduces to handling the case of the linking systems at the prime 2 of finite simple groups of Lie type in odd characteristic. These have no noninner rigid automorphisms with two families of exceptions: the 2-dimensional projective special linear groups and even-dimensional orthogonal groups for quadratic forms of nonsquare discriminant.

Geometric Topology (math.GT)
In 2009, Kawauchi proved that every strongly negative amphichiral knot is rationally slice. However, as shown by Hartley in 1980, there are examples of negative amphichiral knots that are not strongly negative amphichiral. In this paper, we prove that every negative amphichiral link whose amphichiral map preserves each component is rationally slice. Our proof relies on a systematic analysis of the action induced by the negative amphichiral map on the JSJ decomposition of the link exterior. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions on such an action to deduce when a negative amphichiral knot is either isotopic to, or concordant to, a strongly negative amphichiral knot. In particular, we prove that every fibered negative amphichiral knot is strongly negative amphichiral, answering a question asked by Kim and Wu in 2016 on Miyazaki knots.

Subjects:

A $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson manifold is a manifold $M$ together with a bivector field $\Lambda$, a 3-form $\varphi$, and a closed 1-form $\theta$ such that the exterior derivative $d\varphi$ of $\varphi$ is the wedge product of $\theta$ and $\varphi$, the anchor $\Lambda^\#(\theta)$ of $\theta$ is identically zero, and the Jacobiator (Jacobi operator; which is half the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of $\Lambda$ with itself) associated to $\Lambda$ is the anchor $\Lambda^\#(\varphi)$ of $\varphi$. In this work, we define the notion of a contravariant derivative adapted to these manifolds and establish the prequantization condition in terms of the $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson cohomology. We then introduce a polarization and construct a quantum Hilbert space. These results are illustrated by examples.

Absolute continuity of finite-dimensional distributions of Hermite processes via Malliavin calculus
Laurent Loosveldt, Yassine Nachit, Ivan Nourdin, Ciprian Tudor
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We investigate the existence of densities for finite-dimensional distributions of Hermite processes of order \(q \ge 1\) and self-similarity parameter \(H\in(\frac12,1)\). Whereas the Gaussian case \(q=1\) (fractional Brownian motion) is well understood, the non-Gaussian situation has not yet been settled. In this work, we extend the classical three-step approach used in the Gaussian case: factorization of the determinant into conditional terms, strong local nondeterminism, and non-degeneracy. We transport this strategy to the Hermite setting using Malliavin calculus. Specifically, we establish a determinant identity for the Malliavin matrix, prove strong local nondeterminism at the level of Malliavin derivatives, and apply the Bouleau-Hirsch criterion. Consequently, for any distinct times \(t_1,\dots,t_n\), the vector \((Z^{H,q}_{t_1},\dots,Z^{H,q}_{t_n})\) of a Hermite process admits a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Beyond the result itself, the main contribution is the methodology, which could extend to other non-Gaussian models.

Toric surface codes and the periodicity of polytopes
Amelia Gibbs, Eliza Hogan, Kelly Jabbusch, Jenna Plute, Nicholas Toloczko
Subjects:

Toric codes are error-correcting codes that are derived from toric varieties, which hold a unique correspondence to integral convex polytopes. In this paper, we focus on integral convex polytopes $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ and the toric codes they define. We begin by studying period-1 polytopes -- polytopes satisfying the property $L(tP)$ = $tL(P)$ for all $t \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, where $tP$ is the $t$-dilate of $P$, and we prove an explicit formula for the minimum distance of toric codes associated to a particular class of period-1 polytopes. We also apply the methods of Little and Schwarz, using Vandermonde matrices, to compute the minimum distance of another class of period-1 polytopes.

We study integral models of some Shimura varieties with bad reduction at a prime p, namely the Siegel modular variety and Shimura varieties associated with some unitary groups. We focus on the case where the level structure at p is given by the pro-unipotent radical of an Iwahori subgroup, and we analyze the geometry of the integral models that have been proposed until now: we show that they are almost never normal and in some cases not flat over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We do so by showing the failure of these geometric properties on the corresponding local models, and we explain how the local model diagrams can be interpreted using the root stack construction.

A Converse For the Capacity of the Shotgun Sequencing Channel with Erasures

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
The shotgun sequencing process involves fragmenting a long DNA sequence (input string) into numerous shorter, unordered, and overlapping segments (referred to as \emph{reads}). The reads are sequenced, and later aligned to reconstruct the original string. Viewing the sequencing process as the read-phase of a DNA storage system, the information-theoretic capacity of noise-free shotgun sequencing has been characterized in literature. Motivated by the base-wise quality scores available in practical sequencers, a recent work considered the \emph{shotgun sequencing channel with erasures}, in which the symbols in the reads are assumed to contain random erasures. Achievable rates for this channel were identified. In the present work, we obtain a converse for this channel. The arguments for the proof involve a careful analysis of a genie-aided decoder, which knows the correct locations of the reads. The converse is not tight in general. However, it meets the achievability result asymptotically in some channel parameters.

Inner approximations of doubling weights with applications to Beurling-Malliavin theory in Toeplitz kernels
Alex Bergman
Subjects:

Let $f$ be a strictly increasing smooth function, such that $f'$ is comparable to a weight $\alpha'$ which is locally doubling and satisfies a non-triviality condition to be explained in the paper. We construct a meromorphic inner function $J$, such that $f-\arg(J)$ is bounded and $\arg(J)'$ is comparable to $\alpha'$ up to polynomial loss. We give two applications of this result. The first is a sufficient density condition for a set $\Lambda$ to be a zero set for a Toeplitz kernel with real analytic and unimodular symbol. Our second application is to describe a class of admissible Beurling-Malliavin majorants in model spaces. The generality considered here lets us treat most cases of model spaces generated by one-component inner functions.

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Rings and Algebras (math.RA); Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den Bergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of double Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson brackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer developed and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption that there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first main result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed double Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the approach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double Poisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is acyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory can be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson and gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A second focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex algebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC versions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under each representation functor. Our second main result is the development of cohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues of the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More importantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology theories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application, we compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC de Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we describe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors.

Constructions of Compact Dupin Hypersurfaces with Non-constant Lie Curvatures
Thomas E. Cecil
Comments:
27 pages
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
A hypersurface $M$ in the unit sphere $S^n \subset {\bf R}^{n+1}$ is Dupin if along each curvature surface of $M$, the corresponding principal curvature is constant. If the number $g$ of distinct principal curvatures is constant on $M$, then $M$ is called proper Dupin. In this expository paper, we give a detailed description of two important types of constructions of compact proper Dupin hypersurfaces in $S^n$. One construction was published in 1989 by Pinkall and Thorbergsson, and the second was published in 1989 by Miyaoka and Ozawa. Both types of examples have the property that they do not have constant Lie curvatures, which are the cross-ratios of the principal curvatures, taken four at a time. Thus, these examples are not equivalent by a Lie sphere transformation to an isoparametric (constant principal curvatures) hypersurface in $S^n$. So they are counterexamples to a conjecture of Cecil and Ryan in 1985 that every compact proper Dupin hypersurface in $S^n$ is equivalent to an isoparametric hypersurface by a Lie sphere transformation.

Capacity in high dimensional percolation
Amine Asselah, Bruno Schapira, Perla Sousi
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We introduce a notion of capacity for high dimensional critical percolation by showing that for any finite set $A$, the suitably rescaled probability that the cluster of $z$ intersects $A$ converges as $\|z\|\to\infty$. This can be viewed as a generalisation of the asymptotic of the two point function and we call the limit the p-capacity of $A$. We next show that the probability that the Incipient Infinite Cluster of $z$ intersects the set $A$ appropriately normalised is also of order the p-capacity of $A$ as $\|z\|\to\infty$. We conjecture that the p-capacity is of the same order as the $(d-4)$-Bessel-Riesz capacity and in support of this we estimate the p-capacity of balls. As a byproduct of our techniques we give a simpler proof of the one-arm exponent of Kozma and Nachmias for dimensions 8 and higher and as long as the two point function asymptotic holds. Our proofs make use of a new large deviations bound on the pioneers, that is the number of points on the boundary of a box which are part of the cluster of the origin restricted to this box.

Given a finite simple connected graph $\Gamma$, the graphical configuration space $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ is the space of collections of points in $X$ indexed by the vertices of $\Gamma$, where points corresponding to adjacent vertices must be distinct. When $X=\mathbb{R}^d$ and the points are replaced by small disks, the resulting spaces for all possible graphs fit together into an algebraic structure that extends the little disks operad, called the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. In this paper, we investigate the homotopical and algebraic properties of the little disks contractad $\mathcal{D}_d$. We construct and study Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of graphical configuration spaces, which provide a convenient model for $\mathcal{D}_d$ within the class of compact manifolds with boundary. Using these and wonderful compactifications, we prove that $\mathcal{D}_d$ is formal in the category of (Hopf) contractads for $d=1$, $d=2$, and for chordal graphs for any $d$. We also identify the first obstructions to coformality in the case of cyclic graphs. In addition, we give a combinatorial description of the cell structure of $\mathcal{D}_2$ and present applications to the study of graphical configuration spaces $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X)$ using the language of twisted algebras.

Operator Algebras (math.OA); Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
Semi-free ideal rings, or semifirs, were introduced by Paul M. Cohn to study universal localizations in the non-commutative setting. We provide new examples of semifirs consisting of analytic functions in several non-commuting variables. These examples arise canonically in free analysis by completing the free algebra in the topology of ``uniform convergence on operator-space balls'' in the non-commutative universe of tuples of square matrices of any finite size.
We show, in particular, that the ring of (uniformly) entire non-commutative (NC) functions in $d \in \mathbb{N}$ non-commuting variables, $\scr{O}_d$, is a semifir. Every finitely--generated right (or left) ideal in $\scr{O}_d$ is closed, which yields an analytic extension of G. Bergman's nullstellensatz for the free algebra. Any semifir admits a universal skew field of fractions; applying this to $\scr{O}_d$ yields the universal skew field of ``NC meromorphic expressions", $\scr{M} _d$. We show that any $f \in \scr{M} _d$ has a well-defined domain and evaluations in a large class of stably-finite topological algebras, including finite $C^*$-algebras, extending a result of Cohn for NC rational functions. As an application, we extend the almost sure convergence result of Haagerup and Thorbjörnsen for free polynomials evaluated on tuples of random matrices to the setting of NC meromorphic expressions.

Asymptotic instability for the forced Navier--Stokes equations in critical Besov spaces
Mikihiro Fujii, Hiroyuki Tsurumi
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The asymptotic stability is one of the classical problems in the field of mathematical analysis of fluid mechanics. In $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 3$, it is easily proved by the standard argument that if the given small external force decays at temporal infinity, then the small forced Navier--Stokes flow also strongly converges to zero as time tends to infinity in the framework of the critical Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $1 \leq p < n$ and $1 \leq q < \infty$. In the present paper, we show that this asymptotic stability fails for $p \geq n$ with $n \geq 3$ in the sense that there exist arbitrary small external forces whose critical Besov norm decays in large time, whereas the corresponding Navier--Stokes flows oscillate and do not strongly converge as $t \to \infty$ in the framework of the critical Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Moreover, we find that the situation is different in the two-dimensional case $n=2$ and show the forced Navier--Stokes flow is asymptotically unstable in $\dot{B}_{p,1}^{2/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ for all $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Our instability does not appear in the linear level but is caused by the nonlinear interaction from external forces.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose a reduced-order modeling approach for nonlinear, parameter-dependent ordinary differential equations (ODE). Dimensionality reduction is achieved using nonlinear maps represented by autoencoders. The resulting low-dimensional ODE is then solved using standard integration in time schemes, and the high-dimensional solution is reconstructed from the low-dimensional one. We investigate the applicability of neural networks for constructing effective autoencoders with the property of reconstructing the input manifold with null representation error. We study the convergence of the reduced-order model to the high-fidelity one. Numerical experiments show the robustness and accuracy of our approach, highlighting its potential to accelerate complex dynamical simulations without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, we examine how the reduction influences the stability properties of the reconstructed high-dimensional solution.

A case can be made that the utility of quasi-linear systems of conservation laws as physical models is largely limited to Euler system models of fluid flow, at least in higher dimensions. Qualified corroboration of this conjecture is obtained here, by attempt to extend the class of systems attractive as physical models via the associated symmetry group.

Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.

Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We define a Chern--Simons invariant of connections on stably trivial vector bundles over smooth manifolds, taking values in $3$-forms modulo closed forms with integral cohomology class. We show an additivity property of this invariant for connections defined on a direct sum of bundles, under a certain block-diagonality condition on the curvature. As a corollary, we deduce an obstruction for conformally immersing a $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold in a translation manifold of dimension $n+1$.

Strong cohomological integrality for symmetric stacks

Subjects:

We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ibáñez Nuñez--Pădurariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces.
Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ibáñez Nuñez--Pădurariu.

Fundamental Limits of Noncoherent Massive Random Access Networks

Comments:
25 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks, modeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells. To characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument is invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their codebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a generalization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in the literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the transmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading coefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed that the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model, rigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds depends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering cells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the interferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay exponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit power. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited networks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews ("Fundamental limits of cooperation", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by random user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In contrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially, then the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded capacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since the condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents interference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple access. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating interference as noise.

Two ADI compact difference methods for variable-exponent diffusion wave equations
Hao Zhang, Kexin Li, Wenlin Qiu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we study two-dimensional diffusion-wave equations with variable exponent, modeling mechanical diffusive wave propagation in viscoelastic media with spatially varying properties. We first transform the diffusion-wave model into an equivalent form via the convolution method. Two time discretization strategies are then applied to approximate each term in the transformed equation, yielding two fully discrete schemes based on a spatial compact finite difference method. To reduce computational cost, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique is employed. We prove that both ADI compact schemes are unconditionally stable and convergent. Under solution regularity, the first scheme achieves $\alpha(0)$-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space, while the second scheme attains second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of VCN${}_{k,k}$-dimension (essentially $k$-dependence from Shelah's classification theory). This model suggests a theoretical explanation for the success of certain algorithms in the 2006~Netflix Prize competition.

Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.

A Recovery Theory for Diffusion Priors: Deterministic Analysis of the Implicit Prior Algorithm
Oscar Leong, Yann Traonmilin
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors, but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set, we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions: uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Quantum error correction beyond $SU(2)$ spin, bosonic, and permutation-invariant codes from convex geometry

Comments:

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.

Motivated by the limited interaction between the mathematical physics community and theoretical physicists - particularly in high-energy theory - we present a computation that is typically the first example in QFT courses but, to our knowledge, does not appear in the literature: the scattering amplitudes of the $\lambda \phi^4$ model in four-dimensional space-time, derived within the framework of causal perturbation theory. Our aim is to introduce this mathematically rigorous formalism in the most accessible way possible. To that end, we emphasize general aspects of the theory while deliberately avoiding overly sophisticated mathematics. Finally, we briefly discuss how the divergent integrals encountered in quantum field theory can be reinterpreted as issues concerning the domain of distributions.

Data-Driven State Observers for Measure-Preserving Systems

The increasing use of data-driven control strategies gives rise to the problem of learning-based state observation. Motivated by this need, the present work proposes a data-driven approach for the synthesis of state observers for discrete-time nonlinear systems with measure-preserving dynamics. To this end, Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenburger (KKL) observers are shown to be well-defined, where the observer design boils down to determining a nonlinear injective mapping of states and its pseudo-inverse. For its learning-based construction, the KKL observer is related to the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, defined on a Sobolev-type reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) on which they are shown to be normal operators and thus have a spectral resolution. Hence, observer synthesis algorithms, based on kernel interpolation/regression routines for the desired injective mapping in the observer and its pseudo-inverse, have been proposed in various settings of available dataset -- (i) many orbits, (ii) single long orbit, and (iii) snapshots. Theoretical error analyses are provided, and numerical studies on a chaotic Lorenz system are demonstrated.

Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs
Daniil Shmelev, Cristopher Salvi
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs. These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Optimal phase change for a generalized Grover's algorithm

We study the generalized Grover's algorithm with an arbitrary amplitude vector to find the optimal phase change for maximizing the gain in probability for the target of each iteration. In the classic setting of Grover's algorithm with a real initial amplitude vector, we find that a phase change of $\pi$ stays optimal until the probability of observing the target is quite close to 1. We provide a formula for identifying this cut-off point based on the size of the data set. When the amplitude is truly complex, we find that the optimal phase change depends non-trivially on the complexity of the amplitude vector. We provide an optimization formula to identify the required optimal phase change.

Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped dimensions, generalizing the results of \cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of convergence in statistical and online learning.

The KP equation is perhaps the most famous example of a three-dimensional integrable system. Here we show that a non-commutative five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory living on the projective spinor bundle of three-dimensional space-time compactifies to a Lagrangian formulation of the KP equation. Essential to the definition of the theory is a 2-form pulled back from minitwistor space. The dispersionless limit of the KP equation is similarly described by Poisson-Chern-Simons theory. We further show that, consistent with integrability, all tree level amplitudes vanish. The universal vertex algebra living on a two-dimensional surface defect in $5d$ is $W_{1+\infty}$, and its operator products coincide with collinear splitting functions on space-time. Taking the dispersionless limit contracts the vertex algebra to $w_{1+\infty}$.

Scaling Laws are Redundancy Laws

Subjects:

Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.

Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Gaussian splatting holography

In-line holography offers high space-bandwidth product imaging with a simplified lens-free optical system. However, in-line holographic reconstruction is troubled by twin images arising from the Hermitian symmetry of complex fields. Twin images disrupt the reconstruction in solving the ill-posed phase retrieval problem. The known parameters are less than the unknown parameters, causing phase ambiguities. State-of-the-art deep-learning or non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with twin-image disturbance. We propose the Gaussian splatting holography (GSH) for twin-image-suppressed holographic reconstruction. GSH uses Gaussian splatting for optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown parameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase retrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities. Additionally, the Gaussian splatting tends to form sharp patterns rather than those with noisy twin-image backgrounds as each Gaussian has a spatially slow-varying profile. Experiments show that GSH achieves constraint-free recovery for in-line holography with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio equal to 26 dB, and structure similarity equal to 0.8. Combined with total variation, GSH can be further improved, obtaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31 dB, and a high compression ability of up to 15 folds.

Designing nanophotonic devices with minimal human intervention has gained substantial attention due to the complexity and precision required in modern optical technologies. While inverse design techniques typically rely on conventional electromagnetic solvers as forward models within optimization routines, the substantial electrical size and subwavelength characteristics of nanophotonic structures necessitate significantly accelerated simulation methods. In this work, we introduce a forward modeling approach based on the volume integral equation (VIE) formulation as an efficient alternative to traditional finite-difference (FD)-based methods. We derive the adjoint method tailored specifically for the VIE framework to efficiently compute optimization gradients and present a novel unidirectional mode excitation strategy compatible with VIE solvers. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that our VIE-based approach provides multiple orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over conventional FD methods in both time and frequency domains. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we successfully designed two representative nanophotonic components: a selective mode reflector and a 3 dB power splitter. Our results underscore the significant runtime advantages offered by the VIE-based framework, highlighting its promising role in accelerating inverse design workflows for next-generation nanophotonic devices.

We present the components of a high-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver designed to simulate high-Reynolds-number stratified flows. The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.

We introduce a bi-graded polynomial that encodes the cohomology groups of the wild Hitchin system of type~$A_{n-1}$, constructed using an irregular singularity (determined by an integer~$m$) and an arbitrary regular singularity~$f$. When the regular singularity is of the form~$f = [1, \ldots, 1]$, the bi-graded polynomial~$C_{m,n}(q,t)$ coincides with the bigraded rational parking function defined combinatorially, admitting a Schur expansion~$C_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) s_\lambda(x)$. For general~$f$, the polynomial takes the form~$C^f_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) K_{\lambda f}$, where~$K_{\lambda f}$ denotes the Kostka number. We conjecture that this bi-graded polynomial agrees with the one arising from the perverse filtration of the Hitchin fibration, or equivalently, from the weight filtration of the mixed Hodge structure from the character variety. We also give a description by using the geometry of affine Springer fiber.}

A Generalized $χ_n$-Function

The mapping $\chi_n$ from $\F_{2}^{n}$ to itself defined by $y=\chi_n(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+2}(1+x_{i+1})$, where the indices are computed modulo $n$, has been widely studied for its applications in lightweight cryptography. However, $\chi_n $ is bijective on $\F_2^n$ only when $n$ is odd, restricting its use to odd-dimensional vector spaces over $\F_2$. To address this limitation, we introduce and analyze the generalized mapping $\chi_{n, m}$ defined by $y=\chi_{n,m}(x)$ with $y_i=x_i+x_{i+m} (x_{i+m-1}+1)(x_{i+m-2}+1) \cdots (x_{i+1}+1)$, where $m$ is a fixed integer with $m\nmid n$. To investigate such mappings, we further generalize $\chi_{n,m}$ to $\theta_{m, k}$, where $\theta_{m, k}$ is given by $y_i=x_{i+mk} \prod_{\substack{j=1,\,\, m \nmid j}}^{mk-1} \left(x_{i+j}+1\right), \,\,{\rm for }\,\, i\in \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. We prove that these mappings generate an abelian group isomorphic to the group of units in $\F_2[z]/(z^{\lfloor n/m\rfloor +1})$. This structural insight enables us to construct a broad class of permutations over $\F_2^n$ for any positive integer $n$, along with their inverses. We rigorously analyze algebraic properties of these mappings, including their iterations, fixed points, and cycle structures. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive database of the cryptographic properties for iterates of $\chi_{n,m}$ for small values of $n$ and $m$. Finally, we conduct a comparative security and implementation cost analysis among $\chi_{n,m}$, $\chi_n$, $\chi\chi_n$ (EUROCRYPT 2025 \cite{belkheyar2025chi}) and their variants, and prove Conjecture~1 proposed in~\cite{belkheyar2025chi} as a by-product of our study. Our results lead to generalizations of $\chi_n$, providing alternatives to $\chi_n$ and $\chi\chi_n$.

Pipeline transport of dense-phase CO2-rich mixtures is a crucial component in carbon capture and storage (CCS). Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.

Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices

Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.

Unbiased Parameter Estimation of Partially Observed Diffusions using Diffusion Bridges
Miguel Alvarez, Ajay Jasra
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this article we consider the estimation of static parameters for partially observed diffusion processes with discrete-time observations over a fixed time interval. In particular, when one only has access to time-discretized solutions of the diffusions we build upon the works of \cite{ub_par,ub_grad} to devise a method that can estimate the parameters without time-discretization bias. We leverage an identity associated to the gradient of the log-likelihood associated to diffusion bridges, which has not been used before. Contrary to the afore mentioned methods, the diffusion coefficient can depend on the parameters and our approach facilitates the use of more efficient Markov chain sampling algorithms. We prove that our estimator is unbiased with finite variance and demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology in several examples.

The ongoing convergence of spectrum and hardware requirements for wireless sensing and communication applications has fueled the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm in next-generation networks. Neural-network-based ISAC leverages data-driven learning techniques to add sensing capabilities to existing communication infrastructure. This paper presents a novel signal-processing framework for such neural ISAC systems based on the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink. Our approach enables generalized sensing functionality without modifying the MIMO-OFDM communication link. Specifically, our neural ISAC pipeline measures the backscattered communication signals to generate discrete map representations of spatial occupancy, formulated as multiclass or multilabel classification problems, which can then be utilized by specialized downstream tasks. To improve sensing performance in closed or cluttered environments, our neural ISAC pipeline relies on features specifically designed to mitigate strong reflective paths. Extensive simulations using ray-tracing models demonstrate that our neural ISAC framework reliably reconstructs scene maps without altering the MIMO-OFDM communication pipeline or reducing data rates.

Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Econometrics (econ.EM); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias
Shuofeng Zhang, Ard Louis
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Small-$b$ expansion of the DOZZ formula for light operators

We present a systematic small-$b$ expansion of the Liouville DOZZ three-point structure constant in the light-operator regime $\alpha_i = b\sigma_i$ as $b\to 0$. In this limit, the exact DOZZ function factorizes into a prefactor $\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ and a power series in $b^2$, \[ C(b\sigma_1,b\sigma_2,b\sigma_3) =\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_i)\Bigl[1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty b^{2n}\,\Omega_n(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\Bigr]. \] Using Thorn's asymptotic expansion of the $\Upsilon_b$-function, we derive closed-form expressions for the leading coefficients $\Omega_n(\sigma_i)$ and show that each $\Omega_n$ is a symmetric polynomial in the variables $\sigma_i$. Our expansion provides explicit perturbative corrections to the semiclassical Liouville three-point function and therefore supplies a practical tool for applications in celestial holography, in particular, for generating loop-level corrections to the tree-level three-gluon scattering amplitude using the inverse Mellin transform. We conclude by outlining these directions for further development. In particular, we highlight that a primary next step is to extend this framework to four-point amplitudes.

In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.

Towards mixed phase correlators in monomial matrix models

Subjects:

Correlators in monomial Hermitian matrix model strongly depend on the choice of eigenvalue integration contours. We express Schur correlator in case of several different integration contours (mixed phase case) as a sum over products of Schur correlators for just one type of contour (pure phase), where expansion coefficients are manifestly made from Littlewood-Richardson and Mugnaghan-Nakayama coefficients.
Further, for pure phase Schur correlators we find concise superintegrability formulas that unify both usual and exotic cases, that before looked very different from one another.

Several toolkits have been proposed for this task, yet there is still no industry standard. We present this http URL (this https URL), an easily-extendable PyTorch-based Python package for training DNNs with stochastic constraints. We implement multiple previously unimplemented algorithms for stochastically constrained stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the toolkit use by comparing two algorithms on a deep learning task with fairness constraints.

Exponent Function for Stationary Memoryless Channels with Input Cost at Rates above the Capacity

Subjects:

We consider the stationaly memoryless channels with input cost. We prove that for transmission rates above the capacity the correct probability of decoding tends to zero exponentially as the block length $n$ of codes tends to infinity. In the case where both of channel input and output sets are finite, we determine the optimal exponent function on the above exponential decay of the correct probability. To derive this result we use a new technique called the recuresive method, which is based on the information spectrum approach. The recursive method utilize a certain recursive structure on the information spectrum quantities.

Let \(X\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}\) be a smooth cubic hypersurface, and let \(F(X)\) be the variety of lines on \(X\). We prove the surjectivity of the cylinder maps on the Chow groups of \(F(X)\) and \(X\) if \(X\) contains a one-cycle of degree \(1\). Mongardi and Ottem previously proved the integral Hodge conjecture for curve classes on hyperkähler manifolds. Using the cylinder maps, we provide an alternative proof for the \(F(X)\) of a smooth complex cubic fourfold \(X\), which is a special hyperkähler fourfold. In addition, we confirm the integral Tate conjecture for \(F(X)\) of a smooth cubic fourfold \(X\) over a finitely generated field.

A Linear-Quadratic Stackelberg Differential Game with Mixed Deterministic and Stochastic Controls
Jingtao Shi, Guangchen Wang
Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper is concerned with a linear-quadratic (LQ) leader-follower differential game with mixed deterministic and stochastic controls. In the game, the follower is a random controller which means that the follower can choose adapted stochastic processes, while the leader is a deterministic controller which means that the leader can choose only deterministic time functions. Such problem is motivated by a pension fund insurance problem, with government, supervisory or employer being a deterministic leader and individual producer or retail investor being a random follower. An open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium solution is considered. First, an optimal control process of the follower is characterized by a stationary condition of forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE) and a convexity condition of SDE. Then it is represented as a linear functional of optimal state variable of the follower and the leader's control variable, via a classical Riccati equation. Then an optimal control function of the leader is first characterized by a convexity condition of FBSDE and a stationary condition of mean-field type FBSDE. And it is represented as a functional of expectation of optimal state variable of the leader, with the help of a system consisting of two cross-coupled Riccati equations and a two-point boundary value problem of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The solvabilities of this new system of Riccati equations and two-point boundary value problem and investigated.

Trivalent vertices and bordered knot Floer homology in the standard basis
Andrew Manion
Comments:
118 pages; 49 figures. This version accepted for publication in Geometry & Topology
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We define new algebras, local bimodules, and bimodule maps in the spirit of Ozsvath-Szabo's bordered knot Floer homology. We equip them with the structure of 2-representations of the categorified negative half U^- of U_q(gl(1|1)), 1-morphisms of such, and 2-morphisms respectively, and show that they categorify representations of U_q(gl(1|1)^-) and maps between them. Unlike with Ozsvath-Szabo's algebras, the algebras considered here can be built from a higher tensor product operation recently introduced by Rouquier and the author.
Our bimodules are all motivated by holomorphic disk counts in Heegaard diagrams; for positive and negative crossings, the bimodules can also be expressed as mapping cones involving a singular-crossing bimodule and the identity bimodule. In fact, they arise from an action of the monoidal category of Soergel bimodules via Rouquier complexes in the usual way, the first time (to the author's knowledge) such an expression has been obtained for braiding bimodules in Heegaard Floer homology.
Furthermore, the singular crossing bimodule naturally factors into two bimodules for trivalent vertices; such bimodules have not appeared in previous bordered-Floer approaches to knot Floer homology. The action of the Soergel category comes from an action of categorified quantum gl(2) on the 2-representation 2-category of U^- in line with the ideas of skew Howe duality, where the trivalent vertex bimodules are associated to 1-morphisms E, F in categorified quantum gl(2).

On Single Server Private Information Retrieval with Private Coded Side Information

IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 69, no. 5, pp. 3263-3284, 2025
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Motivated by an open problem and a conjecture, this work studies the problem of single server private information retrieval with private coded side information (PIR-PCSI) that was recently introduced by Heidarzadeh et al. The goal of PIR-PCSI is to allow a user to efficiently retrieve a desired message $\bm{W}_{\bm{\theta}}$, which is one of $K$ independent messages that are stored at a server, while utilizing private side information of a linear combination of a uniformly chosen size-$M$ subset ($\bm{\mathcal{S}}\subset[K]$) of messages. The settings PIR-PCSI-I and PIR-PCSI-II correspond to the constraints that $\bm{\theta}$ is generated uniformly from $[K]\setminus\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, and $\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, respectively. In each case, $(\bm{\theta},\bm{\mathcal{S}})$ must be kept private from the server. The capacity is defined as the supremum over message and field sizes, of achievable rates (number of bits of desired message retrieved per bit of download) and is characterized by Heidarzadeh et al. for PIR-PCSI-I in general, and for PIR-PCSI-II for $M>(K+1)/2$ as $(K-M+1)^{-1}$. For $2\leq M\leq (K+1)/2$ the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II remains open, and it is conjectured that even in this case the capacity is $(K-M+1)^{-1}$. We show the capacity of PIR-PCSI-II is equal to $2/K$ for $2 \leq M \leq \frac{K+1}{2}$, which is strictly larger than the conjectured value, and does not depend on $M$ within this parameter regime. Remarkably, half the side-information is found to be redundant. We also characterize the infimum capacity (infimum over fields instead of supremum), and the capacity with private coefficients. The results are generalized to PIR-PCSI-I ($\theta\in[K]\setminus\mathcal{S}$) and PIR-PCSI ($\theta\in[K]$) settings.

Reduced cohomology motivates to look at harmonic functions which satisfy certain gradient conditions. If $G$ is a direct product of two infinite groups or a (FC-central)-by-cyclic group, then there are no harmonic functions with gradient in $c_0$ on its Cayley graphs. From this, it follows that a metabelian group $G$ has no harmonic functions with gradient in $\ell^p$.

Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants of a quiver with potential can be expressed in terms of simpler attractor DT invariants by a universal formula. The coefficients in this formula are calculated combinatorially using attractor flow trees. In this paper, we prove that these coefficients are genus 0 log Gromov--Witten invariants of $d$-dimensional toric varieties, where $d$ is the number of vertices of the quiver. This result follows from a log-tropical correspondence theorem which relates $(d-2)$-dimensional families of tropical curves obtained as universal deformations of attractor flow trees, and rational log curves in toric varieties.

Let $U^N$ be a family of $N\times N$ independent Haar unitary random matrices and their adjoints, $Z^N$ a family of deterministic matrices, and $P$ a self-adjoint noncommutative polynomial, i.e. for any $N$, $P(U^N,Z^N)$ is self-adjoint, $f$ a smooth function. We prove that for any $k$, if $f$ is smooth enough, there exist deterministic constants $\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)$ such that $$ \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1}{N}\text{Tr}\left( f(P(U^N,Z^N)) \right)\right]\ =\ \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)}{N^{2i}}\ +\ \mathcal{O}(N^{-2k-2}) .$$ Besides, the constants $\alpha_i^P(f,Z^N)$ are built explicitly with the help of free probability. As a corollary, we prove that given $\alpha<1/2$, for $N$ large enough, every eigenvalue of $P(U^N,Z^N)$ is $N^{-\alpha}$-close to the spectrum of $P(u,Z^N)$ where $u$ is a $d$-tuple of free Haar unitaries. We also prove the convergence of the norm of any polynomial $P(U^N\otimes I_M, I_N\otimes Y^M)$ as long as the family $Y^M$ converges strongly and that $M\ll N \ln^{-3}(N)$.

We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, or computation axioms, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.

We pay special attention to the dependence of our bounds on the mixing time of the corresponding chain. Precisely, we establish explicit bounds that are linked to the constants from the martingale version of the Rosenthal inequality, as well as the constants that characterize the mixing properties of the underlying Markov kernel. Finally, our proof technique is, up to our knowledge, new and is based on a recurrent application of the Poisson decomposition.

Cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes are used in various private information retrieval (PIR) schemes (e.g., with secure storage) and in secure distributed batch matrix multiplication (SDBMM). Using a recently developed $N$-sum box abstraction of a quantum multiple-access channel (QMAC), we translate CSA schemes over classical multiple-access channels into efficient quantum CSA schemes over a QMAC, achieving maximal superdense coding gain. Because of the $N$-sum box abstraction, the underlying problem of coding to exploit quantum entanglements for CSA schemes, becomes conceptually equivalent to that of designing a channel matrix for a MIMO MAC subject to given structural constraints imposed by the $N$-sum box abstraction, such that the resulting MIMO MAC is able to implement the functionality of a CSA scheme (encoding/decoding) \emph{over-the-air}. Applications include Quantum PIR with secure and MDS-coded storage, as well as Quantum SDBMM.

Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.

We show that this construction is compatible with the representation functor which associates to any double Poisson (vertex) algebra and any positive integer a Poisson (vertex) algebra. We also consider related constructions, such as Poisson reductions and Hamiltonian reductions, with the aim of comparing the different corresponding categories. This allows us to provide various interesting examples of double Poisson vertex algebras, in particular from double quivers.

This paper explores several examples of $\infty$-equipments, including the prototypical example of the $\infty$-equipment of $\infty$-categories and the more general $\infty$-equipments of internal $\infty$-categories. The ultimate objective of this article is to study the basic concepts of category theory within an arbitrary $\infty$-equipment, such as colimits and Kan extensions.

The Stochastic Steepest Descent Method for Robust Optimization in Banach Spaces
Neil K. Chada, Philip J. Herbert
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Stochastic gradient methods have been a popular and powerful choice of optimization methods, aimed at minimizing functions. Their advantage lies in the fact that that one approximates the gradient as opposed to using the full Jacobian matrix. One research direction, related to this, has been on the application to infinite-dimensional problems, where one may naturally have a Hilbert space framework. However, there has been limited work done on considering this in a more general setup, such as where the natural framework is that of a Banach space. This article aims to address this by the introduction of a novel stochastic method, the stochastic steepest descent method (SSD). The SSD will follow the spirit of stochastic gradient descent, which utilizes Riesz representation to identify gradients and derivatives. Our choice for using such a method is that it naturally allows one to adopt a Banach space setting, for which recent applications have exploited the benefit of this, such as in PDE-constrained shape optimization. We provide a convergence theory related to this under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of this method on a couple of numerical applications, namely a $p$-Laplacian and an optimal control problem. Our assumptions are verified in these applications.

We prove a correspondence between Donaldson-Thomas invariants of quivers with potential having trivial attractor invariants and genus zero punctured Gromov-Witten invariants of holomorphic symplectic cluster varieties. The proof relies on the comparison of the stability scattering diagram, describing the wall-crossing behavior of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, with a scattering diagram capturing punctured Gromov-Witten invariants via tropical geometry.

Title:
Kac-Moody Symmetric Spaces: arbitrary symmetrizable complex or almost split real type
Ralf Köhl, Christian Vock
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
Kac-Moody symmetric spaces have been introduced by Freyn, Hartnick, Horn and the first-named author for centered Kac-Moody groups, that is, Kac-Moody groups that are generated by their root subgroups. In the case of non-invertible generalized Cartan matrices this leads to complications that -- within the approach proposed originally -- cannot be repaired in the affine case. In the present article we propose an alternative approach to Kac-Moody symmetric spaces which for invertible generalized Cartan matrices provides exactly the same concept, which for the non-affine non-invertible case provides alternative Kac-Moody symmetric spaces, and which finally provides Kac-Moody symmetric spaces for affine Kac-Moody groups. In a nutshell, the original intention by Freyn, Hartnick, Horn and Köhl was to construct symmetric spaces that likely lead to primitive actions of the Kac-Moody groups; this, of course, cannot work in the affine case as affine Kac-Moody groups are far from simple. Additionally, we study the Galois descent to almost split real Kac-Moody symmetric spaces based on the theory of almost split Kac-Moody groups developed by Rémy 2002.

Constrained Quantization for Uniform Distributions with Two Constraint Families
Pavjeet Singh, S. K. Katiyar, Megha Pandey, Mrinal K. Roychowdhury
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this paper, we first consider a family of constraints given by straight lines. For a uniform probability distribution, we determine the constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the corresponding $n$th constrained quantization errors for all positive integers $n$. In addition, we calculate the constrained quantization dimension and the constrained quantization coefficient with respect to this family of constraints. Next, we turn to another family of constraints, consisting of concentric circles. For the same probability distribution, we present a methodology to compute the constrained optimal sets of $n$-points and the corresponding $n$th constrained quantization errors for all positive integers $n$. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of the results and a discussion of future research directions.

We compute the $F$-pure threshold of the natural cone over flag varieties in characteristic $p>0$. Our calculations are mainly focused on flag varieties that are arithmetically Gorenstein, but we offer some results in the non-Gorenstein case. Our goal is to determine the $a$-invariant of the cone. As a result, the $F$-pure thresholds we find are independent of the characteristic $p$, hence one immediately gets the value of the log canonical threshold of flags in characteristic 0 as well.

Quantum $X$-Secure $T$-Private Information Retrieval From MDS Coded Storage With Unresponsive and Byzantine Servers

A communication-efficient protocol is introduced over a many-to-one quantum network for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, i.e., quantum private information retrieval with MDS-$X$-secure storage and $T$-private queries. The protocol is resilient to any set of up to $E$ unresponsive servers (erased servers or stragglers) and any set of up to $B$ Byzantine servers. The underlying coding scheme incorporates an enhanced version of a Cross Subspace Alignment (CSA) code, namely a Modified CSA (MCSA) code, into the framework of CSS codes. The error-correcting capabilities of CSS codes are leveraged to encode the dimensions that carry desired computation results from the MCSA code into the error space of the CSS code, while the undesired interference terms are aligned into the stabilized code space. The challenge is to do this efficiently while also correcting quantum erasures and Byzantine errors. The protocol achieves superdense coding gain over comparable classical baselines for Q-E-B-MDS-X-TPIR, recovers as special cases the state of art results for various other quantum PIR settings previously studied in the literature, and paves the way for applications in quantum coded distributed computation, where CSA code structures are important for communication efficiency, while security and resilience to stragglers and Byzantine servers are critical.

Ehrhart theory is the study of the enumeration of lattice points in lattice polytopes. Equivariant Ehrhart theory is a generalization of Ehrhart theory that takes into account the action of a finite group acting via affine transformations on the underlying lattice and preserving the polytope. We further develop equivariant Ehrhart theory in part by establishing connections with commutative algebra as well as the question of when there exists an invariant lattice triangulation of a lattice polytope.

A minimal model for prestacks and morphisms of operadic algebras via Koszul duality for box operads

Prestacks are algebro-geometric objects whose defining relations are far from quadratic. Indeed, they are cubic and quartic, and moreover inhomogeneous. Similarly, a morphism of $P$-algebras for a (nonsymmetric) Koszul operad $P$ has inhomogeneous relations possibly of any arity. We show that box operads, a rectangular type of operads introduced in arXiv:2305.20036, constitute the correct framework to encode them and resolve their relations up to homotopy. Our first main result is a Koszul duality theory for box operads, extending the duality for (nonsymmetric) operads. In this new theory, the classical restriction of being quadratic is replaced by the notion of being \emph{thin-quadratic}, a condition referring to a particular class of ``thin'' operations. Our main cases of interest are the box operad $Morph(P)$ encoding morphisms of $P$-algebras and the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. We show that both $Morph(P)$ and $Lax$ are not Koszul. We then go on to remedy the situation by suitably restricting the respective Koszul dual box cooperads $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$ and $Lax^{\antishriek}$ to obtain our two main applications. As our second main result we establish a minimal model $Morph(P)_\infty$ for the box operad $Morph(P)$ as the cobar construction on a box subcooperad $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}_{p\leq 1}$ of $Morph(P)^{\antishriek}$, hereby answering an open question by Markl in arXiv:math/0103052 (Problem 9). As expected, it encodes $\infty$-morphisms of $P_\infty$-algebras. As our third main result we establish a minimal model $Lax_{\infty}$ for the box operad $Lax$ encoding lax prestacks. This sheds new light on Markl's question on the existence of an explicit cofibrant model for the operad encoding presheaves of algebras from arXiv:math/0103052 (Conjecture 31). Indeed, we answer the parallel question with presheaves viewed as prestacks in the positive.

We provide a counterexample to a conjecture of Hildebrand which states that if $§$ has positive lower density and is stable i.e. for all $d$, $n$ is in $\mathcal{S}$ if and only if $dn$ is in $\mathcal{S}$ except on a set of density $0$ then $\mathcal{S} \cap (\mathcal{S}+1) \cap (\mathcal{S}+2)$ has positive lower density and in particular is nonempty. We further show there exists a stable set of density $1 -\frac{1}{q-1}$ such that $\mathcal{S} \cap \cdots \cap (\mathcal{S} + q -1) = \emptyset$ when $q$ is a prime, matching a bound proven by Hildebrand. Finally, we construct a function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}$ such that $f(pn) = -f(n)$ for all but a $0$ density set of $n$ depending on the prime $p$ but which fails the analogues of Sarnak and Chowla's conjectures.

Austin's moving knife procedure was originally introduced to find a consensus division of an interval/circular cake between two agents, each of whom believes that they receive exactly half of the cake. We generalise this in two ways: we consider cakes modelled by graphs, and let the two agents have unequal, arbitrary entitlements. In this setting, we seek a weighted consensus division -- one where each agent believes they received exactly the share they are entitled to -- which also minimises the number of connected components that each agent receives. First, we review the weighted consensus division of a circular cake, which gives exactly one connected piece to each agent. Next, by judiciously mapping a circle to a graph, we produce a weighted consensus division of a star graph cake that gives at most two connected pieces to each agent -- and show that this bound on the number of connected pieces is tight. For a tree, each agent receives at most h+1 connected pieces, where h is the minimal height of the tree. For a connected graphical cake, each agent receives r+2 connected pieces, where r is the radius of the graph. Finally, for a graphical cake with s connected components, the division involves at most s+2r+4 connected pieces, where r is the maximum radius among all connected components.

Data-driven h2 model reduction for linear discrete-time systems

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We present a data-driven framework for $h^{2}$-optimal model reduction for linear discrete-time systems. Our main contribution is to create optimal reduced-order models in the $h^{2}$-norm sense directly from the measurement data alone, without using the information about the original system. In particular, we focus on the fact that the gradients of the $h^{2}$ model reduction problem are expressed using the discrete-time Lyapunov equation and the discrete-time Sylvester equation, and derive the data-driven gradients. The proposed algorithm uses the output of an existing MOR as the initial point, and convergence to a stationary point is guaranteed under certain assumptions. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that, for a modeling task in neuroscience, our method constructs a reduced-order model that outperforms DMDc in terms of the $h^{2}$-norm.

Symbols for toric Eisenstein cocycles and arithmetic applications

Subjects:

Using a complex parameterizing rational spherical chains, we construct explicit cocycles for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\Q)$ valued in the motivic cohomology of (open subsets of) the algebraic $n$-torus $\mathbb{G}_m^n$. The resulting cocycles directly generalize the work of Sharifi and Venkatesh from the case $n=2$ \cite{SV}. Even in this special case, our systematic use of pushforwards allows us to avoid the use of their ``connecting sequences,'' and allows us to refine the construction and Hecke properties of the Sharifi map $\varpi$ to the maximal expected statements, while inverting only the prime $2$. For general $n$, the $d\log$ regulator of our cocycle is related by convex conical duality to cocycles constructed from Shintani cones. This affords a systematic approach to $p$-adic $L$-functions for totally real fields without need for auxiliary data or logarithm sheaf coefficients, including a distribution-valued $\GL_n(\Z)$-cocycle specializing in a simple way to all such $p$-adic $L$-functions. It moreover provides a direct conceptual link between polylogarithmic constructions of Eisenstein classes (e.g., in \cite{BKL}), and those constructed using Shintani cones (e.g., in \cite{CDG}). We also show how our formalism gives an alternate proof of the exceptional divisibilities of the Deligne-Ribet $2$-adic $L$-function in almost all cases.

Limit theorems for a strongly irreducible product of independent random matrices under optimal moment assumptions
Axel Péneau

Probability (math.PR); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Let $\nu$ be a probability distribution over the semi-group of square matrices of size $d\ge2$. We assume that $\nu$ is proximal, strongly irreducible and that $\nu^{*n}\{0\}=0$ for all $n$. We consider the sequence $\overline\gamma_n:=\gamma_0\cdots\gamma_{n-1}$ for $(\gamma_k)_{k}$ independent of distribution law $\nu$. Let $s_1\ge s_2\ge\dots s_d$ be the singular values given by the Cartan projection. We show that $(\log\frac{s_1}{s_2}(\overline{\gamma}_n))_{n}$, escapes to infinity linearly and satisfies exponential large deviations inequalities below its escape rate. This is an extension the simplicity of the top Lyapunov exponent result, proven by Guivarc'h and Raugi under a first moment assumption. We also show that the image of a generic line by $\overline{\gamma}_n$ as well as its eigenspace of maximal eigenvalue both converge to the same random line $l^\infty$ at an exponential speed.
If we moreover assume that $\nu$ is supported on the group of invertible matrices and that the push-forward distribution $N_*\nu$ is $\mathrm{L}^p$ for $N:g\mapsto\log\|g\|\|g^{-1}\|$ and for some $p>0$, then we show that $-\log d(l^\infty,H)$ is uniformly $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all proper subspace $H\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. For $p=1$, we moreover show that the rescaled logarithm of each coefficient of $\overline{\gamma}_n$ almost surely converges to the top Lyapunov exponent. This is an extension of results by Benoist and Quint which were themselves improvements of historic results by Guivarc'h, Lepage and Raugi, first proven under exponential moment assumptions.
To prove these results, we do not rely on the existence of the stationary measure nor on the existence of the Lyapunov exponent. Instead we describe an effective way to group the i.i.d. factors into i.i.d. random words that are aligned in the Cartan decomposition. We moreover have an explicit control over the moments.

We give a proof of Mukai's Theorem on the existence of certain exceptional vector bundles on prime Fano threefolds. To our knowledge this is the first complete proof in the literature. The result is essential for Mukai's biregular classification of prime Fano threefolds, and for the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions in their derived categories.
Our approach is based on Lazarsfeld's construction that produces vector bundles on a variety from globally generated line bundles on a divisor, on Mukai's theory of stable vector bundles on K3 surfaces, and on Brill--Noether properties of curves and (in the sense of Mukai) of K3 surfaces.

Comparison principles for stochastic Volterra equations

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this work, we establish a comparison principle for stochastic Volterra equations with respect to the initial condition and the drift $b$ applicable to a wide class of Volterra kernels and input curves $g$ that may be singular at zero. The latter appear, e.g., in the study of Markovian lifts for such Volterra equations. For completely monotone kernels, our result holds without any further restrictions, while for not completely monotone kernels, it is shown that such a principle fails unless the drift is additionally monotone. As a side-product of our results, we also complement the literature on the weak existence of continuous nonnegative solutions, which covers the rough Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process with singular initial conditions.

Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.

Category theory offers a mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and database systems. Popular existing approaches model a database instance as a functor into the category of sets and functions, or as a 2-functor into the 2-category of sets, relations, and implications. The functional and relational models are unified by double functors into the double category of sets, functions, relations, and implications. In an accessible, example-driven style, we show that the abstract structure of a 'double category of relations' is a flexible and expressive language in which to represent knowledge, and we show how queries on data in the spirit of Codd's relational algebra are captured by double-functorial semantics.

We first extend this theory to non-strict morphisms of monads, and to incorporate 2-cells of monads. We then further extend this to a theory of abstract Kleisli structures on 2-categories, characterising when the original pseudomonad can be recovered by the abstract Kleisli structure on its 2-category of free-pseudoalgebras.

Motivated by problems in categorical database theory, we introduce and compare two notions of presentation for profunctors, uncurried and curried, which arise intuitively from thinking of profunctors either as functors C^op x D -> Set or C^op -> Set^D. Although the Cartesian closure of Cat means these two perspectives can be used interchangeably at the semantic level, a surprising amount of subtlety is revealed when looking through the lens of syntax. Indeed, we prove that finite uncurried presentations are strictly more expressive than finite curried presentations, hence the two notions do not induce the same class of finitely presentable profunctors. Moreover, an explicit construction for the composite of two curried presentations shows that the class of finitely curried presentable profunctors is closed under composition, in contrast with the larger class of finitely uncurried presentable profunctors, which is not. This shows that curried profunctor presentations are more appropriate for computational tasks that use profunctor composition. We package our results on curried profunctor presentations into a double equivalence from a syntactic double category into the double category of profunctors. Finally, we study the relationship between curried and uncurried presentations, leading to the introduction of curryable presentations. These constitute a subcategory of uncurried presentations which is equivalent to the category of curried presentations, therefore acting as a bridge between the two syntactic choices.

We present a counterexample showing that Markov categories with conditionals (such as BorelStoch) need not validate a natural scheme of axioms which we call contraction identities. These identities hold in every traced monoidal category, so in particular this shows that BorelStoch cannot be embedded in any traced monoidal category. We remedy this under the additional assumption of atomicity: Atomic Markov categories validate all contraction identities, and furthermore admit a notion of trace defined for non-signalling morphisms. We conclude that atomic Markov categories admit an intrinsic calculus of combs without having to assume an embedding into a compact-closed category.

Aperiodic order refers to the mathematical formalisation of quasicrystals. Substitutions and cut and project sets are among their main actors; they also play a key role in the study of dynamical systems, whether they are symbolic, generated by tilings, or point sets. We focus here on the relations between quasicrystals and self-similarity from an arithmetical and dynamical viewpoint, illustrating how efficiently aperiodic order irrigates various domains of mathematics and theoretical computer science, on a journey from Diophantine approximation to computability theory. In particular, we see how Pisot numbers allow the definition of simple model sets, and how they also intervene for scaling factors for invariance by multiplication of Meyer sets. We focus in particular on the characterisation due to Yves Meyer: any Pisot or Salem number is a parameter of dilation that preserves some Meyer set.

We study projections in the bidual of a $C^*$-algebra $B$ that are null with respect to a subalgebra $A$, that is projections $p\in B^{**}$ satisfying $|\phi|(p)=0$ for every $\phi\in B^*$ annihilating $A$. In the separable case, $A$-null projections are precisely the peak projections in the bidual of $A$ at which the subalgebra $A$ interpolates the entire $C^*$-algebra $B$. These are analogues of null sets in classical function theory, on which several profound results rely. This motivates the development of a noncommutative variant, which we use to find appropriate `quantized' versions of some of these classical facts. Through a delicate generalization of a theorem of Varopoulos, we show that, roughly speaking, sufficiently regular interpolation projections are null precisely when their atomic parts are. As an application, we give alternative proofs and sharpenings of some recent peak-interpolation results of Davidson and Hartz for algebras on Hilbert function spaces, also illuminating thereby how earlier noncommutative peak-interpolation theory may be applied. In another direction, given a convex subset of the state space of $B$, we characterize when the associated Riesz projection is null. This is then applied to various important topics in noncommutative function theory, such as the F.& M. Riesz property, the existence of Lebesgue decompositions, the description of Henkin functionals, and Arveson's noncommutative Hardy spaces (maximal subdiagonal algebras).

In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a $K$ user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of the Shuffle phase of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. We approach this problem by decomposing it into distinctive stages that help identify key ingredients of the overall solution. The novel elements that emerge from the first stage, called broadcast with groupcast messages, include an outer maximum distance separable (MDS) code structure at the transmitter, and an algorithm for iteratively determining groupcast-optimal reconfigurable antenna switching patterns at the receiver to achieve intra-message (among the symbols of the same message) alignment. The next stage, called unicast with side-information, reveals optimal inter-message (among symbols of different messages) alignment patterns to exploit side-information, and by a relabeling of messages, connects to the desired MapReduce setting.

This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As concrete algorithmic applications in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we provide two illustrations based on lifted MCMC and swapping algorithm respectively to demonstrate projection samplers improve mixing over the original samplers. The projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step, and we prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm. Through simple numerical experiments on a bimodal target distribution, we show that the projection samplers mix effectively, in contrast to lifted MCMC and the swapping algorithm, which mix less well.

Organizing physics has been a long-standing preoccupation of applied category theory, going back at least to Lawvere. We contribute to this research thread by noticing that Hamiltonian mechanics and gradient descent depend crucially on a consistent choice of transformation -- which we call a reaction structure -- from the cotangent bundle to the tangent bundle. We then construct a compositional theory of reaction structures. Reaction-based systems offer a different perspective on composition in physics than port-Hamiltonian systems or open classical mechanics, in that reaction-based composition does not create any new constraints that must be solved for algebraically. The technical contributions of this paper are the development of symmetric monoidal categories of open energy-driven systems and open differential equations, and a functor between them, functioning as a "functorial semantics" for reaction structures. This approach echoes what has previously been done for open games and open gradient-based learners, and in fact subsumes the latter. We then illustrate our theory by constructing an n-fold pendulum as a composite of n-many pendula.

Pattern Runs on Matter: The Free Monad Monad as a Module over the Cofree Comonad Comonad

Interviews run on people, programs run on operating systems, voting schemes run on voters, games run on players. Each of these is an example of the abstraction pattern runs on matter. Pattern determines the decision tree that governs how a situation can unfold, while matter responds with decisions at each juncture.
In this article, we will give a straightforward and concrete construction of the free monad monad for the category of polynomial functors with the substitution monoidal product.
Although the free monad has been well-studied in other contexts, the construction we give is streamlined and explicitly illustrates how the free monad represents terminating decision trees. We will also explore the naturally arising interaction between the free monad and cofree comonad. Again, while the interaction itself is known, the perspective we take is the free monad as a module over the cofree comonad. Lastly, we will give four applications of the module action to interviews, computer programs, voting, and games. In each example, we will see how the free monad represents pattern, the cofree comonad represents matter, and the module action represents runs on.

The Schubert problem asks for combinatorial models to compute structure constants of the cohomology ring with respect to Schubert classes and has been an important open problem in algebraic geometry and combinatorics that guided fruitful research for decades. In this paper, we provide an explicit formula for the (equivariant) Schubert structure constants $c_{uv}^w$ across all Lie types when the elements $u,v,w$ are boolean. In particular, in type $A$, all Schubert structure constants on boolean elements are either $0$ or $1$.

Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.

Analysis and Simulation of a Fluid-Heat System in a Thin, Rough Layer in Contact With a Solid Bulk Domain
Tom Freudenberg, Michael Eden
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We investigate the effective coupling between heat and fluid dynamics within a thin fluid layer in contact with a solid structure via a rough surface. Moreover, the opposing vertical surfaces of the thin layer are in relative motion. This setup is particularly relevant to grinding processes, where cooling lubricants interact with the rough surface of a rotating grinding wheel. The resulting model is non-linearly coupled through(i) temperature-dependent viscosity and (ii) convective heat transport. The underlying geometry is highly heterogeneous due to the thin, rough surface characterized by a small parameter representing both the height of the layer and the periodicity of the roughness. We analyze this non-linear system for existence, uniqueness, and energy estimates and study the limit behavior within the framework of two-scale convergence in thin domains. In this limit, we derive an effective interface model in 3D (a line in 2D) for the heat and fluid interactions inside the fluid. We implement the system numerically and validate the limit problem through direct comparison with the micromodel. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the temperature-dependent viscosity and various geometrical configurations via simulation experiments. The corresponding numerical code is freely available on GitHub.

Monotone Lipschitz-Gradient Denoiser: Explainability of Operator Regularization Approaches Free From Lipschitz Constant Control

This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. Unlike the previous studies of operator regularization, our framework requires no control of the Lipschitz constant in learning the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.

Copy-composition for Probabilistic Graphical Models

In probabilistic modelling, joint distributions are often of more interest than their marginals, but the standard composition of stochastic channels is defined by marginalization. Last year at ACT, the notion of 'copy-composition' was introduced in order to circumvent this problem and express the chain rule of the relative entropy fibrationally, but while that goal was achieved, copy-composition lacked a satisfactory origin story. Here, we supply such a story for two standard probabilistic tools: directed and undirected graphical models. We explain that (directed) Bayesian networks may be understood as ''stochastic terms'' of product type, in which context copy-composition amounts to a pull-push operation. Likewise, we show that (undirected) factor graphs compose by copy-composition. In each case, our construction yields a double fibration of decorated (co)spans. Along the way, we introduce a useful bifibration of measure kernels, to provide semantics for the notion of stochastic term, which allows us to generalize probabilistic modelling from product to dependent types.

Two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for training scientific machine learning applications

We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network's feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.

We give a self-contained introduction to isolated points on curves and their counterpoint, parameterized points, that situates these concepts within the study of the arithmetic of curves. In particular, we show how natural geometric constructions of infinitely many degree d points on curves motivate the definitions of $\mathbb{P}^1$- and AV-parameterized points and explain how a result of Faltings implies that there are only finitely many isolated points on any curve. We use parameterized points to deduce properties of the density degree set and show that parameterized points of very low degree arise for a unique geometric reason. The paper includes several examples that illustrate the possible behaviors of degree d points.

Asymptotic independence in higher dimensions and its implications on risk management
Bikramjit Das, Vicky Fasen-Hartmann
Comments:

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In the study of extremes, the presence of asymptotic independence signifies that extreme events across multiple variables are probably less likely to occur together. Although well-understood in a bivariate context, the concept remains relatively unexplored when addressing the nuances of the joint occurrence of extremes in higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose a notion of mutual asymptotic independence to capture the behavior of joint extremes in dimensions larger than two and contrast it with the classical notion of (pairwise) asymptotic independence. Additionally, we define k-wise asymptotic independence, which captures the tail dependence between pairwise and mutual asymptotic independence. The concepts are compared using examples of Archimedean, Gaussian and Marshall-Olkin copulas, among others. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new notions of asymptotic independence on assessing the risk of complex systems under distributional ambiguity.

Subjects:

In the paper, we show some properties of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras related to their centers for essentially bordered pb surfaces, especially their centers, finitely generation over their centers, and their PI-degrees. The proofs are based on the quantum trace maps, embeddings of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras into quantum tori appearing in higher Teichmüller theory. Thanks to the Unicity theorem in [BG02, FKBL19], we can understand the representation theory of (reduced) stated $\mathrm{SL}(n)$-skein algebras. Moreover, the applications are beyond low-dimensional topology. For example, we can access to the representation theory of unrestricted quantum moduli algebras, and that of quantum higher cluster algebras potentially.

Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The celebrated Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem asserts that, for an ergodic map, orbits of almost every point equidistributes when sampled at integer times. This result was generalized by Bourgain to many natural sparse subsets of the integers. On the other hand, the behaviour of orbits of \textbf{all} points in a dynamical system is much less understood, especially for sparse subsets of the integers. We generalize a method introduced by A. Venkatesh to tackle this problem in two directions, general $\mathbb{R}^d$ actions instead of flows, and weak mixing, rather than mixing, actions. Along the way, we also establish some basic properties of weak mixing and show weak mixing for the time 1-map of a weak mixing flow.

Colcombet and Petrişan argued that automata may be usefully considered from a functorial perspective, introducing a general notion of "V-automaton" based on functors into V. This enables them to recover different standard notions of automata by choosing V appropriately, and they further analyzed the determinization for Rel-automata using the Kleisli adjunction between Set and Rel. In this paper, we revisit Colcombet and Petrişan's analysis from a fibrational perspective, building on Melliès and Zeilberger's recent alternative but related definition of categorical automata as functors satisfying the finitary fiber and unique lifting of factorizations property. In doing so, we improve the understanding of determinization in three regards: Firstly, we carefully describe the universal property of determinization in terms of forward-backward simulations. Secondly, we generalize the determinization procedure for Rel automata using a local adjunction between SpanSet and Rel, which provides us with a canonical forward simulation. Finally, we also propose an alternative determinization based on the multiset relative adjunction which retains paths, and we leverage this to provide a canonical forward-backward simulation.

Characterizations of the graphs with dominating parameters
Yuhan Ma
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ is a \textit{dominating set} of $G$ if every vertex in $V(G)-S$ has a neighbor in $S$. The \textit{domination number} \(\gamma(G)\) is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set of $G$. A dominating set $S$ is a \textit{total dominating set} if $N(S)$=$V$ where $N(S)$ is the neighbor of $S$. The \textit{total domination number} \(\gamma_t(G)\) equals the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of $G$. A set $D$ is an \textit{isolate set} if the induced subgragh $G[D]$ has at least one isolated vertex. The \textit{isolate number} \(i_0(G)\) is the minimum cardinality of a maximal isolate set. In this paper we study these parameters and answer open problems proposed by Hamid et al. in 2016.

Building on Buchholz' assignment for ordinals below Bachmann-Howard ordinal, see Buchholz 2003, we introduce systems of fundamental sequences for two kinds of relativized $\vartheta$-function-based notation systems of strength $\Pi^1_1{\operatorname{-CA}_0}$ and prove Bachmann property for these systems, which is essential for monotonicity properties of subrecursive hierarchies defined on the basis of fundamental sequences. The central notion of our construction is the notion of localization, which was introduced in Wilken 2007.
The first kind of stepwise defined $\vartheta$-functions over ordinal addition as basic function fits the framework of the ordinal arithmetical toolkit developed in Wilken 2007, whereas the second kind of $\vartheta$-functions is defined simultaneously and will allow for further generalization to larger proof-theoretic ordinals, see Weiermann and Wilken 2011.
The systems of fundamental sequences given here enable the investigation of fundamental sequences and independence phenomena also in the context of patterns of resemblance, an approach to ordinal notations that is both semantic and combinatorial and was first introduced by Carlson 2001 and further analyzed in Wilken 2006, 2007, and Carlson and Wilken 2012.
Our exposition is put into the context of the abstract approach to fundamental sequences developed by Buchholz, Cichon, and Weiermann 1994. The results of this paper will be applied to the theory of Goodstein sequences, extending results of Fernàndez-Duque and Weiermann 2024.

A Dynamical Equation for the Lorenz Curve: Dynamics of incomplete moments of probability distributions arising from Fokker-Planck equations

Subjects:

Fokker-Planck equations (forward Kolmogorov equations) evolve probability densities in time from an initial condition. For distributions over the real line, these evolution equations can sometimes be transformed into dynamics over the incomplete zeroth and first moments. We call this perspective the Lorenz dynamics of the system after the Lorenz curve description of distributions of wealth. This offers the benefit of presenting the dynamics over a compact domain. The integral transformation is motivated and then stated for a general class of Fokker-Planck equations. Following this, the transformed equation is solved for the heat equation and some variants thereof. Finally, some equations arising from the application of kinetic theory to idealized economic systems are transformed and analyzed in this new light.

Subjects:

The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.

Primal-dual proximal bundle and conditional gradient methods for convex problems
Jiaming Liang
Comments:

Subjects:

This paper studies the primal-dual convergence and iteration-complexity of proximal bundle methods for solving nonsmooth problems with convex structures. More specifically, we develop a family of primal-dual proximal bundle methods for solving convex nonsmooth composite optimization problems and establish the iteration-complexity in terms of a primal-dual gap. We also propose a class of proximal bundle methods for solving convex-concave nonsmooth composite saddle-point problems and establish the iteration-complexity to find an approximate saddle-point. This paper places special emphasis on the primal-dual perspective of the proximal bundle method. In particular, we discover an interesting duality between the conditional gradient method and the cutting-plane scheme used within the proximal bundle method. Leveraging this duality, we further develop novel variants of both the conditional gradient method and the cutting-plane scheme. Additionally, we report numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed proximal bundle methods in comparison with the subgradient method for solving a regularized matrix game.

To find crystals of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ representations of the form $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$ it suffices to solve the combinatorial problem of decomposing Young's lattice into symmetric, saturated chains. We review the literature on this latter problem, and present a strategy to solve it. For $n \le 4$, the strategy recovers recently discovered solutions. We obtain (i) counting formulas for plethystic coefficients, (ii) new recursive formulas for plethysms of Schur functions, and (iii) formulas for the number of constituents of $\Lambda^n\text{Sym}^r\mathbb{C}^2$.

Shameful Inequalities for List and DP Coloring of Graphs

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The chromatic polynomial of a graph is an important notion in algebraic combinatorics that was introduced by Birkhoff in 1912; denoted $P(G,k)$, it equals the number of proper $k$-colorings of graph $G$. Enumerative analogues of the chromatic polynomial of a graph have been introduced for two well-studied generalizations of ordinary coloring, namely, list colorings: $P_{\ell}$, the list color function (1990); and DP colorings: $P_{DP}$, the DP color function (2019), and $P^*_{DP}$, the dual DP color function (2021). For any graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $P_{DP}(G, k) \leq P_\ell(G,k) \leq P(G,k) \leq P_{DP}^*(G,k)$. In 2000, Dong settled a conjecture of Bartels and Welsh from 1995 known as the Shameful Conjecture by proving that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, $P(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $k \geq n-1$. In contrast, for infinitely many positive integers $n$, Seymour (1997) gave an example of an $n$-vertex graph for which the above inequality does not hold for some $k = \Theta(n/ \log n)$. In this paper, we consider analogues of Dong's result for list and DP color functions. Specifically, in contrast to the chromatic polynomial, we prove that for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, $P_{\ell}(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{\ell}(G,k)/k^n$ and $P_{DP}(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{DP}(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For the dual DP analogue of these inequalities, we show that there is a graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $P_{DP}^*(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n < P_{DP}^*(G,k)/k^n$, and we prove $P_{DP}^*(G,k+1)/(k+1)^n \geq P_{DP}^*(G,k)/k^n$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying $k \geq n-1$ when $G$ is an $n$-vertex complete bipartite graph.

We conjecture (and prove for once-punctured torus bundles) that the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of a punctured surface at roots of unity coincide with the 1-loop invariant of their mapping torus at roots of unity. This explains the topological invariance of the BWY invariants and how their volume conjecture, to all orders, and with exponentially small terms included, follows from the quantum modularity conjecture. Using the numerical methods of Zagier and the first author, we illustrate how to efficiently compute the invariants and their asymptotics to arbitrary order in perturbation theory, using as examples the $LR$ and the $LLR$ pseudo-Anosov monodromies of the once-punctured torus. Finally, we introduce descendant versions of the 1-loop and BWY invariants and conjecture (and numerically check for pseudo-Anosov monodromies of $L/R$-length at most 5) that they are related by a Fourier transform. This edition includes statements and proofs for roots of unity of all order, even and odd.

We provide new families of compact complex manifolds with no Kähler structure carrying symplectic structures satisfying the \textit{Hard Lefschetz Condition}.

By cohomological computations we prove that such manifolds carry symplectic structures satisfying the \textit{Hard Lefschetz Condition}. Furthermore, we compute the Kodaira dimension of an almost-Kähler structure and generators for the de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies.

Laplacian Eigenfunction-Based Neural Operator for Learning Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics
Jindong Wang, Wenrui Hao
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Learning reaction-diffusion equations has become increasingly important across scientific and engineering disciplines, including fluid dynamics, materials science, and biological systems. In this work, we propose the Laplacian Eigenfunction-Based Neural Operator (LE-NO), a novel framework designed to efficiently learn nonlinear reaction terms in reaction-diffusion equations. LE-NO models the nonlinear operator on the right-hand side using a data-driven approach, with Laplacian eigenfunctions serving as the basis. This spectral representation enables efficient approximation of the nonlinear terms, reduces computational complexity through direct inversion of the Laplacian matrix, and alleviates challenges associated with limited data and large neural network architectures-issues commonly encountered in operator learning. We demonstrate that LE-NO generalizes well across varying boundary conditions and provides interpretable representations of learned dynamics. Numerical experiments in mathematical physics showcase the effectiveness of LE-NO in capturing complex nonlinear behavior, offering a powerful and robust tool for the discovery and prediction of reaction-diffusion dynamics.

Title:
A new asymptotic regime for the KdV equation with Wigner-von Neumann type initial data

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation, focusing on the evolution of the radiant wave associated with a Wigner-von Neumann (WvN) resonance induced by the initial data (potential). A WvN resonance refers to an energy level where the potential exhibits zero transmission (complete reflection). The corresponding Jost solution at such energy becomes singular, and in the NLS context, this is referred to as a spectral singularity. A WvN resonance represents a long-range phenomenon, often introducing significant challenges, such as an infinite negative spectrum, when employing the inverse scattering transform (IST). To avoid some of these issues, we consider a restricted class of initial data that generates a WvN resonance but for which the IST framework can be suitably adapted. For this class of potentials, we demonstrate that each WvN resonance produces a distinct asymptotic regime -- termed the resonance regime -- characterized by a slower decay rate for large time compared to the radiant waves associated with short-range initial data.

Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks

The fluid antenna system (FAS) is a disruptive tech-nology for future wireless communication networks. This paper considers the joint optimization of beamforming matrices and antenna positions for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization in fluid antenna (FA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks, which presents significant chal-lenges due to the strong coupling between beamforming and FA positions, the non-concavity of the WSR objective function, and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method that employs matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we develop a parallel majorization maximization (MM) algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simul-taneously. To further reduce computational costs, we propose a decentralized implementation based on the decentralized base-band processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demon-strate that our proposed algorithm not only achieves significant WSR improvements over conventional MIMO networks but also outperforms the existing method. Moreover, the decentralized implementation substantially reduces computation time while maintaining similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.

Revised note on surface-link of trivial components
Akio Kawauchi
Comments:
An observation on the proof of Lemma 1.2 is added
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
It is shown that a surface-link of ribbon surface-knot components is a ribbon surface-link if and only if it is a surface-link producing a ribbon surface-link by surgery along a self-trivial 1-handle system. This corrects an earlier statement. This result makes a corrected proof for the claim that every surface-link of trivial surface-knot components with at most one aspheric component is a ribbon surface-link. For non-ribbon surface-links of trivial components with at least two aspheric components constructed in a previous note, it adds the new property that non-ribbonability continues through surgery along any self-trivial 1-handle system.

Title:
Data-driven stabilization of polynomial systems using density functions
Huayuan Huang, M. Kanat Camlibel, Raffaella Carloni, Henk J. van Waarde
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper studies data-driven stabilization of a class of unknown polynomial systems using data corrupted by bounded noise. Existing work addressing this problem has focused on designing a controller and a Lyapunov function so that a certain state-dependent matrix is negative definite, which ensures asymptotic stability of all closed-loop systems compatible with the data. However, as we demonstrate in this paper, considering the negative definiteness of this matrix introduces conservatism, which limits the applicability of current approaches. To tackle this issue, we develop a new method for the data-driven stabilization of polynomial systems using the concept of density functions. The control design consists of two steps. Firstly, a dual Lyapunov theorem is used to formulate a sum of squares program that allows us to compute a rational state feedback controller for all systems compatible with the data. By the dual Lyapunov theorem, this controller ensures that the trajectories of the closed-loop system converge to zero for almost all initial states. Secondly, we propose a method to verify whether the designed controller achieves asymptotic stability of all closed-loop systems compatible with the data. Apart from reducing conservatism of existing methods, the proposed approach can also readily take into account prior knowledge on the system parameters. A key technical result developed in this paper is a new type of S-lemma for a specific class of matrices that, in contrast to the classical S-lemma, avoids the use of multipliers.

Higher-order tacnodes in a free fermionic model
Andrea Maroncelli, Jean-Marie Stéphan
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
We investigate a one-dimensional free fermion model with nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping, evolving in imaginary time from a product state with N consecutive fermions, and conditioned to go back to the same state after a given time. Such types of models are quantum reformulations of well-studied two-dimensional classical lattice models, which are known to give rise to limit shapes where expectation values of simple local observables, such as density, depend on position in an appropriate scaling limit. In the case of only nearest neighbor hopping, this model is known to have two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Correlations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. Here we show that another universal higher-order tacnode process can appear upon including the next-nearest neighbor term. We also discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile.

Weighted Orlicz $*$-algebras on locally elliptic groups

Let $G$ be a locally elliptic group, $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions, and $\omega: G \rightarrow [1,\infty)$ a weight function on $G$ such that the weighted Orlicz space $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra when equipped with the convolution product and involution $f^*(x):=\overline{f(x^{-1})}$ ($f \in L^\Phi(G,\omega)$). Such a weight always exists on $G$ and we call it an $L^\Phi$-weight. We assume that $1/\omega \in L^\Psi(G)$ so that $L^\Phi(G,\omega) \subseteq L^1(G)$. This paper studies the spectral theory and primitive ideal structure of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$. In particular, we focus on studying the Hermitian, Wiener and $*$-regularity properties on this algebra, along with some related questions on spectral synthesis. It is shown that $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is always quasi-Hermitian, weakly-Wiener and $*$-regular. Thus, if $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is Hermitian, then it is also Wiener. Although, in general, $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is not always Hermitian, it is known that Hermitianness of $L^1(G)$ implies Hermitianness of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ if $\omega$ is sub-additive. We give numerous examples of locally elliptic groups $G$ for which $L^1(G)$ is Hermitian and sub-additive $L^\Phi$-weights on these groups. In the weighted $L^1$ case, even stronger Hermitianness results are formulated.

We investigate the ground states of neutron stars and white dwarfs in the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theories. It is known that the system is stable below a critical mass, which depends on the gravitational constant, while it becomes unstable if the total mass exceeds the critical mass. We prove that if the total mass is at the critical mass, then the HFB minimizers do not exist for any gravitational constant, while the HF minimizers exist for every gravitational constant except for a countable set, which is fully characterized by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for orthonormal systems. Our results complement the existence results in the sub-critical mass case established in [E. Lenzmann and M. Lewin, Duke Math. J., 2010].

Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex

Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. However, their five degeneracy relations are in fact redundant. In the present paper, we unify these five conditions into a single degeneracy condition and resolve the issue of the well-definedness of the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex. This provides an appropriate definition of the Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the usual Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a consequence, we obtain an alternative proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.

On an alternating sum of factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind: trees, lattices, and games

We study an alternating sum involving factorials and Stirling numbers of the first kind. We give an exponential generating function for these numbers and show they are nonnegative and enumerate the number of increasing trees on $n$ vertices that are won by the second of two players when interpreted as a game tree. We also give a simple description of the quotient from the weak order to the Tamari lattice in terms of plane trees, and give bijections between plane trees, 213-avoiding permutations, and 312-avoiding permutations. Finally, for a rooted tree, we give equivalent characterizations of when it describes a game won by the first or second player in terms of the rank-generating function of the lattice of prunings and the Euler characteristic of an associated real variety.

Frozen Gaussian Grid-point Correction For Semi-classical Schrödinger Equation
Lihui Chai, Zili Deng
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm named the frozen Gaussian grid-point correction (FGGC) for computing the Schrödinger equation in the semi-classical regime using the frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA). The FGA has demonstrated its superior efficiency in dealing with semi-classical problems and high-frequency wave propagations. However, reconstructing the wave function from a large number of Gaussian wave-packets is typically computationally intensive. This difficulty arises because these wave-packets propagate along the FGA trajectories to non-grid positions, making the application of the fast Fourier transform infeasible. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``on-grid correction'' and derive the formulas for the least squares approximation of Gaussian wave-packets, and also provide a detailed process of the FGGC algorithm. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the error introduced by the least squares approximation on each Gaussian wave-packet is independent of the semi-classical parameter $\varepsilon$. Numerical experiments show that the FGGC algorithm can significantly improve reconstruction efficiency while introducing only negligible error, making it a powerful tool for solving the semi-classical Schrödinger equation, especially in applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency.

Low-complexity Detection for Noncoherent Massive MIMO Communications
Marc Vilà-Insa, Jaume Riba
Comments:
This work has been submitted to Springer for possible publication
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
This work studies a point-to-point MIMO uplink in which user equipment transmits data to a base station equipped with a massive array. Signal detection is noncoherent and fading is assumed to follow the Weichselberger model. By exploiting the spatial stationarity of fading at the base station, a cyclostationary structure emerges naturally in the space-time representation, which suggests formulating the statistical properties of the received signal in the Karhunen-Loève domain. This allows the derivation of a low-complexity receiver that approximates maximum likelihood detection even for a moderate array size. The spectral analysis of the problem provides valuable insights on the design of space-time codewords.

Locally analytic vectors in the completed cohomology of unitary Shimura curves

Comments:
v2: 91 pages, minor updates. Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We use the methods introduced by Lue Pan to study the locally analytic vectors in the completed cohomology of unitary Shimura curves. As an application, we prove a classicality result on two-dimensional regular $\sigma$-de Rham representations of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$ appearing in the locally $\sigma$-analytic vectors of the completed cohomology, where $L$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $\sigma:L\hookrightarrow E$ is an embedding of $L$ into a sufficiently large finite extension $E$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We also prove that if a two-dimensional representation of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$ appears in the locally $\sigma$-algebraic vectors of the completed cohomology then it is $\sigma$-de Rham. Finally, we give a geometric realization of some locally $\sigma$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$. This realization has some applications to the $p$-adic local Langlands program, including a locality theorem for Galois representations arising from classical automorphic forms, an admissibility result for coherent cohomology of Drinfeld curves, and some special cases of the Breuil's locally analytic Ext$^1$-conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$.

Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models

Subjects:

If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

On the multiplicity of Knot Floer order under cabling
David Suchodoll
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
The knot Floer order $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ is a knot invariant derived from knot Floer homology that provides bounds on many other invariants, such as the bridge index $\operatorname{br}(K)$ for which $\operatorname{Ord}(K) + 1 \leq \operatorname{br}(K)$. For all $(p,q)$-cables of L-space knots, we show that $\operatorname{Ord}(K) + 1$ is multiplicative in $p$ when $g(K) > 1$, and the same holds for $g(K) = 1$ provided $q > 2p$. We also compute the knot Floer order in the range $q < 2p$, thereby determining $\operatorname{Ord}(K_{p,q})$ in terms of $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ for all cables of L-space knots. We establish upper bounds under cabling for $\operatorname{Ord}(K)$ and discuss potential applications to a conjecture by Krishna and Morton, proving that the braid index of an L-space cable appears as an exponent in its Alexander polynomial if it does for its companion, provided $\operatorname{Ord}(K)+1$ is multiplicative.

Optimal Non-Adaptive Group Testing with One-Sided Error Guarantees
Daniel McMorrow, Jonathan Scarlett
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
The group testing problem consists of determining a sparse subset of defective items from within a larger set of items via a series of tests, where each test outcome indicates whether at least one defective item is included in the test. We study the approximate recovery setting, where the recovery criterion of the defective set is relaxed to allow a small number of items to be misclassified. In particular, we consider one-sided approximate recovery criteria, where we allow either only false negative or only false positive misclassifications. Under false negatives only (i.e., finding a subset of defectives), we show that there exists an algorithm matching the optimal threshold of two-sided approximate recovery. Under false positives only (i.e., finding a superset of the defectives), we provide a converse bound showing that the better of two existing algorithms is optimal.

Fluid Antenna Systems Meet Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are widely regarded as a cornerstone of the emerging low-altitude economy, yet they face significant challenges, including rapidly varying channels, diverse functional requirements, and dynamic interference environments. Fluid antenna (FA) systems introduce spatial reconfigurability that complements and extends conventional beamforming, enabling flexible exploitation of spatial diversity and adaptive response to channel variations. This paper proposes a novel architecture for FA-empowered LAWNs and presents a case study demonstrating substantial improvements in communication, sensing, and control performance compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Key practical deployment considerations are examined, including mechanical design, position control, energy efficiency, and compliance with emerging industry standards. In addition, several future research directions are highlighted, including intelligent optimization, multi-function integration, and the exploration of novel low-altitude applications. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical deployment perspectives, this paper establishes FA systems as a key enabler for adaptive, efficient, and resilient network infrastructures in next-generation LAWNs.

Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn); Probability (math.PR)
We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) for non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The approach is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we derive ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ in the two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a general fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we analyze the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we further analyze non-Hermitian Rosenzweig-Porter model which recently attracted considerable interest in physics literature. In addition, we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier emerging as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.

We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety of arbitrary dimension over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove that the set of log discrepancies for a fixed exponent is discrete. Additionally, we show that the set of log canonical thresholds (lcts) of multi-ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic is contained within the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth variety over the complex number field. As a result, we find that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational if all the exponents are rational. We also obtain ACC for the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth varieties in positive characteristic.

A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)
We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.

In this paper we introduce the notion of (pointed) prenormal category, modelled after regular categories, but with the key notions of coequaliser and kernel pair replaced by those of cokernel and kernel. This framework provides a natural setting for extending certain classical results in algebra. We study the fundamental properties of prenormal categories, including a characterisation in terms of a factorisation system involving normal epimorphisms, and a categorical version of Noether's so-called `third isomorphism theorem'. We also present a range of examples, with the category of commutative monoids constituting a central one. In the second part of the paper we extend prenormality and its related properties to the non-pointed context, using kernels and cokernels defined relative to a distinguished class of trivial objects.

Let $\mathcal{M}_{n,a}$ be the set consisting of involutions in symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ with exactly $a$ fixed points and apply the orbit harmonics method to obtain a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n$-module $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Liu, Ma, Rhoades, and Zhu figured out a signed combinatorial formula for the graded Frobenius image $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$. Our goal is to cancel these signs. Finally, we find two positive combinatorial formulae for $\mathrm{grFrob}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$, yielding potential ways to find a linear basis for $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$ and find a statistic $\mathrm{stat}:\mathcal{M}_{n,a}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ to interpret the Hilbert series $\mathrm{Hilb}(R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a});q)$ of $R(\mathcal{M}_{n,a})$.

Spatial Stark-Zeeman Systems and Their Regularizations
Seongchan Kim, Kevin Ruck
Comments:
Minor revisions, accepted for publication in the Mathematische Zeitschrift
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
In this article, we study spatial Stark-Zeeman systems which describe the dynamics of a charged particle moving in three-dimensional space under the influence of a Coulomb potential, a magnetic field, and an electric field, possibly time-dependent. Such systems are modeled by Hamiltonian flows on the cotangent bundle of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3, $ equipped with a twisted symplectic structure. The presence of the Coulomb singularity leads to the study of collision orbits, and hence understanding the regularization of these orbits is essential for global dynamical properties.
We investigate regularization techniques for spatial Stark-Zeeman systems, both in time-independent and time-dependent cases. In particular, in the time-dependent case, following a new regularization method developed by Barutello, Ortega, and Verzini, we formulate the corresponding regularized variational principles and carefully analyze the effects of magnetic and electric terms under the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. The resulting regularized action functional yields a variational characterization of collision orbits and facilitates further analysis of periodic solutions.
Our results provide a general scheme for regularizing spatial Stark-Zeeman systems, opening the door for further applications in symplectic geometry, Floer theory, and celestial mechanics.

We characterize the collection of sets $E \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ for which there exists $\theta \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ such that the distance weight $w(x) = \operatorname{dist}(x, E)^\theta$ belongs to the Muckenhoupt class $A_p$, where $p > 1$. These sets exhibit a certain balance between the small-scale and large-scale pores that constitute their complement$-$a property we show to be more general than the so-called weak porosity condition, which in turn, and according to recent results, characterizes the sets with associated distance weights in the $A_1$ case. Furthermore, we verify the agreement between this new characterization and the properties of known examples of distance weights, that are either $A_p$ weights or merely doubling weights, by means of a probabilistic approach that may be of interest by itself.

In this article we study the algebraic structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups, plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups, Selmer groups, and plus/minus Selmer groups in the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of abelian number fields. As a first, we prove theorems on the equivariant structure of fine Mordell--Weil groups and plus/minus Mordell--Weil groups. In other words, we study the explicit shape of the fine, plus/minus objects as a $\Lambda(\mathcal{G})$-module with $\mathcal{G} \simeq \mathbb{Z}_p \times G$ and $G$ a finite abelian group. We prove refinements of previously known results over $\mathbb{Q}$ for the classical Selmer group and the plus/minus Selmer group, and subsequently also the Shafarevich--Tate group, and the plus/minus Shafarevich--Tate group. This gives new evidence towards an affirmative answer for the Kurihara--Pollack problem.

Title:
Weil representations associated to isocrystals over function fields
Maxim Mornev, Richard Pink
Comments:
67 pages; grant numbers updated
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Every Anderson $A$-motive $M$ over a field determines a compatible system of Galois representations on its Tate modules at almost all primes of $A$. This adapts easily to $F$-isocrystals, which are rational analogues of $A$-motives for the global function field $F:=\operatorname{Quot}(A)$. We extend this compatible system by constructing a Weil group representation associated to $M$ for every place of $F$. To this end we generalize the Tate module construction to a tensor functor on $F_{\mathfrak{p}}$-isocrystals that are not necessarily pure. To prove that this yields a compatible system, we work out how that construction behaves under reduction of $M$. As an offshoot we obtain a new kind of $\wp$-adic Weil representations associated to Drinfeld modules of special characteristic $\wp$.

Multicycle dynamics and high-codimension bifurcations in SIRS epidemic models with cubic psychological saturated incidence

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This study investigates bifurcation dynamics in an SIRS epidemic model with cubic saturated incidence, extending the quadratic saturation framework established by Lu, Huang, Ruan, and Yu (Journal of Differential Equations, 267, 2019). We rigorously prove the existence of codimension-three Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations and degenerate Hopf bifurcations, demonstrating the coexistence of three limit cycles within a single epidemiological model, a phenomenon that is rarely documented and exhibits significant dynamical complexity. Our analysis reveals that both the infection rate $\kappa$ (through specific inequality conditions) and psychological effect thresholds critically govern disease dynamics: from complete eradication to various persistence patterns, including multiple periodic oscillations and coexistent steady states. By innovatively applying singularity theory, we characterize the topology of the bifurcation set through the local unfolding of singularities and the identification of nondegenerate singularities for fronts. Numerical simulations verify the emergence of three limit cycles in monotonic parameter regimes and two limit cycles in nonmonotonic regimes. This work advances existing bifurcation research by incorporating higher-order interactions and comprehensive singularity analysis, thereby providing a mathematical foundation for decoding complex transmission mechanisms critical to the design of public health strategies.

Double-functorial representation of regular monoidal structures
José Siqueira
Comments:
61 pages
Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT); Logic (math.LO)
It is well-known that pseudo functors from bicategories of spans are equivalent to Beck-Chevalley bifibrations, and therefore capture the relationships underlying the adjunctions suitable as semantics for existential quantification. This was further expanded upon by Dawson, Paré and Pronk in the context of double categories. By viewing hyperdoctrines from a double-categorical lens, this paper shows that we can also characterise the Frobenius property: (generalised) regular hyperdoctrines correspond to those lax symmetric monoidal double pseudofunctors from spans to quintets whose monoidal laxators provide companion commuter cells (in the sense of Paré). This suggests a new notion of regular double hyperdoctrine. As an application, we discuss how we can recover a form of graphical regular logic suitable for modelling specifications of systems (e.g., port-plugging systems) that compose operadically.

A Shiu Theorem for Larger and Smoother Functions
Thomas Wright
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In this paper, we broaden Shiu's Brun-Titchmarsh theorem to allow for functions that are larger and/or smooth-supported. In particular, let $f$ be a nonnegative multiplicative function. We prove that if there exists a $\beta<1$ such that $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$ for every prime $p$ and every $l>1$, and if $f(n)\ll \max\{n^\epsilon,(\log x)^\epsilon\}$ for every $\epsilon>0$, then $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{y}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)$$ for every $\epsilon_0>0$, where $x$, $y$, and $k$ are as they were in Shiu's original paper and $(a,k)=1$. Moreover, we prove that if $f$ is a $Q$-smooth-supported function then there exists a constant $C$ for which $$\sum_{\substack{x\leq n\leq x+y \\ n\equiv a\pmod k}}f(n)\ll \frac{y}{\phi(k)(\log x)^{1-\epsilon_0}}\exp\left(\sum_{\substack{p\leq x \\ p\nmid k}}\frac{f(p)}{p}\right)\rho(u)^C,$$ where $u=\frac{\log x}{\log Q}$, $\rho$ is the Dickman-de Bruijn function, and $C$ depends on whether we choose the bound of $f(p^l)\leq A_1^l$ or $f(p^l)\ll (\log\log x)^{l\beta}$.
We also give applications to both the divisor function to large powers and to smooth numbers in short intervals.

Subjects:

In this paper, for $0<\alpha<1$, $p>0$ and positive semidefinite matrices $A,B\ge0$, we consider the quasi-extension $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=((1-\alpha)A^p+\alpha B^p)^{1/p}$ of the $\alpha$-weighted arithmetic matrix mean, and the quasi-extensions $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B):=\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A^p,B^p)^{1/p}$ of several different $\alpha$-weighted geometric-type matrix means $\mathcal{M}_\alpha(A,B)$ such as the $\alpha$-weighted geometric mean in Kubo and Ando's sense and two types of $\alpha$-weighted version of Fiedler and Pták's spectral geometric mean, as well as the Rényi mean and the $\alpha$-weighted Log-Euclidean mean. For these we examine the inequalities $\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\alpha,p}(A,B)\triangleleft\mathcal{A}_{\alpha,q}(A,B)$ of arithmetic-geometric type, where $\triangleleft$ is one of several different matrix orderings varying from the strongest Loewner order to the weakest order determined by trace inequality. For each choice of the above inequalities, our goal is to hopefully obtain the necessary and sufficient condition on $p,q,\alpha$ under which the inequality holds for all $A,B\ge0$.

Global existence of the irrotational Euler-Norstrom equations with a positive cosmological constant: The gravitational field equation
Uwe Brauer, Lavi Karp
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Our objective is to demonstrate the global existence of classical solutions for the nonlinear irrotational Euler-Nordstroem system, which includes a linear equation of state and a cosmological constant. In this framework, the gravitational field is represented by a single scalar function that satisfies a specific semi-linear wave equation. We focus on spatially periodic deviations from the background metric, which is why we study the semi-linear wave equation on the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ within the Sobolev spaces $H^m(\mathbb{T}^3)$. This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the Nordstroem equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid governed by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full coupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid with a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstroem equation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity precludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work \cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy estimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Instead, we develop an appropriate energy functional and establish the corresponding energy estimates tailored to the wave equation under consideration.

Isogeometric Topology Optimization Based on Topological Derivatives

Subjects:

Topology optimization is a valuable tool in engineering, facilitating the design of optimized structures. However, topological changes often require a remeshing step, which can become challenging. In this work, we propose an isogeometric approach to topology optimization driven by topological derivatives. The combination of a level-set method together with an immersed isogeometric framework allows seamless geometry updates without the necessity of remeshing. At the same time, topological derivatives provide topological modifications without the need to define initial holes [7]. We investigate the influence of higher-degree basis functions in both the level-set representation and the approximation of the solution. Two numerical examples demonstrate the proposed approach, showing that employing higher-degree basis functions for approximating the solution improves accuracy, while linear basis functions remain sufficient for the level-set function representation.

Expressive Power of Deep Networks on Manifolds: Simultaneous Approximation
Hanfei Zhou, Lei Shi
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in Hölder-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

On the Squared Distance Matrix of a Starlike Block Graph
Joyentanuj Das, Sumit Mohanty
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of a simple connected graph $G$. The Hadamard product $D(G)~\circ~ D(G)$ is called the squared distance matrix of $G$, and is denoted by $\Delta(G)$. A simple connected graph is called a starlike block graph if it has a central cut vertex, and each of its blocks is a complete graph. Let $ \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b)$ be the starlike block graph with blocks $K_{n_1+1}, K_{n_2+1}, \ldots, K_{n_b+1} $ on $n=1 + \sum_{i=1}^b n_i$ vertices. In this article, we compute the determinant of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$ and find its inverse as a rank-one perturbation of a positive semidefinite Laplacian-like matrix $\mathcal{L}$ with rank $n-1$. We also investigate the inertia of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$. Furthermore, for a fixed value of $ n $ and $ b $, we determine the extremal graphs that uniquely attain the maximum and minimum spectral radius of the squared distance matrix for starlike block graphs on $ n $ vertices and $ b $ blocks.

A Framework for Connecting G-Expectations and Rough Paths via Parameterized Control
Guangqian Zhao
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This work proposes a framework for exploring the profound connection between G-expectation and Rough Paths Theory. We initiate this program by constructing a parameterized control representation and establishing an injective homomorphism between the space of G-random variables and families of classical random variables. Building on this, we outline a promising path-space formulation inspired by Rough Paths Theory, suggesting that G-expectations can ultimately be represented as deterministic functionals. This synthesis provides a new perspective and a clear roadmap for future research in model uncertainty.

Colorful circuits and colorful topes in oriented matroids
Minho Cho, Seunghun Lee, Frédéric Meunier
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We provide a short proof of a conic version of the colorful Carathéodory theorem for oriented matroids. Holmsen's extension of the colorful Carathéodory theorem to oriented matroids (Advances in Mathematics, 2016) already encompasses several generalizations of the original result, but not its conic version. Our approach relies on a common generalization of Sperner's lemma and Meshulam's lemma-two closely related results from combinatorial topology that have found a number of applications in discrete geometry and combinatorics. This generalization may be of independent interest.
Using a similar approach, we also establish the following colorful theorem for topes, whose special geometric case had not been considered before: Given $n$ topes from a uniform oriented matroid with $n$ elements, if they agree on some element, then there is a way to select a distinct element from each tope, together with its sign, so as to form another tope of the oriented matroid. Motivated by this theorem, we further explore other conditions leading to the same conclusion.

To cover a permutohedron
Bochao Kong, Ji Zeng
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The permutohedron $P_n$ of order $n$ is a polytope embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose vertex coordinates are permutations of the first $n$ natural numbers. It is obvious that $P_n$ lies on the hyperplane $H_n$ consisting of points whose coordinates sum up to $n(n+1)/2$. We prove that if the vertices of $P_n$ are contained in the union of $m$ affine hyperplanes different from $H_n$, then $m\geq n$ when $n \geq 3$ is odd, and $m \geq n-1$ when $n \geq 4$ is even. This confirms a recent conjecture of Hegedüs and Károlyi. Our proof gives an algebraic criterion for a non-standard permutohedron generated by $n$ distinct real numbers to require at least $n$ non-trivial hyperplanes to cover its vertices.

This paper presents a novel method for solving Fokker-Planck equations by learning neural samplers via a weak adversarial framework. We represent the solution distribution through a neural pushforward map, bypassing the limitations of density-based methods. A key innovation is our use of computationally efficient plane-wave test functions, whose derivatives are explicitly computed -- a treatment distinct from prior work. This approach handles distributions without densities and naturally enforces probability conservation.

Subjects:

A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.

Compactness and least energy solutions to the super-Liouville equation on the sphere

In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.

In 1959, Kolmogorov proposed to study the instability of the shear flow $(\sin(y),0)$ in the vanishing viscosity regime in tori $\mathbb{T}_{\alpha}\times \mathbb{T}$. This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} > \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.

Let $X$ be a compact oriented CR manifold of dimension $2n+1$, $n \ge 1$, with a nondegenerate Levi form of constant signature $(n_-, n_+)$. Suppose that condition $Y(q)$ holds at each point of $X$, we establish the small time asymptotics of the heat kernel of Kohn Laplacian. Suppose that condition $Y(q)$ fails, we establish the small time asymptotics of the kernel of the difference of the heat operator and Szegő projector. As an application we define the analytic torsion on a compact oriented CR manifold of dimension $2n+1$, $n \ge 1$, with a nondegenerate Levi form. Let $L^k$ be the $k$-th power of a CR complex line bundle $L$ over $X$. We also establish asymptotics of the analytic torsion with values in $L^k$ under certain natural assumptions.

Radon-Nikodym derivative of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation

We show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of the spatial increments (with endpoints away from the origin) of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation (LPP) with non-decreasing initial data against the Wiener measure $\mu$ on compacts is in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$; and for any fixed $p>1$, the $L^p$ norm is at most of the order $O_p(\mathrm{e}^{d_pm^2\log m})$ for some $p$-dependent constant $d_p>0$.
Furthermore, when the initial data is homogeneous, we establish optimal growth on $L^p$ norms ($\asymp O(\exp(dm^2))$) of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the Brownian LPP (i.e. top line of an $m$-level Dyson Brownian motion) away from the origin, as the number of curves $m$ tends to infinity, for all $p>1$ sufficiently large.
As an application of our framework, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of certain toy models for the KPZ fixed point lies in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$, inspired by its variational characterisation in terms of the directed landscape.

We construct spectrum-level splittings of $BPGL \langle 1 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 1 \rangle$ at all primes $p$, where $BPGL \langle 1 \rangle$ is the first truncated motivic Brown--Peterson spectrum. Classically, $BP\langle 1 \rangle \wedge BP\langle 1 \rangle$ was first described by Kane and Mahowald in terms of Brown-Gitler spectra. This splitting was subsequently reinterpreted by Lellman and Davis-Gitler-Mahowald in terms of Adams covers. In this paper, we give motivic lifts of these splittings in terms of Adams covers, over the base fields $\mathbb{C}, \, \mathbb{R},$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\mathbb{F}_q \neq p$. As an application, we compute the $E_1$-page of the $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$-based Adams spectral sequence as a module over $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$, both in homotopy and in terms of motivic spectra. We also record analogous splittings for $BPGL \langle 0 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 0 \rangle$.

Within the field of optimal experimental design, \emph{sensor placement} refers to the act of finding the optimal locations of data collecting sensors, with the aim to optimise reconstruction of an unknown parameter from finite data. In this work, we investigate sensor placement for the inverse problem of reconstructing a heat source given final time measurements. Employing forward and adjoint analysis of this PDE-driven model, we show how one can leverage the first author's recently invented \emph{redundant-dominant $p$-continuation} algorithm to obtain binary A-optimal sensor placements also for this time-dependent model.

By systematically translating certain integrals involving moments of the elliptic integral into $L$-values of modular forms on $\Gamma_1(4), \Gamma(4)$ and $\Gamma_1(8)$, and then utilizing relations among the critical $L$-values of cuspidal newforms, we obtain a dimension formula for the space spanned by these integrals.

SU(N) integrals and tau functions

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We present a family of solvable multi-matrix models associated with an arbitrary embedded graph $\Gamma$ with a single vertex. The graph with $n$ edges is equipped with $2n$ corner matrices. The partition function of each member of the family depends on the set of eigenvalues of monodromies of corner matrices around the vertices of the dual graph $\Gamma^*$ and sets of parameters attached to each vertex of $\Gamma$. We select the cases where the partition function of a model is a tau function of KP, 2KP and BKP hiearachies. We compare integrals over ${U}(N)$ and over ${SU}(N)$ groups. In $U(N)$ case there is no restriction on the number of vertices of $\Gamma$.

First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.

Ferromagnetic ground states have often been overlooked in comparison to seemingly more interesting antiferromagnetic ground states. However, both the physical and mathematical structure of ferromagnetic ground states are particularly rich. We show that the highly degenerate and highly entangled ground states of the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model are scale invariant, originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking from ${\rm SU}(3)$ to ${\rm U}(1)\times {\rm U}(1)$ with two type-B Goldstone modes if the system size is even or from ${\rm SU}(2)$ to ${\rm U}(1)$ with one type-B Goldstone mode if the system size is odd, when periodic boundary conditions are adopted. The ground state degeneracies are characterized as Fibonacci-Lucas sequences, under open and periodic boundary conditions, with nonzero residual entropy per site. This implies that the ground state degeneracies for this model are asymptotically the golden spiral. In addition, sequences of atypical (periodic) degenerate ground states generated from highest and generalized highest weight states are constructed to establish that the entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size in the thermodynamic limit. The prefactor is half the number of type-B Goldstone modes, which is identified to be the fractal dimension, if one is restricted to atypical degenerate ground states. We also argue that the same conclusion is valid for typical (non-periodic) degenerate ground states, as long as the block size is sufficiently large.

We propose a new definition of higher-order DisCoCat (categorical compositional distributional) models where the meaning of a word is not a diagram, but a diagram-valued higher-order function. Our models can be seen as a variant of Montague semantics based on a lambda calculus where the primitives act on string diagrams rather than logical formulae. As a special case, we show how to translate from the Lambek calculus into Peirce's system beta for first-order logic. This allows us to give a purely diagrammatic treatment of higher-order and non-linear processes in natural language semantics: adverbs, prepositions, negation and quantifiers. The definition presented in this article comes with a proof-of-concept implementation in DisCoPy, the Python library for string diagrams.

We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future.

Upon verifying relevant coherence conditions, ViCAR gives a set of lemmas and tactics for manipulating categorical structures. We also provide a visualizer that can display any composition and tensor product of morphisms as a string diagram, showing its categorical structure.

In multi-parameter quantum metrology, the resource of entanglement can lead to an increase in efficiency of the estimation process. Entanglement can be used in the state preparation stage, or the measurement stage, or both, to harness this advantage; here we focus on the role of entangling measurements. Specifically, entangling or collective measurements over multiple identical copies of a probe state are known to be superior to measuring each probe individually, but the extent of this improvement is an open problem. It is also known that such entangling measurements, though resource-intensive, are required to attain the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks. In this work we investigate the maximum precision improvement that collective quantum measurements can offer over individual measurements for estimating parameters of qudit states, calling this the 'collective quantum enhancement'. We show that, whereas the maximum enhancement can, in principle, be a factor of $n$ for estimating $n$ parameters, this bound is not tight for large $n$. Instead, our results prove an enhancement linear in dimension of the qudit is possible using collective measurements and lead us to conjecture that this is the maximum collective quantum enhancement in any local estimation scenario.

Estimating joint distributions (a.k.a. couplings) over counterfactual outcomes is central to personalized decision-making and treatment risk assessment. Two emergent frameworks with identifiability guarantees are: (i) bijective structural causal models (SCMs), which are flexible but brittle to mis-specified latent noise; and (ii) optimal-transport (OT) methods, which avoid latent noise assumptions but can produce incoherent counterfactual transports which fail to identify higher-order couplings. In this work, we bridge the gap with \emph{counterfactual cocycles}: a framework for counterfactual transports that use algebraic structure to provide coherence and identifiability guarantees. Every counterfactual cocycle corresponds to an equivalence class of SCMs, however the cocycle is invariant to the latent noise distribution, enabling us to sidestep various mis-specification problems. We characterize the structure of all identifiable counterfactual cocycles; propose flexible model parameterizations; introduce a novel cocycle estimator that avoids any distributional assumptions; and derive mis-specification robustness properties of the resulting counterfactual inference method. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and noise-robustness of counterfactual cocycles across synthetic benchmarks and a 401(k) eligibility study.

We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.

The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

Traditional theories of optimization cannot describe the dynamics of optimization in deep learning, even in the simple setting of deterministic training. The challenge is that optimizers typically operate in a complex, oscillatory regime called the "edge of stability." In this paper, we develop theory that can describe the dynamics of optimization in this regime. Our key insight is that while the *exact* trajectory of an oscillatory optimizer may be challenging to analyze, the *time-averaged* (i.e. smoothed) trajectory is often much more tractable. To analyze an optimizer, we derive a differential equation called a "central flow" that characterizes this time-averaged trajectory. We empirically show that these central flows can predict long-term optimization trajectories for generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these central flows, we are able to understand how gradient descent makes progress even as the loss sometimes goes up; how adaptive optimizers "adapt" to the local loss landscape; and how adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards regions where they can take larger steps. Our results suggest that central flows can be a valuable theoretical tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.

The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its theoretical properties are still not well understood. As with classic neural networks, a common approach to improve these models is to increase their size and depth. However, such strategies may be suboptimal, as several works have shown that adding more layers yields increasingly diminishing returns. More importantly, prior studies have shown that increasing depth may lead to model collapse, i.e., all the tokens converge to a single cluster, undermining the ability of LLMs to generate diverse outputs. Building on differential equation models for the transformer dynamics, we prove that all the tokens in a transformer asymptotically converge to a cluster as depth increases. At the technical level we leverage tools from control theory, including consensus dynamics on manifolds and input-to-state stability (ISS). We then extend our analysis to autoregressive models, exploiting their structure to further generalize the theoretical guarantees.

We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space, focusing on the location of Borel singularities and the value of the associated Stokes constants. We find in particular that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D-brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity, and the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge of the D-brane, in as far as its value is known, coincides with the Stokes constant associated to the Borel singularity.

Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration using a Monotonic Neural Network Ensemble

Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.

A Quotient Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)
Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\sim_\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \textit{overlap decomposition} $\mathcal{O}_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\Phi(\mathcal{M})) \simeq H_k(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{O}_\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Neuromorphic Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a theoretical approach to designing better user experiences (UX) motivated by advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain. Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.

Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.

Subjects:
Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Probability (math.PR); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.

Quantifying the dynamic structural resilience of international staple food trade networks: An entropy-based approach
Si-Yao Wei, Wei-Xing Zhou
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Establishing a resilient food trade system is an international consensus on safeguarding food security amid growing disruptions. However, a unified resilience framework has yet to be established, leading to the proliferation of diverse measures. Here, we conceptualize resilience as a trade-off between efficiency and redundancy and employ an entropy-based approach to quantify the dynamic structural resilience of international trade networks for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat from 1986 to 2022. Using index decomposition analysis, we also investigate the relative contributions of internal components to resilience dynamics. Within this framework, despite heterogeneity across different food commodities, we find that current trade networks are relatively redundant, with improvements in efficiency being the dominant driver of changes in resilience. In addition, we reveal a historically pronounced impact of flow concentrations on resilience, while trade interactions have become increasingly important in recent years. Following the leave-one-out approach, we furthermore identify critical economies and trade relationships that disproportionately affect the overall resilience, some of which are less well-focused in previous studies. Moreover, we highlight that overconcentration of flows along core trade relationships may undermine both efficiency and resilience, whereas peripheral trade networks may play strategic alternative roles in sustaining resilience, underscoring the importance of concentrating on developing economies and promoting broader trade links. These findings not only provide new insights for assessing the resilience of international food trade systems but also propose directions for strengthening resilience through both regional cooperation and more inclusive trade relations.

In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.

We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, study non-adiabatic features in the dynamics of a three-level time-dependent detuning model, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.

The Cluster Deletion problem takes a graph $G$ as input and asks for a minimum size set of edges $X$ such that $G-X$ is the disjoint union of complete graphs. An equivalent formulation is the Clique Partition problem, which asks to find a partition of $V(G)$ into cliques such that the number of edges in the cliques is maximized.
We begin by giving a much simpler proof of a theorem of Gao, Hare, and Nastos that Cluster Deletion is efficiently solvable on the class of cographs. We then investigate Cluster Deletion and Clique Partition on permutation graphs, which are a superclass of cographs. Our findings suggest that Cluster Deletion may be NP-hard on permutation graphs.
Finally, we prove that for graphs with clique number at most $c$, there is a $\frac{2\binom{c}{2}}{\binom{c}{2}+1}$-approximation algorithm for Clique Partition. This is the first polynomial time algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio better than 2 for graphs with bounded clique number. More generally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time on any graph class for which Maximum Clique can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide a class of examples which shows that our approximation ratio is best possible.

Why and When Deep is Better than Shallow: An Implementation-Agnostic State-Transition View of Depth Supremacy

Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast>1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Title:
Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations

Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any given time to solve many problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, that generalises both VIM width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both VIM and TIM width which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. In doing this, we provide a characterisation of problems in FPT with respect to both parameters. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, dominating set, matching, and edge deletion to limit maximum reachability.

A Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation without Projections or Strong Convexity

We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning.
We are interested in the so-called ``robust'' setting, where the convergence guarantee does not depend on the minimal curvature of the potential function.
While prior work has established convergence guarantees in this setting, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is projected onto a bounded set, a condition that is both artificial and does not match the current practice.
In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such an assumption and present a refined analysis of TD learning. For the first time, we show that the simple projection-free variant converges with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

Title:
Improved Scaling Laws in Linear Regression via Data Reuse
Licong Lin, Jingfeng Wu, Peter L. Bartlett
Subjects:

Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Empirical Analysis Of Heuristic and Approximation Algorithms for the The Mutual-Visibility Problem
Vanja Stojanović, Bor Pangeršič
Subjects:
Computational Geometry (cs.CG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Performance (cs.PF); Combinatorics (math.CO)
The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms -- a direct random heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic algorithm -- on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless, validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.

Barvinok's interpolation method meets Weitz's correlation decay approach
Ferenc Bencs, Guus Regts
Subjects:
Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper we take inspiration from Weit'z algorithm for approximating the independence polynomial to provide a new algorithm for computing the coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithm of the independence polynomial. Hereby we provide a clear connections between Barvinok's interpolation method and Weitz's algorithm. Our algorithm easily extends to other graph polynomials and partition functions and we illustrate this by applying it to the chromatic polynomial and to the graph homomorphism partition function. Our approach arguably yields a simpler and more transparent algorithm than the algorithm of Patel and the second author.
As an application of our algorithmic approach we moreover derive, using the interpolation method, a deterministic $O(n(m/\varepsilon)^{7})$-time algorithm that on input of an $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph of minimum degree at least $3$ and $\varepsilon>0$ approximately computes the number of sink-free orientations of $G$ up to a multiplicative $\exp(\varepsilon)$ factor.

Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering

Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.

Systematic Constraint Formulation and Collision-Free Trajectory Planning Using Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets

In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult. Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) enable us to generate minimum distance collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver. We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard GCS formulation when the environment is static, as well as globally optimal trajectories in cluttered dynamic environments.

ML-PWS: Estimating the Mutual Information Between Experimental Time Series Using Neural Networks

The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

We re-derive an exact analytic three-parameter expressions for the non-rotating metric, describing a Taub-NUT-like black hole (BH), and its associated bumblebee field that are solutions to the Einstein-bumblebee gravity. We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not affect its thermodynamic topological classification.

Exploiting Non-Markovian Memory Effects for Robust Quantum Teleportation

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence, which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM) with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.

Random close packing fraction of bidisperse discs: Theoretical derivation and exact bounds
Raphael Blumenfeld
Comments:
5 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:

A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.
