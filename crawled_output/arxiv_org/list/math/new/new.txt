Title:
On Time-Like Class $\mathcal A$ Surfaces in a Static Space Time
Furkan Kaya, Nurettin Cenk Turgay
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
In this paper, we consider time-like surfaces in the static space-time given by the warped product $\mathbb L^3_1(c)\, _f\times (I,dz^2)$, where $\mathbb L^3_1(c)$ denotes the Lorentzian space form with the constant sectional curvature $c\in\{-1,0,1\}$. In particular, we study the surfaces with light-like $\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)^T$. First, we construct a globally defined pseudo-orthonormal frame field on a surface satisfying this condition and deal with the invariants associated with this frame field. Then, we obtain a complete classification theorem for class~$\mathcal A$ surfaces. Finally, we consider some applications of this theorem.

Title:
Modules over the category of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies
Mai Katada

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Geometric Topology (math.GT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
The linear category $\mathbf{A}$ of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies was introduced by Habiro and Massuyeau. We study the category of modules over the category $\mathbf{A}$. We generalize the adjunction given by Powell to an adjunction between the category of $\mathbf{A}$-modules and the category of modules over the linear PROP for Casimir Lie algebras by using the category $\mathbf{A}^{L}$ of extended Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies. Then we study subquotient $\mathbf{A}$-modules of $\mathbf{A}(0,-)$.

Title:
Lifting of cycles in functional graphs
Tadahisa Nara
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Number Theory (math.NT)
For a given function from a set to itself, we can define a directed graph called the functional graph, where the vertices are the elements of the set, and the edges are all the pairs of inputs and outputs for the function. In this article we consider functional graphs on Z/mZ with respect to polynomial functions. The main result describes the behavior of cycles in functional graphs on Z/p^nZ while $n$ is increasing, where $p$ is a prime number.

Title:
Similarity as Thermodynamic Work: Between Depth and Diversity -- from Information Distance to Ugly Duckling
Kentaro Imafuku
Comments:
19 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Defining similarity is a fundamental challenge in information science. Watanabe's Ugly Duckling Theorem highlights diversity, while algorithmic information theory emphasizes depth through Information Distance. We propose a statistical-mechanical framework that treats program length as energy, with a temperature parameter unifying these two aspects: in the low-temperature limit, similarity approaches Information Distance; in the high-temperature limit, it recovers the indiscriminability of the Ugly Duckling theorem; and at the critical point, it coincides with the Solomonoff prior. We refine the statistical-mechanical framework by introducing regular universal machines and effective degeneracy ratios, allowing us to separate redundant from core diversity. This refinement yields new tools for analyzing similarity and opens perspectives for information distance, model selection, and non-equilibrium extensions.

Title:
Off Critical Zeros Contradict Contraction in the Dynamical Reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis
Hendrik Wladimir Albrecht Edwin Kuipers
Comments:
Part II of a two paper project on dynamical reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis. 12 pages, 5 appendices. Companion to Part I: Dynamical Reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis via Trajectory Contraction (arXiv:2509.10588v1)
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We continue the dynamical reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis initiated in [1]. The framework is built from an integer map in which composites advance by pi(m) and primes retreat by their prime gap, producing trajectories whose contraction properties encode the distribution of primes. In this setting, RH is equivalent to the persistence of contraction inequalities for trajectory-based error functionals E(X), E~(X) across multiplicative scales.
In the present paper we prove that if zeta(s) has a zero off the critical line Re(s)=1/2, then the Landau--Littlewood Omega-theorem forces oscillations of size x^beta in psi(x)-x. A window-capture lemma shows that these oscillations are inherited by the composite-only window suprema Esup(X), and hence by E(X), producing lower bounds that contradict contraction. Thus any off--critical zero is incompatible with contraction.
Headline result. Part I introduced the dynamical system and showed that RH is equivalent to the persistence of contraction inequalities. Part II proves that off--critical zeros force oscillations in psi(x)-x that inevitably violate contraction. Taken together, these two steps close the circle: contraction characterizes RH, and off--critical zeros contradict contraction. Hence every nontrivial zero of zeta(s) lies on the critical line. In particular, the Riemann Hypothesis holds.
More generally, the present result shows that whenever contraction holds, the critical line is forced as the only location of nontrivial zeros. In this sense, the critical line is not merely the conjectured locus of zeros, but the equilibrium point singled out by contraction itself.

Title:
Nonlocal modeling of spatial fractional diffusion with truncated interaction domains and truncated kernel function singularity
Shiping Zhou, Yanzhi Zhang, Max Gunzburger
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are in ubiquitous, very effective use to model diffusion processes. However, there are many applications (e.g., such as in hydrology, animal foraging, biology, and light diffusion just do name a few) for which results obtained through the use of parabolic PDEs do not agree with observations. In many situations the use of fractional diffusion models has been found to be more faithful to that which is observed. Specifically, we replace the Laplacian operator in the PDE by a fractional Laplacian operator ${\mathcal L}$ which is an integral operator for which solutions are sought for on all of space, has an unbounded domain of integration, and for a given point $x$ the integrand contains a kernel function $\phi(y-x)$ that is infinite whenever $y=x$.
These three features pose impediments not only for the construction of efficient discretization methods but also because all three involve one or more sort of "infinity''. To overcome these impediments we choose to invoke one or more of the following strategies. (a) We seek solutions only within a chosen bounded domain $\Omega$. (b) For every $x\in\Omega$, we choose a bounded domain of integration such as, e.g., an Euclidean ball $B_\delta(x)$ having finite radius $\delta$. (c) We truncate the singularity of $\phi(y-x)$ by setting, for a given constant $\varepsilon>0$, $\phi(y-x)= \phi(\varepsilon)$ whenever $|y-x|\le\varepsilon$.
We then provide extensive illustrations of the possible combinations chosen from among (a), (b), and (c). We also illustrate, for the various models defined for each of these combinations, their limiting behavior of solutions such as showing that as $\delta\to0$ we recover the PDE model and also showing that in the limit of some other parameters we recover the fractional Laplacian model.

Title:
Bilinear Differential-Difference Equations and One-Point Distributions of Some KPZ-Class Models
C. Alexander Rodriguez
Comments:
36 pages, 4 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We introduce a collection of nonlinear integrable partial differential-difference equations that are satisfied by the one-point distribution functions of some classical integrable KPZ models. Moreover, these equations can be regarded as reparametrizations or as scaling limits of the Hirota bilinear difference equation (HBDE), a canonical discretization for many important integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, and the two-dimensional Toda lattice (2DTL). Our contributions are threefold: (i) general Fredholm determinant solutions; (ii) verification that known formulas for classical integrable KPZ models fit within our framework; and (iii) zero-curvature/Lax pair formulations. As an application, we derive formal scaling limits of the equations, including the KP limit under 1:2:3 KPZ scaling.

Hopf algebra maps taking chromatic symmetric functions to their graph complements
Shao Yuan Lin, Laura Pierson
Comments:
25 pages, comments welcome!
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Cho and van Willigenburg (arXiv:1508.07670) and Alinaeifard, Wang, and van Willgenburg (arXiv:2010.00147) introduce multiplicative chromatic bases for the ring $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions, consisting of the chromatic symmetric functions (CSFs) of a sequence of connected graphs $G_1,G_2,\dots$ such that $G_n$ has total weight $n$, together with the CSFs of their disjoint unions. In arXiv:1707.04058, Tsujie introduces an alternative ring structure $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ on the vector space $\Lambda$ that makes CSFs multiply over joins instead of over disjoint unions. The $\widetilde{m}_\lambda$ basis, consisting of all CSFs of weighted cliques, is a multiplicative basis for $\widetilde{\Lambda}$, as is the $r_\lambda$ basis of complete multipartite graphs studied by Penaguiao (arXiv:1803.08824) and Crew and Spirkl (arXiv:2009.14141). We show that one can get more of these "cochromatic bases" (where the starting graphs are combined by joins instead of disjoint unions, hence forming a multiplicative basis for $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ instead of $\Lambda$) if and only if the starting graphs are edgeless. We also show that $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ is a Hopf algebra with the same coproduct as $\Lambda$, and that many of the chromatic bases for $\Lambda$ generated by cliques can be taken to their corresponding cochromatic bases via Hopf algebra isomorphisms $\Lambda \to \widetilde{\Lambda}.$ We also show that there is a single Hopf algebra morphism taking the CSFs of all unweighted triangle-free graphs to the CSFs of their complements, and we give several more conditions and examples for when one can or cannot find Hopf algebra maps taking the CSFs of certain graphs to the CSFs of their complements. Finally, we show that $K$-analogues of many of the above statements also hold if one instead uses the Kromatic symmetric function (KSF) defined by Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (arXiv:2301.02177).

Title:
Smooth perfectness of Hamiltonian diffeomorphism groups
Oliver Edtmair
Comments:
41 pages, 12 figures
Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
A fundamental result of Banyaga states that the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group of a closed symplectic manifold is perfect. We refine this result by proving that, locally in the $C^\infty$ topology, the number of commutators needed to express a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is bounded, and the commutators can be chosen to depend smoothly on the diffeomorphism. As a corollary, we show that any homogeneous quasimorphism on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group is continuous in the $C^\infty$ topology. We establish an analogous smooth perfectness result for compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of open symplectic manifolds, where Banyaga proved that the kernel of the Calabi homomorphism is perfect. For symplectic manifolds with boundary, we define a natural group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms that need not restrict to the identity on the boundary. We extend the Calabi homomorphism to this setting and prove a corresponding refined perfectness result. These results are motivated by our work on symplectic packing stability for symplectic manifolds with boundary, where they play a key role in our symplectic embedding constructions.

Large-time Behavior for a Cutoff Level-Set Mean Curvature G-equation with Source term
Adrian D. Calderon
Comments:
24 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider a cutoff level-set mean curvature G-equation with a non-negative source term. In particular, we study the large-time behavior of this fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic partial differential equation in two settings: periodic and radially symmetric. Due to the non-coercivity and non-convexity of the Hamiltonian, we are not able to use the standard Hamilton-Jacobi theory and instead rely on the inherent structure to find a monotonicity property and corresponding uniqueness set. Lastly, we discuss the local regularity of the solutions, as well as a representation formula in the radial symmetric setting.

The Sunflower-Free Process
Patrick Bennett, Amanda Priestley
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
An $r$-sunflower is a collection of $r$ sets such that the intersection of any two sets in the collection is identical. We analyze a random process which constructs a $w$-uniform $r$-sunflower free family starting with an empty family and at each step adding a set chosen uniformly at random from all choices that could be added without creating an $r$-sunflower with the previously chosen sets. To analyze this process, we extend results of the first author and Bohman arXiv:1308.3732v5 [math.CO], who analyzed a general random process which adds one object at a time chosen uniformly at random from all objects that can be added without creating certain forbidden subsets.

Central values of Asai L-functions and twisted Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture: relative trace formulas
Weixiao Lu, Danielle Wang, Zhiyu Zhang
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We study certain new relative trace formulas on (non-reductive) period integrals involving Weil representations, in the context of the relative Langlands program. We study normal representatives using Galois theory, and establish geometric decompositions of relative trace formulas using normal representatives for good test functions. By comparing global representatives, local distributions and orbital integrals, we prove the twisted Gan--Gross--Prasad (GGP) conjecture on Asai L-functions, in any dimension under some local assumptions, allowing ramifications of number fields.

p-adic dynamical systems for $p$-adic $λ$-models on the Cayley trees
Farrukh Mukhamedov, Otabek Khakimov
Comments:
23 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We review and propose to use of associated dynamical system to explore the phase transition phenomena in $p$-adic statistical mechanics setting, by means of the renormalization techniques. Main focus of the paper is the $p$-adic $\lambda$-model on the Cayley tree. We study generalized $p$-adic quasi Gibbs measures for the $\lambda$-model. These measures associate recurrence equations that determine dynamical systems for the model. A main point is to verify and confirm that the indicated predictions from a dynamical system point of view are indeed true.

A Regularized Riccati Recursion for Interior-Point Optimal Control
João Sousa-Pinto, Dominique Orban
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Mathematical Software (cs.MS); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
We derive a closed-form extension of Riccati's recursion for solving regularized LQR problems. We also show how this can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We also provide MIT-licensed implementations of our method in C++ and JAX.

Sparse Regression LDPC Codes for the Block-Fading Non-Coherent SIMO Channel
Alexander Fengler, Burak Çakmak, Giuseppe Caire
Comments:
37 pages, 7 figures, submitted for publication
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Sparse regression codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes that encode information through the superposition of columns of a randomised coding matrix. The combination with an outer non-binary low density parity check (NB-LDPC) code was recently shown to improve the finite-length performance of these codes over the unfaded AWGN channel. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that is capable of decoding NB-LDPC encoded SPARCs on a Rayleigh fading channel with multiple receive antennas. Notably, the decoder does not require channel state information (CSI), i.e., it is fully non-coherent, but achieves the same error probability as a decoder with full CSI, even for moderate block lengths. This is achieved by iteratively re-estimating the channel throughout the decoding iterations. In addition, we provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of both the block error probability and the channel estimation error. Numerical results confirm the precision of the analysis and show that the presented coding scheme performs within 1.5 dB of the outage capacity and is competitive with coded modulation schemes employing standardised LDPC codes for 5G cellular networks and pilot-based channel estimation.

Stokes' theorem as an entropy-extremizing duality
Daniel Lazarev

Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Information Theory (cs.IT); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Given a manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider all subsets of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfy the generalized Stokes' theorem and show that $\partial\mathcal{M}$ maximizes the associated information theoretic entropy functional. This provides an information theoretic characterization of the duality expressed by Stokes' theorem, whereby the boundary of a manifold is the `least informative' subset of the manifold satisfying the Stokes relation.

The Hom-Ext quiver and applications to exceptional collections
Kiyoshi Igusa, Ray Maresca
Comments:
35 pages, 2 figures, and several diagrams
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study what we call the Hom-Ext quiver and characterize it as a type of 'superquiver'. In type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, the Hom-Ext quiver of an exceptional set is the tiling algebra of the corresponding geometric model. And, in that case, Hom-Ext quivers classify exceptional sets up to Dehn twist of the corresponding geometric model. We show that these Dehn twists are realized by twist functors and give autoequivalences of the derived category. We provide a generating set for the group of autoequivalences of the derived category in type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, and show that the Hom-Ext quiver classifies exceptional sets up to derived autoequivalence. We introduce superquivers, which are a generalization of Hom-Ext quivers. Exceptional sets over finite acyclic quivers are realized as representations of superquivers. Throughout, we list several questions and conjectures that make for, what we believe, exciting new research.

A Class of De Giorgi Type and Hölder Continuity for Some Problems in Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev Spaces
Hlel Missaoui, Anouar Bahrouni, Hichem Ounaies
Comments:
40 pages
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we introduce a new class of De Giorgi type functions, denoted by \(\mathcal{B}_{G(x,t)}\), and establish the Hölder continuity of its elements under suitable additional assumptions on the generalized \textnormal{N}-function \(G(x,t)\). As an application, we prove the Hölder continuity of solutions to quasilinear equations whose principal part is in divergence form with \(G(x,t)\)-growth conditions, including both critical and standard growth cases. The novelty of our work lies in the generalization of the Hölder continuity results previously known for variable exponent \cite[X, Fan and D. Zhao]{Fan1999} and Orlicz \cite[G. M. Lieberman]{Li1991} problems. Moreover, our results encompass a wide variety of quasilinear equations.

The theme of this paper is to compute hermitian $K$-groups in terms of the recently developed theory of Milnor-Witt motivic cohomology. Our approach makes use of the very effective slice spectral sequence within the motivic stable homotopy category, which we analyze in detail for base schemes of arithmetic interest. We show a Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, determine the map between Milnor-Witt and hermitian $K$-theory up to degree five for all fields, and compute the hermitian $K$-groups and the higher Witt-groups of the ring of integers.

Joint inviscid, incompressible, and continuous phenotype limit in nonlocal models of tissue growth
Chen-Chih Lai, Hongbo Lu
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We rigorously derive the joint limit of vanishing viscosity, singular pressure, and discrete-to-continuous phenotype structure in a class of tissue growth models. Starting from a viscoelastic (Brinkman-type) system describing multiple interacting phenotypes, where pressure depends nonlinearly on total cell density, we establish convergence to an incompressible Darcy-type model with a continuous phenotypic structure. Our analysis builds upon recent advances on the Brinkman-to-Darcy limit and incompressible transitions by David, Jacob, and Kim [arXiv:2503.18870], and on hydrodynamic limits for phenotype-structured populations by Debiec, Mandal, and Schmidtchen [J. Differential Equations 2025]. A key novelty lies in combining all three singular limits simultaneously, under uniform a priori estimates, compactness in space-phenotype-time, and a generalized entropy-dissipation structure. This provides a unified framework for modeling constrained tissue growth with mechanical feedback and phenotypic plasticity.

The discrete Laplace asymptotic method and its application to the 3XOR satisfiability problem
Jared A. Hughes, J. William Helton, Peter Schlosser
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A standard way to calculate the asymptotic behavior of integrals of the form \int_Wg(x)e^{-nh(x)}dx is the (continuous) Laplace asymptotic method. However, also discrete sums like \sum_{x\in W\cap\Lambda_n}g_n(x)e^{-nh_n(x)} have similar behavior, when \Lambda_n is a discrete grid which becomes infinitely fine, and the functions g_n and h_n converge to g and h respectively. We go even further, and also derive the asymptotic formula for sums of the form \sum_{x\in W\cap\Lambda_n}S_n(x), where the summand S_n asymptotically behaves as g_ne^{-nh_n}. The motivation, and also an immediate application, will be filling in all details in the classical breakthrough paper of Dubois and Mandler from 2002, which gives the solvability (phase transition) threshold of the 3XOR-SAT problem using the second moment method. Various analytical arguments there were lightly described, but the appendix of this paper combines recent results to fill all of them in. We would expect our theorems on asymptotics to apply to other (especially combinatorial) problems as well. For example, they seem effective on 3XOR-GAME problems.

Code distances: a new family of invariants of linear codes
Eduardo Camps-Moreno, Elisa Gorla, Hiram H. López
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper, we introduce code distances, a new family of invariants for linear codes. We establish some properties and prove bounds on the code distances, and show that they are not invariants of the matroid (for a linear block code) or $q$-polymatroid (for a rank-metric code) associated to the code. By means of examples, we show that the code distances allow us to distinguish some inequivalent MDS or MRD codes with the same parameters. We also show that no duality holds, i.e., the sequence of code distances of a code does not determine the sequence of code distances of its dual. Further, we define a greedy and an asymptotic version of code distances. Finally, we relate these invariants to other invariants of linear codes, such as the maximality degree, the covering radius, and the partial distances of polar codes.

For hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, including important physical models from continuum mechanics, the question of stability for large data solutions remains a challenging open problem. In recent work (arXiv:2507.23645) the authors introduce a framework for showing Hölder stability of potentially "wild" large data solutions, relative to a class of BV solutions, for systems with two conserved quantities. This is referred to as "weak-BV" stability. In this paper, we give a short introduction to the methods while applying them to the "full" Euler system with three conserved quantities. We discuss applications to future work for higher systems with additional conserved quantities.

As a consequence, the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture holds for all intervals up to length 8 in Weyl groups and up to length 10 in type $A$ Weyl groups.

Non-isentropic cavity flow for the multi-d compressible Euler system
Helge Kristian Jenssen, Charis Tsikkou
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We rigorously construct non-isentropic and self-similar multi-d Euler flows in which a central cavity (vacuum region) collapses. While isentropic flows of this type have been analyzed earlier by Hunter \cite{hun_60} and others, the non-isentropic setting introduces additional complications, in particular with respect to the behavior along the fluid-vacuum interface. The flows we construct satisfy the physical boundary conditions: the interface is a material surface along which the pressure vanishes, and it propagates with a non-vanishing and finite acceleration until collapse.
We introduce a number of algebraic conditions on the parameters in the problem (spatial dimension, adiabatic index, similarity parameters). With these conditions satisfied, a simple argument based on trapping regions for the associated similarity ODEs yields the existence of non-isentropic cavity flows. We finally verify that the conditions are all met for several physically relevant cases in both two and three dimensions.

Approximation properties of operator coorbit spaces and sparsity classes
Monika Dörfler, Lukas Köhldorfer, Franz Luef, Henry McNulty
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Extensions of coorbit spaces for functions to operators have been introduced by two different groups in \cite{doelumcskr24} and \cite{köbaLOC25}, where one is based on the coorbit theory of Feichtinger-Gröchening while the other is based on the theory of localized frames. We show that for certain Gabor g-frames the co-orbit spaces in \cite{köbaLOC25} conincide with the ones in \cite{doelumcskr24} and we refer to this class of operators as operator coorbit spaces. Based on the description of operator coorbit spaces in terms of Gabor g-frames we provide operator dictionaries for these spaces that allow us to define sparsity classes in this setting. We establish that these sparsity classes also coincide with the operator coorbit spaces, which holds, in particular for all Feichtinger operators, a nice class of mixed states. Numerical examples confirm the expected approximation quality by few terms for appropriately chosen operators.

However, ARO makes previous constraints that were independent of uncertainty now dependent, making it vulnerable to additional infeasibilities when realizations fall outside the uncertainty set. This phenomenon of adaptive policies being brittle is analogous to overfitting in machine learning. To mitigate against this, we propose assigning constraint-specific uncertainty set sizes, with harder constraints given stronger probabilistic guarantees. Interpreted through the overfitting lens, this acts as regularization: tighter guarantees shrink adaptive coefficients to ensure stability, while looser ones preserve useful flexibility. This view motivates a principled approach to designing uncertainty sets that balances robustness and adaptivity.

Mixtures, Markov bridges and the matrix product ansatz

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
We give a probabilistic characterization of the set of measures that can be represented by the matrix product ansatz. By suitably enlarging the state space, we show that a probability measure can be described in terms of non negative matrices by the {\it Matrix Product Ansatz}, if and only if it can be written as a mixture of inhomogeneous product measures where the mixing law is a Markov bridge. We give a constructive procedure to identify such probabilistic features. We illustrate the result by examples and show that existing probabilistic representations of the invariant measures of non equilibrium interacting particle systems can be obtained from the matrix product ansatz by this general procedure.

We study asymptotic behavior of the stability thresholds of a big line bundle, and prove explicit bounds on the error terms. This answers Jin--Rubinstein--Tian's questions affirmatively. A key step in our proof is to show that the stability thresholds of a big line bundle can always be computed by quasi-monomial valuations. This generalizes Blum--Jonsson's result on the stability thresholds of an ample line bundle.

Finite element approximation of the stationary Navier-Stokes problem with non-smooth data
María Gabriela Armentano, Mauricio Mendiluce
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The aim of this work is to analyze the finite element approximation of the stationary Navier-Stokes equations with non-smooth Dirichlet boundary data. The discrete approximation is obtained by considering the Navier-Stokes system with a regularized boundary solution. Based on the existence of the very weak solution for the Navier-Stokes system with L2 boundary data, and a suitable decomposition of this solution, we obtain a priori error estimates between the approximation of the Navier-Stokes system with non-smooth data and the finite element solution of the associated regularized problem. These estimates allow us to conclude that our approach converges with optimal order.

Bicolored bosonic solvable lattice models
Talia Blum
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Recent papers in solvable lattice models emphasize models where states can be visualized as colored paths through the lattice. We define a bosonic model in which there are two types of colors, one whose paths move down and to the right, the other whose paths move down and to the left. Depending on their boundary data, systems may have no states, exactly one state, or many states. We prove that these cases depend on a criterion involving two permutations extracted from the boundary data and their Bruhat order. This classification also helps us to characterize the partition functions of our systems, a question at the heart of the study of solvable lattice models. Using the solvability of the model, we derive a four-term recurrence relation on the partition function. Together with the classification of systems by number of states which serves as a base case for the recursion, the recursion completely characterizes the partition function of systems. We also show a color merging property relating the bicolored bosonic models to colored and uncolored bosonic models, and correspondence with Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.

Existence, uniqueness and construction of locally most reliable two-terminal graphs
Pablo Romero
Comments:
Submitted
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A two-terminal graph is a graph G equipped with two vertices in V(G) called terminals. Let T(n,m) be the set of two-terminal graphs on n vertices and m edges. Let G be in T(n,m) and let p be in [0,1]. The two-terminal reliability of G at p, denoted R_G(p), is the probability that G has a path joining its terminals after each of its edges is independently removed with probability 1 - p. We say G is a locally most reliable two-terminal graph (LMRTTG) if for each H in T(n,m) there exists a positive real number delta such that for every p in (0, delta) it holds that R_G(p) >= R_H(p).
It is simple to prove that there exists a unique LMRTTG in T(n,m) when n >= 4 and 5 <= m <= 2n - 3. Gong and Lin [Discrete Appl. Math. 356 (2024), 393-402] further proved that there exists a unique LMRTTG in T(n,m) when n >= 6 and 2n - 3 <= m <= n(n - 1)/2, except for some pairs of integers n and m which satisfy that n >= 6 and (1/2)(n - 2)(n - 3) - (n - 2)/2 <= m - (2n - 3) <= (1/2)(n - 2)(n - 3) + (n - 2)/2. All cases unresolved in earlier works are covered here. In this article it is proved that in each set T(n,m) such that n >= 4 and 5 <= m <= n(n - 1)/2 there exists a unique LMRTTG, called G(n,m). A construction of G(n,m) is also given.

Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Let $\Sigma$ be an orientbale closed surface and let $\Sigma'$ be a nonorientable closed surface. In the paper, we show that for any nontrivial orientable $S^2$ fiber bundles $X= \Sigma \ltimes S^2$ and $X' = \Sigma' \ltimes S^2$, there are surjective homomorphisms from both $MCG_0(X)$ and $MCG_0(X')$ to $\mathbb{Z}^{\infty}$. The proof is an application of generalization of Dax invariants for embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds. The property of $MCG_0(X)$ and $MCG_0(X')$ inherits from trivial fiber bundle $\Sigma \times S^2$.

We obtain tight bounds for the minimal number of generators of an ideal with bounded-degree generators in a polynomial ring $K[X_1,\dots,X_n],$ as well as a sharp quantification of the maximum possible size of a minimal generating set of bounded degree. Our bounds are sharp for all fields of size greater than the degree. Moreover, we provide explicit constructions reaching the tightness constraints for all fields of characteristic 0, and for all sufficiently large fields in the one- and two-variable case. Additionally, we fully solve the one-variable case, and conjecture the asymptotics in the multivariate case, for all finite fields.

Among the main results, for any $\ell\in \mathbb C$ we construct a universal vacuum $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-module $\mathcal{V}_A(\ell)$ of level $\ell$, prove that there exists a natural $\hbar$-adic weak quantum vertex algebra structure on $\mathcal{V}_A(\ell)$, and give an isomorphism between the category of restricted $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-modules of level $\ell$ and the category of $\mathcal{V}_A(\ell)$-modules.

Bayesian distributionally robust variational inequalities: regularization and quantification
Wentao Ma, Zhiping Chen, Xiaojun Chen
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose a Bayesian distributionally robust variational inequality (DRVI) framework that models the data-generating distribution through a finite mixture family, which allows us to study the DRVI on a tractable finite-dimensional parametric ambiguity set. To address distributional uncertainty, we construct a data-driven ambiguity set with posterior coverage guarantees via Bayesian inference. We also employ a regularization approach to ensure numerical stability. We prove the existence of solutions to the Bayesian DRVI and the asymptotic convergence to a true solution as sample size grows to infinity and the regularization parameter goes to zero. Moreover, we derive quantitative stability bounds and finite-sample guarantees under data scarcity and contamination. Numerical experiments on a distributionally robust multi-portfolio Nash equilibrium problem validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness and reliability of Bayesian DRVI solutions in practice.

Two-stage Bootstrap Percolation
Zihao Fang, Janko Gravner, David Sivakoff
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We introduce and study two variants of two-stage growth dynamics in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with state space $\{0,1,2\}^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$. In each variant, vertices in state $0$ can be changed irreversibly to state $1$, and vertices in state $1$ can be changed permanently to state $2$. In the standard variant, a vertex flips from state $i$ to $i+1$ if it has at least two nearest-neighbors in state $i+1$. In the modified variant, a $0$ changes to a $1$ if it has both a north or south neighbor and an east or west neighbor in state $1$, and a $1$ changes to a $2$ if it has at least two nearest-neighbors in state $2$. We assume that the initial configuration is given by a product measure with small probabilities $p$ and $q$ of $1$s and $2$s. For both variants, as $p$ and $q$ tend to $0$, if $q$ is large compared to $p^{2+o(1)}$, then the final density of $0$s tends to $1$. When $q$ is small compared to $p^{2+o(1)}$, for standard variant the final density of $2$s tends to $1$, while for the modified variant the final density of $1$s tends to $1$. In fact, for the modified variant, the final density of $2$s approaches $0$ regardless of the relative size of $q$ versus $p$. These results remain unchanged if, in either variant, a $1$ changes to a $2$ only if it has both a north or south neighbor and an east or west neighbor in state $2$. An essential feature of these dynamics is that they are not monotone in the initial configuration.

Exponents of $2$-multiarrangements and Wakefield--Yuzvinsky matrices

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
In the theory of hyperplane arrangements, M. Wakefield and S. Yuzvinsky utilized a square matrix in their research on the exponents of $2$-dimensional multiarrangements. Using such a matrix, they showed that the exponents of $2$-dimensional multiarrangements are as close as possible in general position for any fixed balanced multiplicity. In this article, we introduce a matrix similar to that of Wakefield and Yuzvinsky and explore its further application to the exponents. In fact, exponents of $2$-dimensional multiarrangements are calculated by verifying whether the corresponding matrices have full rank. As the main result, we introduce a new class of $2$-dimensional arrangements with an explicit sequence of multiplicities for which the exponents are closest. We also provide an alternative proof for some known results on exponents.

For a non-decreasing sequence of positive integers $S = (a_1, a_2,\ldots)$, the $S$-packing chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that the vertices can be colored with $k$ colors, where the distance between any two distinct vertices of color $i$ is greater than $a_i$. In this paper, we show that the $S$-packing chromatic number of the infinite diagonal grid $P_\infty \boxtimes P_\infty$ with $S = (1,6,6,\ldots)$ is $40$. This confirms a conjecture of the first author and Tiyajamorn.

This paper presents a unified framework for studying dynamics and integration on $q$-cosymplectic manifolds. After outlining the geometric foundations of $q$-cosymplectic structures, we derive new results concerning integrable systems and the characterization of Liouville coordinates, and further investigate the Lie integrability of $q$-evolution systems in this setting. We then develop a Hamilton--Jacobi theory tailored to multi-time Hamiltonian systems, both from an intrinsic geometric perspective and via symplectification techniques. To illustrate the applicability of the framework, we construct a $q$-cosymplectic Hamiltonian model for an extended FitzHugh-Nagumo system, providing a biologically relevant example involving three distinct temporal scales.

Double Yangians and lattice quantum vertex algebras

Subjects:

For any simply-laced GCM $A$, a $\mathbb C[[\hbar]]$-algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$ was introduced in [KL1], where it was proved that the universal vacuum $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-module ${\mathcal{V}}_A(\ell)$ for any fixed level $\ell$ is naturally an $\hbar$-adic weak quantum vertex algebra. Let $L$ be the root lattice of $\mathfrak g(A)$. As the main results of this paper, we construct an $\hbar$-adic quantum vertex algebra $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$ as a formal deformation of the lattice vertex algebra $V_L$ and show that every $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$-module is naturally a restricted $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-module of level one. For $A$ of finite type, we obtain a realization of $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$ as a quotient of the $\hbar$-adic weak quantum vertex algebra ${\mathcal{V}}_A(1)$, giving a characterization of $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$-modules as restricted $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-modules of level one.

High-capillarity limit and smoothing effect of large solutions for a multi-dimensional generic non-conservative compressible two-fluid model
Ling-Yun Shou, Jiayan Wu, Lei Yao, Yinghui Zhang
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We investigate the global existence and long-time behavior of large solutions, in the high-capillarity regime, for a general multidimensional non-conservative compressible two-fluid model with the capillary pressure relation \(f(\alpha^{-}\rho^{-})=P^{+}-P^{-}\). Our main contributions are threefold. First, for sufficiently large capillarity coefficients, we prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions in critical Besov spaces for large initial perturbations, under the sharp stability condition \(-\frac{s_{-}^{2}(1,1)}{\alpha^{-}(1,1)}<f^{\prime}(1)<0\), thereby removing the additional negativity restriction assumed by Evje--Wang--Wen [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 221:1285--1316, 2016]. Second, we give a rigorous justification of the global-in-time convergence to the incompressible Navier-Stokes flows and obtain explicit convergence rates in critical spaces for ill-prepared data. Third, if in addition the initial perturbation lies in a lower-regularity Besov space, we derive optimal decay rates for the solution and for its derivatives of any order, revealing a long-term smoothing effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on global large-amplitude strong solutions for multidimensional compressible two-fluid flows. Our analysis exploits the interplay between dispersion (two-phase Gross--Pitaevskii structure) and parabolic dissipation, both induced by capillarity effects.

Subjects:

We present the first investigation into the transmission of multi-stream information from a base station equipped with reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) to multiple users with the aid of multi-antenna arrays. Building upon this, we propose the joint design of RHS and baseband beamformers that enables multi-stream delivery at fair rates across all users. Specifically, we first introduce a max-min rate optimization approach, which aims for maximizing the minimum rate for all users through iterative solutions of quadratic problems. To reduce complexity, we then propose a surrogate-based optimization approach that offers a low-complexity design alternative relying on closed-form updates. Our simulations show that the surrogate-based approach achieves nearly the same minimum rate as max-min optimization, while delivering sum-rates comparable to those of sum-rate maximization, overcoming the rate-fairness deficiency typical of the latter.

While trivial in the 1-categorical setting, this result becomes interesting for 2-representations: as an application, only relying only on invertibility of Clifford algebras and Fock bimodules in the Morita 2-category of super vector spaces we recover Ludewig--Roos' result that the Clifford/Fock construction is a projective 2-representation of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.

Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
CSP is gaining clinical significance owing to its ability to restore a physiological activation sequence in the ventricles. While His bundle pacing (HBP) producing the most physiological activation is preferable, due to implant complications the selective activation of the LBB by left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is considered an alternative, offering both a simpler implant and a physiological activation sequence. However, the physical mechanisms facilitating selective activation of the LBB remain poorly understood. We developed a structurally and biophysically detailed computer model of the IVS and LBB to quantitatively elucidate the role of lead position, orientation and polarity in achieving optimal s-LBBP thresholds, using a geometrically detailed model of a clinically widely used CSP lead. A deep implant within the LV sub-endocardium ensuring a direct contact between electrode and LBB is key for effective s-LBBP. For low strength s-LBBP is feasible, but capturing the LBB in its entirety could only be achieved using higher strengths that led to non-selective left bundle branch pacing (ns-LBBP). Switching the tip polarity to anodal was not beneficial, requiring higher strengths to activate the LBB. Lead orientation relative to the LBB bundles was found to influence the s-LBBP capture threshold and the number of synchronously activating bundles. The model explains the impedance trends that are clinically observed when advancing the tip through the IVS into the LBB region, as well as sudden impedance drops associated with implant complications such as septal perforation or lead dislodgement. Quantitative consistence with clinically observed trends support model credibility, and indicate that simulation may offer an effective approach for guiding the design of improved CSP leads, facilitating a selective and synchronous activation of the entire LBB.

A New Class of Analog Precoding for Multi-Antenna Multi-User Communications over High-Frequency Bands

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
A network relying on a large antenna-array-aided base station is designed for delivering multiple information streams to multi-antenna users over high-frequency bands such as the millimeter-wave and sub-Terahertz bands. The state-of-the-art analog precoder (AP) dissipates excessive circuit power due to its reliance on a large number of phase shifters. To mitigate the power consumption, we propose a novel AP relying on a controlled number of phase shifters. Within this new AP framework, we design a hybrid precoder (HP) for maximizing the users' minimum throughput, which poses a computationally challenging problem of large-scale, nonsmooth mixed discrete-continuous log-determinant optimization. To tackle this challenge, we develop an algorithm which iterates through solving convex problems to generate a sequence of HPs that converges to the max-min solution. We also introduce a new framework of smooth optimization termed soft max-min throughput optimization. Additionally, we develop another algorithm, which iterates by evaluating closed-form expressions to generate a sequence of HPs that converges to the soft max-min solution. Simulation results reveal that the HP soft max-min solution approaches the Pareto-optimal solution constructed for simultaneously optimizing both the minimum throughput and sum-throughput. Explicitly, it achieves a minimum throughput similar to directly maximizing the users' minimum throughput and it also attains a sum-throughput similar to directly maximizing the sum-throughput.

I establish conditions under which Hamiltonian circles realize all four possible double signs and prove that this occurs when the set of triangle double signs contains at least three distinct values. The proof is based on an analysis of triangle bases of the binary cycle space, structural properties of $K_4$ subgraphs, and explicit Hamiltonian constructions.

A cograph is a simple graph that contains no induced path on four vertices.

where $k \geq 2$, $\alpha_{2k} \geq 2$, and $K_{\alpha_{i}}$ denotes the complete graph on $\alpha_{i}$ vertices. We investigate the spectral properties of the eccentricity matrix of this particular class of cographs. Additionally, we determine the irreducibility and inertia of the eccentricity matrix of $\mathcal{C}$-graphs. Furthermore, we identify an interval $(-1-\sqrt{2},-2)\cup (-2,0)$ in which these graphs have no eccentricity eigenvalues.

Fighting fish is a combinatorial configuration introduced by Duchi et al. as a new model of branching surfaces that generalizes directed convex polyominoes. We come up with an alternative construction of fighting fish, using a tree structure built on the so-called stem cells of fighting fish. From this perspective, we establish a bijection between ternary trees and fighting fish with a marked strip of cells, which specializes to a direct bijection between left ternary trees and fighting fish. Using these results, we obtain a combinatorial enumeration of the fighting fish of size $n$ by establishing a $(n+1)$-to-2 bijection with the ternary trees having $n$ nodes. We present some additional enumerative results including that the fighting fish with a marked tail and the horizontally symmetric fighting fish are equinumerous with the ordered pairs of ternary trees having a total of a prescribed number of nodes.

Title:
Canonical integral operators on the Fock space II
Xingtang Dong, Kehe Zhu
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Complex Variables (math.CV)
In \cite{DZ3} we introduced and studied a two-parameter family of integral operators $T^{(s,t)}$ on the Fock space $F^2$ of the complex plane. Under the inverse Bargmann transform, these operators include the classical {\it linear canonical transforms} in mathematical physics as special cases, so we called $T^{(s,t)}$ {\it canonical linear operators} on the Fock space. In this paper we continue the study of these operators. We show that when a canonical linear operator $T^{(s,t)}$ is compact, it actually belongs to the Schatten class $S_p$ for all $p>0$. In this case, we find all singular values, determine the $S_p$ norm, and obtain a trace formula for $T^{(s,t)}$. We also show that the boundedness (and a natural version of compactness) of $T^{(s,t)}$ on $F^p$ for any given $p\in(0,\infty]$ is equivalent to the boundedness (and compactness) of $T^{(s,t)}$ on $F^2$. Our analysis is based on estimates and computations with the integral kernel of $T^{(s,t)}$, which also yield some interesting results about the Berezin transform and the bivariate Berezin transform of $T^{(s,t)}$.

A Weight Structure on Rigid Analytic Motives over a Field

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)
In this paper, we construct a monoidal weight structure on the stable $\infty$-category of rigid analytic motives over a local field $K$ via Galois descent. This extends the weight structure on the full subcategory of rigid analytic motives with good reduction, which is defined by Binda-Gallauer-Vezzani. As an application, we show that the Hyodo-Kato realization factors through the weight complex functor studied by Bondarko and Sosnilo. In particular, the weight complex yields a spectral sequence converging to the Hyodo-Kato cohomology of smooth quasi-compact $K$-rigid analytic spaces, thereby inducing a weight filtration on it.

Rectifiability of entropy productions for weak solutions of the 2D eikonal equation with supercritical regularity
Xavier Lamy, Elio Marconi
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
Weak solutions $m\colon\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2$ of the eikonal equation \begin{align*} |m|=1\text{ a.e. and }\mathrm{div}\: m =0\,, \end{align*} arise naturally as sharp interface limits of bounded energy configurations in various physically motivated models, including the Aviles-Giga energy. The distributions $\mu_\Phi=\mathrm{div}\,\Phi(m)$, defined for a class of smooth vector fields $\Phi$ called entropies, carry information about singularities and energy cost. If these entropy productions are Radon measures, a long-standing conjecture predicts that they must be concentrated on the 1-rectifiable jump set of $m$, as they do if $m$ has bounded variation (BV) thanks to the chain rule. We establish this concentration property, for a large class of entropies, under the Besov regularity assumption \begin{align*} m\in B^{1/p}_{p,\infty} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \sup_{h\in \mathbb R^2\setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace} \frac{\|m(\cdot +h)-m\|_{L^p }}{|h|^{1/p}} <\infty\,, \end{align*} for any $1\leq p<3$, thus going well beyond the BV setting ($p=1$) and leaving only the borderline case $p=3$ open.

Existence proofs of traveling wave solutions on an infinite strip for the suspension bridge equation and proof of orbital stability
Lindsey van der Aalst, Jan Bouwe van den Berg, Matthieu Cadiot
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.

A central limit theorem for two-dimensional directed polymers with critical spatial correlation
Clément Cosco, Francesca Cottini, Anna Donadini
Comments:
26 pages
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
On the 1+2 dimensional lattice, we consider a directed polymer in a random Gaussian environment that is independent in time and correlated in space. The spatial correlation is supposed to decay as $(\log |x|)^a /|x|^{2}$, $a>-1$, where the square in the polynomial is known to be critical (Lacoin, Ann. Prob. (2011)). We introduce an intermediate regime of temperature $\beta_N \propto \hat \beta/(\log N)^{\frac{a+2}{2}}$, under which the log-partition function $\log W_N^{\beta_N}$ converges in distribution towards a Gaussian random variable if $\hat \beta\in (0,\hat \beta_c)$, whereas $W_N^{\beta_N}$ vanishes for $\hat \beta\geq \hat \beta_c$. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution, which is given by an inverse Bessel function, is determined by an induction scheme whose multi-scale dependence reflects the critical nature of the correlation. The Gaussianity of the limit follows from a decoupling argument of Cosco, Donadini (2024+).

We apply this to obtain spectral sequences computing Picard groups of $\mathrm{K}(n)$-local generalized Moore algebras, and make some preliminary computations including the height $1$ case.

We study the finite basis problem for additively idempotent semirings satisfying the identity $xy \approx xz$. Let $\mathbf{R}$ denote the variety of all such semirings. Yue et al.

In this paper, we show that the subvariety lattice of $\mathbf{R}$ forms a distributive lattice of order $10$. As a consequence, the variety $\mathbf{R}$ is a Cross variety, and every member of $\mathbf{R}$ is finitely based.

Compactness and least energy solutions to the Super-Liouville equation on the Sphere
Mingyang Han, Chunqin Zhou
Subjects:

In this work, we study the super-Liouville equation on the sphere with positive coefficient functions. We begin by deriving estimates for the spinor component of the equation, thereby finding that the energy of the spinor part of solutions is uniformly bounded. We then analyze the compactness of the solution space in two aspects: the compactness for solutions with small energy and the compactness with respect to the conformal transformation group of the sphere. Finally, by introducing a new natural constraint, the Nehari manifold, and employing variational methods, we obtain the existence of the least energy solutions when the coefficient functions are even.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
For computational convenience, a Prony series approximation of the stretched exponential relaxation function of homogeneous glasses has been proposed (J. Mauro, Y. Mauro, 2018), which is the extended Burgers model known for viscoelasticity equations. The authors of [P. Loreti and D. Sforza, 2019] initiated a spectral analysis of glass relaxation along this line, and gave some numerical results on clusters of eigenvalues. A theoretical justification of the results and development of further numerical studies were left open. In this paper, we provide a complete theoretical justification of their results and their numerical verification. Besides these, we solve an inverse spectral problem for clusters of eigenvalues associated with the glass relaxation.

Algorithms for computing classical Gaussian quadrature rules (Gauss-Jacobi, Gauss-Laguerre, and Gauss-Hermite) are presented, based on globally convergent fourth-order iterative methods and asymptotic approximations, which are applied in complementary regions of the parameter space. The combination of these approaches results in methods that surpass previous algorithms in terms of speed, accuracy, and computational range (practically unrestricted). The Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto variants are also considered, along with the computation of the associated barycentric weights. Arbitrary accuracy algorithms are also provided for the symmetric cases (Gauss-Gegenbauer and Gauss-Hermite).

Comparison of Hyodo-Kato and de Rham Fargues-Fontaine Cohomology Theories

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)
We prove that, for adic étale motives over $\mathbb{C}_p$, the vector bundles on the Fargues-Fontaine curve arising from their Hyodo-Kato cohomology coincide with their de Rham-Fargues-Fontaine cohomologies, where the latter provides an overconvergent refinement of crystalline vector bundles, albeit constructed on the generic fiber. This equivalence is established in the setting of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories and respects the full motivic structure. Furthermore, we enrich both realizations with Galois actions, yielding $G_{\breve{\mathbb{Q}}_{p}}$-equivariant solid quasi-coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve; in this equivariant context, the comparison isomorphism becomes canonical. As an application, we show that the de Rham-Fargues-Fontaine cohomology of any smooth quasi-compact rigid analytic variety over $\mathbb{C}_p$ admits a finite slope-increasing filtration.

We study the list chromatic number of the Cartesian product of a complete graph of order $n$ and a complete bipartite graph with partite sets of size $a$ and $b$, denoted $\chi_{\ell}(K_n \square K_{a,b})$. At the 2024 Sparse Graphs Coalition's Workshop on algebraic, extremal, and structural methods and problems in graph colouring, Mudrock presented the following question: For each positive integer $a$, does $\chi_{\ell}(K_n \square K_{a,b}) = n+a$ if and only if $b \geq (n+a-1)!^a/(a-1)!^a$? In this paper, we show the answer to this question is yes by studying $\chi_{\ell}(H \square K_{a,b})$ when $H$ is strongly chromatic-choosable (a special form of vertex criticality) with the help of the list color function and analytic inequalities such as that of Karamata. Our result can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known result that $\chi_{\ell}(K_{a,b}) = 1+a$ if and only if $b \geq a^a$.

A Function-Sharing Criterion for Normal Functions

In this paper, we present a function-sharing criterion for the normality of meromorphic functions. Let $f$ be a meromorphic function in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}\subset \mathbb{C}$, $\psi_1$, $\psi_2$, and $\psi_3$ be three meromorphic functions in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, continuous on $ \partial{\mathbb{D}}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,:\,|z|=1\}$, such that $\psi_i(z)\neq\psi_j(z)$ $(1\leq i<j\leq 3)$ $\partial\mathbb{D}$. We prove that, if $\psi_1$, $\psi_2$, and $\psi_3$ share the function $f$ on $\mathbb{D}$, then $f$ is normal. Building upon this, we further establish an additional criterion for normal functions.

We investigate the well-posedness of Hasegawa-Mima equation (HME) in bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary condition and singular density under different regularity assumptions on the data. Our approach relies on the coupling of a fourth-order regularization of the HME, the spectral Galerkin method and an appropriate regularization of the singular density. Uniqueness holds in the class of solutions with very mild singularities à la Yudovich or with bounded densities.

We use these inequalities to bring counter-examples to the product formula for $d\cat$ and $\dTC$.

Frieze patterns in representation theory
Eleonore Faber

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Friezes are infinite arrays of numbers, in which every four neighbouring vertices arranged in a diamond satisfy the same arithmetic rule. Introduced in the late 1960s by Coxeter, and further studied by Conway and Coxeter in their remarkable papers from 1973, this topic has been nearly forgotten for over thirty years. But since the discovery of connections to cluster algebras and categories of type $A$, interest in friezes has exploded, several generalizations have been studied, and links to geometry and combinatorics have been explored.
In this article we will review some of the most striking results connecting the purely combinatorially defined friezes with triangulations of polygons, Grassmannian cluster algebras and (Grassmannian) cluster categories. Then we will focus on Grassmannian cluster categories and some recent results linking them to friezes.

In this paper, we use inductive methods similar to those employed in a 2025 paper by Alberts, Lemke Oliver, Wang and Wood in order to prove many new cases of the Twisted Malle's Conjecture. Previously, this conjecture had only been proven for $T \trianglelefteq G$ where $T$ is abelian, and for $S_3^m \trianglelefteq S_3 \wr B$. We prove many new examples of this conjecture, such as for $A \wr M \trianglelefteq A \wr B$ where $A$ is a finite abelian $p$-group, $B$ is a $p$-group, and $M$ is a proper abelian normal subgroup of $B$, and for $C_p \wr M \trianglelefteq C_p \wr B$, where $|B|$ is odd and $M$ is a proper abelian normal subgroup of $B$.

Spectral Analysis of the Weighted Frobenius Objective
Vladislav Trifonov, Ivan Oseledets, Ekaterina Muravleva
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
We analyze a weighted Frobenius loss for approximating symmetric positive definite matrices in the context of preconditioning iterative solvers. Unlike the standard Frobenius norm, the weighted loss penalizes error components associated with small eigenvalues of the system matrix more strongly. Our analysis reveals that each eigenmode is scaled by the corresponding square of its eigenvalue, and that, under a fixed error budget, the loss is minimized only when the error is confined to the direction of the largest eigenvalue. This provides a rigorous explanation of why minimizing the weighted loss naturally suppresses low-frequency components, which can be a desirable strategy for the conjugate gradient method. The analysis is independent of the specific approximation scheme or sparsity pattern, and applies equally to incomplete factorizations, algebraic updates, and learning-based constructions. Numerical experiments confirm the predictions of the theory, including an illustration where sparse factors are trained by a direct gradient updates to IC(0) factor entries, i.e., no trained neural network model is used.

Line-width and path-width
Tung Nguyen, Alex Scott, Paul Seymour
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For finite graphs, path-width is an interesting and useful concept, but if we extend it to infinite graphs in the most obvious way (by making the indexing path infinite), it does not work nicely. The simplest extension that works nicely is to allow the indexing set to be any totally-ordered set, and then the corresponding decomposition is called a ``line-decomposition'', and the maximum bag size needed is called ``line-width''.
In particular, the indexing set need not be a well-order; but the corresponding decomposition would be easier to use if it was. We show that if a graph has line-width at most $k$, it admits a well-ordered line-decomposition with width at most $2k$, and this is best possible.

The slender body free boundary problem
Laurel Ohm
Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the slender body free boundary problem describing the evolution of an inextensible, closed elastic filament immersed in a Stokes fluid in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The filament elasticity is governed by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and the coupling between this 1D elasticity law and the surrounding 3D fluid is governed by the slender body Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) map, which treats the filament as a 3D object with constant cross-sectional radius $0<\epsilon\ll1$. This map serves as a mathematical justification for slender body theories wherein such 3D-1D couplings play a central role. We develop a solution theory for the filament evolution under this coupling. Our analysis relies on two main ingredients: (1) an extraction of the principal symbol of the slender body NtD map, from the author's previous work, and (2) a detailed treatment of the tension determination problem for enforcing the inextensibility constraint. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for various computational models in which a slender filament evolves according to a 1D elasticity law in a 3D fluid. This forms a key development in our broader program to place slender body theories on firm theoretical footing.

Randomized Space-Time Sampling for Affine Graph Dynamical Systems
Le Gong, Longxiu Huang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
This paper investigates the problem of dynamical sampling for graph signals influenced by a constant source term. We consider signals evolving over time according to a linear dynamical system on a graph, where both the initial state and the source term are bandlimited. We introduce two random space-time sampling regimes and analyze the conditions under which stable recovery is achievable. While our framework extends recent work on homogeneous dynamics, it addresses a fundamentally different setting where the evolution includes a constant source term. This results in a non-orthogonal-diagonalizable system matrix, rendering classical spectral techniques inapplicable and introducing new challenges in sampling design, stability analysis, and joint recovery of both the initial state and the forcing term. A key component of our analysis is the spectral graph weighted coherence, which characterizes the interplay between the sampling distribution and the graph structure. We establish sampling complexity bounds ensuring stable recovery via the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and develop a robust recovery algorithm with provable error guarantees. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abrupt decorrelation for linear stochastic differential equations

Understanding how a system loses memory of its initial state is a central problem in probability and statistics. In this manuscript, we introduce the notion of abrupt decorrelation, which explicitly characterises a sharp and sudden loss of correlation over time. We study this phenomenon within a class of linear stochastic differential equations (LSDEs), where explicit descriptions are available under various statistical distances. Our main focus is on the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while in the one-dimensional case we extend the analysis to LSDEs with time-dependent drifts. The results highlight strong parallels with the cut-off phenomenon in Markov processes and contribute to a broader understanding of decorrelation in stochastic systems.

Representation of solutions to continuous and discrete first-order linear matrix equations with pure delay involving nonpermutable matrices
Javad A. Asadzade, Nazim I. Mahmudov
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper presents a unified treatment of first-order linear matrix equations (FLMEs) with pure delay in both continuous and discrete time, under the general setting of noncommutative coefficient matrices. In the continuous-time framework, we consider delayed matrix differential equations of the form
\[
\dot{X}(\vartheta) = A_0 X(\vartheta-\sigma) + X(\vartheta-\sigma) A_1 + G(\vartheta), \quad \vartheta \geq 0,
\]
where \(A_0, A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) satisfy \(A_0 A_1 \neq A_1 A_0\), \(G(\vartheta)\) is a prescribed matrix function, and \(\sigma >0\) denotes the delay. We derive explicit representations of the solution for initial data \(X(\vartheta) = \Psi(\vartheta)\), \(\vartheta \in [-\sigma,0]\), highlighting the structural impact of noncommutativity.
For the discrete-time analogue, the system
\[
\Delta X(u) = A_0 X(u-m) + X(u-m) A_1 + G(u)
\]
is analyzed using recursively defined auxiliary matrices \(Q_u\) and a fundamental matrix function \(Z(u)\), yielding closed-form solutions for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases. These results extend classical representations for commutative systems to the noncommutative setting. Collectively, continuous and discrete analyzes provide a comprehensive framework for understanding delayed linear matrix dynamics, with potential applications in control theory, signal processing, and iterative learning.

We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sjöstrand.
We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.

Given $r\in \mathbb{N}$ with $r\geq 4$, we show that there exists $n_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $n\geq n_0$, every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (\frac{1}{2}+o(1))n$ and $\alpha_{r-2}(G)=o(n)$ contains a $K_{r}$-factor. This resolves the first open case of a question proposed by Nenadov and Pehova, and reiterated by Knierm and Su. We further introduce two lower bound constructions that, along with some known results, fully resolve a question presented by Balogh, Molla, and Sharifzadeh.

Title:
On some log-concavity properties of the Alexander-Conway and Links-Gould invariants

The Links--Gould invariant $\mathrm{LG}(L ; t_0, t_1)$ of a link $L$ is a two-variable quantum generalization of the Alexander--Conway polynomial $\Delta_L(t)$ and has been shown to share some of its most geometric features in several recent works. Here we suggest that $\mathrm{LG}$ likely shares another of the Alexander polynomial's most distinctive - and mysterious - properties: for alternating links, the coefficients of the Links-Gould polynomial alternate and appear to form a log-concave two-indexed sequence with no internal zeros. The former was observed by Ishii for knots with up to 10 crossings. We further conjecture that they satisfy a bidimensional property of unimodality, thereby replicating a long-standing conjecture of Fox (1962) regarding the Alexander polynomial, and a subsequent refinement by Stoimenow. We also point out that the Stoimenow conjecture reflects a more structural phenomenon: after a suitable normalization, the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link appears to be a Lorentzian polynomial. We give compelling experimental and computational evidence for these different properties.

Combinatorial proofs of Petrie Pieri rule and Plethystic Pieri rule

Combinatorics (math.CO)
Petrie symmetric functions $G(k,n)$, also known as truncated homogeneous symmetric functions or modular complete symmetric functions, form a class of symmetric functions interpolating between the elementary symmetric functions $e_n$ and the homogeneous symmetric functions $h_n$. Analogous to the Pieri rule for $s_\mu h_n$ and the dual Pieri rule for $s_\mu e_n$, Grinberg showed that the Schur coefficients for the ``Pieri rule'' of $s_\mu G(k,n)$ can be determined by the determinant $\pet_k(\lambda,\mu)$ of Petrie matrices. Cheng, Chou, Eu, Fu, and Yao provided a ribbon tiling interpretation for the coefficient $\pet_k(\lambda,\varnothing)$, which was later generalized by Jin, Jing, and Liu to $\pet_k(\lambda,\mu)$ in the case where $\lambda/\mu$ is connected.
The goal of this paper is to offer a more transparent combinatorial perspective on the structure and behavior of Petrie symmetric functions. First, we provide a refined combinatorial formula for the determinant of a Petrie matrix in terms of certain orientations of the associated graph derived from the matrix. We then generalize the result of JJL to arbitrary skew shapes using purely combinatorial proofs. In addition, we investigate the generating function of these orientations with respect to certain statistics. As an application of our method, we present a combinatorial proof of the plethystic Pieri rule.

Counting $2\times 2$ matrices with fixed determinant and bounded coefficients
Kavita Dhanda, Alan Haynes, Silmi Prasala
Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Recent work by M. Afifurrahman established the first asymptotic estimates with error terms for the number of $2\times 2$ matrices with fixed non-zero determinant $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and with coefficients bounded in absolute value by $X$. In this paper we present a new proof of this result, which also gives an improved error term as $X\rightarrow\infty$. Similar to Afifurrahman's result, our error term is uniform in both $n$ and $X$, and our estimates are significant for $X$ as small as $n^{1/2+\delta}$. To complement this, we also demonstrate that the exponent $1/2+\delta$ in this statement cannot be reduced, by establishing a result which gives a different asymptotic main term when $n$ is either a prime or the square of a prime, and when $X=n^{1/2}$.

An Improved Yau-Yau Algorithm for High Dimensional Nonlinear Filtering Problems
Shing-Tung Yau, Yi-Shuai Niu
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Nonlinear state estimation under noisy observations is rapidly intractable as system dimension increases. We introduce an improved Yau-Yau filtering framework that breaks the curse of dimensionality and extends real-time nonlinear filtering to systems with up to thousands of state dimensions, achieving high-accuracy estimates in just a few seconds with rigorous theoretical error guarantees. This new approach integrates quasi-Monte Carlo low-discrepancy sampling, a novel offline-online update, high-order multi-scale kernel approximations, fully log-domain likelihood computation, and a local resampling-restart mechanism, all realized with CPU/GPU-parallel computation. Theoretical analysis guarantees local truncation error \(O(\Delta t^2 + D^*(n))\) and global error \(O(\Delta t + D^*(n)/\Delta t)\), where \(\Delta t\) is the time step and \(D^*(n)\) the star-discrepancy. Numerical experiments, spanning large-scale nonlinear cubic sensors up to 1000 dimensions, highly nonlinear small-scale problems, and linear Gaussian benchmarks, demonstrate sub-quadratic runtime scaling, sub-linear error growth, and excellent performance that surpasses the extended and unscented Kalman filters (EKF, UKF) and the particle filter (PF) under strong nonlinearity, while matching or exceeding the optimal Kalman-Bucy filter in linear regimes. By breaking the curse of dimensionality, our method enables accurate, real-time, high-dimensional nonlinear filtering, opening broad opportunities for applications in science and engineering.

A nonlinear homogenization-based perspective on the soft modes and effective energies of some conformal metamaterials

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
There is a growing mechanics literature concerning the macroscopic properties of mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. This amounts mathematically to a homogenization problem involving nonlinear elasticity. A key goal is to identify the "soft modes" of the metamaterial. We achieve this goal using methods from homogenization for some specific 2D examples -- including discrete models of the Rotating Squares metamaterial and the Kagome metamaterial -- whose soft modes are compressive conformal maps. The innovation behind this achievement is a new technique for bounding the effective energy from below, which takes advantage of the metamaterial's structure and symmetry.

Further results on bent partitions
Jiaxin Wang, Yadi Wei, Fang-Wei Fu
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Bent partitions of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ play an important role in constructing (vectorial) bent functions, partial difference sets, and association schemes, where $V_{n}^{(p)}$ denotes an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, $n$ is an even positive integer, and $p$ is a prime. For bent partitions, there remains a challenging open problem: Whether the depth of any bent partition of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ is always a power of $p$. Notably, the depths of all current known bent partitions of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ are powers of $p$. In this paper, we prove that for a bent partition $\Gamma$ of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ for which all the $p$-ary bent functions generated by $\Gamma$ are regular or all are weakly regular but not regular, the depth of $\Gamma$ must be a power of $p$. We present new constructions of bent partitions that (do not) correspond to vectorial dual-bent functions. In particular, a new construction of vectorial dual-bent functions is provided. Additionally, for general bent partitions of $V_{n}^{(2)}$, we establish a characterization in terms of Hadamard matrices.

Comments:

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
In this paper, we study differentially private mechanisms for functions whose outputs lie in a Euclidean Jordan algebra. Euclidean Jordan algebras capture many important mathematical structures and form the foundation of linear programming, second-order cone programming, and semidefinite programming. Our main contribution is a generic Gaussian mechanism for such functions, with sensitivity measured in $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_\infty$ norms. Notably, this framework includes the important case where the function outputs are symmetric matrices, and sensitivity is measured in the Frobenius, nuclear, or spectral norm. We further derive private algorithms for solving symmetric cone programs under various settings, using a combination of the multiplicative weights update method and our generic Gaussian mechanism. As an application, we present differentially private algorithms for semidefinite programming, resolving a major open question posed by [Hsu, Roth, Roughgarden, and Ullman, ICALP 2014].

Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
One considers quasihomogeneous isolated singularities of hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions through the lenses of three apparently quite apart themes: syzygies, singularity invariants, and foliations. In the first of these, one adds to the well-known result of Saito's a syzygy-theoretic characterization of a quasihomogeneous singularity affording an effective computational criterion. In the second theme, one explores the Milnor-Tjurina difference number from a commutative algebra viewpoint. Building on the Briancon-Skoda theorem and exponent, we extend previously known inequalities by Dimca and Greuel to arbitrary dimension and provide algebraic formulas involving the syzygy-theoretic part and reduction exponents. In the last theme one recovers and bring up to an algebraic light a result of Camacho and Movasati by establishing a couple of characterizations of quasihomogeneous isolated singularities in terms of the generators of the module of invariant vector fields.

A decoupled and structure-preserving direct discontinuous Galerkin method for the Keller-Segel Model

Comments:
23 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this work, we develop a novel numerical scheme to solve the classical Keller--Segel (KS) model which simultaneously preserves its intrinsic mathematical structure and achieves optimal accuracy. The model is reformulated into a gradient flow structure using the energy variational method, which reveals the inherent energy dissipative dynamics of the system. Based on this reformulation, we construct a structure-preserving discretization by semi-implicit method in time and the direct discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) method in space, resulting in a stable and high-order accurate approximation. The proposed scheme enjoys several desirable properties: (i) energy stability, ensuring discrete free energy dissipation; (ii) exact conservation of mass for the cell density; (iii) positivity preservation of the numerical cell density, enforced via a carefully designed limiter; and (iv) optimal convergence rate, with first-order accuracy in time and $(k+1)$-th order accuracy in space for polynomials of degree $k$. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis that substantiate these properties. In addition, extensive numerical experiments, including benchmark problems exhibiting pattern formation and near blow-up behavior, are conducted to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method. The approach offers a flexible and reliable framework for structure-preserving numerical simulation of chemotaxis models and other gradient flow-type systems.

This paper aims to investigate the self-similarity property in finitely-generated torsion-free nilpotent groups. We establish connections between geometric equivalence and self-similarity in these groups. Moreover, we show that any 2-generated torsion-free nilpotent group of class 3 has a faithful representation as a transitive self-similar group. Additionally, we provide an example of a 4-generated torsion-free nilpotent group of class 3 that does not admit such a representation. This example, sourced from the work of V. Bludov and B. Gusev in \cite{BG}, resolves a question posed by S. Sidki in \cite{LectureDusseldorf}.

We consider the numerical reconstruction of the spatially dependent conductivity coefficient and the source term in elliptic partial differential equations of in a two-dimensional convex polygonal domain, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and given interior observation of the solution. Using data assimilation, some approximated gradients of our error functional are derived to update the reconstructed coefficients, and new $L^2$ error estimates for such minimization formulations are given for the spatially discretized reconstructions. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the method and demonstrate the error estimates. The numerical results also show that the reconstruction is very robust for the error in certain inputted coefficients.

Neural Network Dual Norms for Minimal Residual Finite Element Methods
Hamd Alsobhi, Emin Benny-Chacko, Ignacio Brevis, Kristoffer G. van der Zee
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Minimal-residual methods for PDEs with a residual in a dual space are non-trivial to guarantee stability. We present a minimal-residual finite element method in which the solution space is a standard finite element space, but neural networks are used as test functions for the evaluation of residual dual norms. The use of a neural network improves the approximation of the residual representer, and thereby improves the stability of the method. Our hybrid approach is implemented through a deep residual Uzawa algorithm that alternates finite element updates with neural network training. We prove consistency and convergence results for the Uzawa methodology. We also prove an a priori error estimate that relies on a suitable Fortin compatibility condition. Numerical experiments on advection-reaction problems with singular or discontinuous data show that the proposed framework delivers robust and accurate approximations.

Also, we find that normal-$m$-isometry and normal quasi-$m$-isometry weighted composition operators have finite spectrum. Consequently we have the results for composition and multiplication operators. In addition, we prove that for $m\geq 2$, a multiplication operator is $m$-isometry (quasi-$m$-isometry) if and only if it is $2$-isometry (quasi-$2$-isometry). Some examples are provided to illustrate our results.

Hessian-guided Perturbed Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Escaping Saddle Points

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF) is a common method to perform optimization over the space of probability measures. While WGF is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point, for nonconvex functionals the converged solution does not necessarily satisfy the second-order optimality condition; i.e., it could converge to a saddle point. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for probability measure optimization, perturbed Wasserstein gradient flow (PWGF), that achieves second-order optimality for general nonconvex objectives. PWGF enhances WGF by injecting noisy perturbations near saddle points via a Gaussian process-based scheme. By pushing the measure forward along a random vector field generated from a Gaussian process, PWGF helps the solution escape saddle points efficiently by perturbing the solution towards the smallest eigenvalue direction of the Wasserstein Hessian. We theoretically derive the computational complexity for PWGF to achieve a second-order stationary point. Furthermore, we prove that PWGF converges to a global optimum in polynomial time for strictly benign objectives.

Small solutions of ternary quadratic congruences with averaging over the moduli

In a recent paper, we proved that for any large enough odd modulus $q\in \mathbb{N}$ and fixed $\alpha_2\in \mathbb{N}$ coprime to $q$, the congruence \[ x_1^2+\alpha_2x_2^2+\alpha_3x_3^2\equiv 0 \bmod{q} \] has a solution of $(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \mathbb{Z}^3$ with $x_3$ coprime to $q$ of height $\max\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\}\le q^{11/24+\varepsilon}$ for, in a sense, almost all $\alpha_3$, where $\alpha_3$ runs over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$. Here it was of significance that $11/24<1/2$, so we broke a natural barrier. In this paper, we average the moduli $q$ in addition, establishing the existence of a solution of height $\le Q^{3/8+\varepsilon}\alpha_2^{\varepsilon}$ for almost all pairs $(q,\alpha_3)$, with $Q$ large enough, $Q<q\le 2Q$, $q$ coprime to $2\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ running over the reduced residue classes modulo $q$.

Ledrappier-Young entropy formula for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting Part 1: Unstable entropy formula and invariance principle
Shaobo Gan, Yao Tong, Jiagang Yang
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We study the unstable entropy of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splittings. Our main result shows that when the zero Lyapunov exponent has multiplicity one, the center direction contributes no entropy, and the unstable entropy coincides with the metric entropy. This extends the celebrated work of Ledrappier-Young [18] for $C^2$ diffeomorphisms to the $C^1$ setting under these assumptions. In particular, our results apply to $C^1$ diffeomorphisms away from homoclinic tangencies due to [20].
As consequences, we obtain several applications at $C^1$ regularity. The Avila-Viana invariance principle [7, 33] holds when the center is one-dimensional. Results on measures of maximal entropy due to Hertz-Hertz-Tahzibi-Ures [25], Tahzibi-Yang [33]}, and Ures-Viana-Yang-Yang [34, 35] also remain valid for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms.

We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.

Communication over LQG Control Systems: A Convex Optimization Approach to Capacity
Aharon Rips, Oron Sabag
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study communication over control systems, where a controller-encoder selects inputs to a dynamical system in order to simultaneously regulate the system and convey a message to an observer that has access to the system's output measurements. This setup reflects implicit communication, as the controller embeds a message in the control signal. The capacity of a control system is the maximal reliable rate of the embedded message subject to a closed-loop control-cost constraint. We focus on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control systems, in which the dynamical system is given by a state-space model with Gaussian noise, and the control cost is a quadratic function of the system inputs and system states. Our main result is a convex optimization upper bound on the capacity of LQG systems. In the case of scalar systems, we prove that the upper bound yields the exact LQG system capacity. The upper bound also recovers all known results, including LQG control, feedback capacity of Gaussian channels with memory, and the LQG system capacity with a state-feedback. For vector LQG control systems, we provide a sufficient condition for tightness of the upper bound, based on the Riccati equation. Numerical simulations indicate the upper bound tightness in all tested examples, suggesting that the upper bound may be equal to the LQG system capacity in the vector case as well.

We consider the Cauchy problem to the 3D barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equation. We prove global well-posedness, assuming that the initial data $(\rho_0-1,u_0)$ has small norms in the critical Besov space $\mathbb{X}_p=\dot{B}_{p,1}^{3/p}(\mathbb{R}^3)\times \dot{B}_{p,1}^{-1+3/p}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for $2\leq p<6$ and $(\rho_0-1,\rho_0u_0)$ satisfies an additional low frequency condition. Our results extend the previous results in \cite{FD2010, CMZ2010, H20112} where $p<4$ is needed for high frequency, to the optimal range $p<6$. The main ingredients of the proof consist of: a novel nonlinear transform that uses momentum formulation for low-frequency and effective velocity method for high frequency, and estimate of parabolic-dispersive semigroup that enables a $L^q$-framework for low frequency.

We study properties of the restriction of discrete series representations of $G=U(p,q)$ to $G'= U(p-1,q)$ and the corresponding symmetry breaking operators in $\operatorname{Hom}_{G'}(\pi|_{G'}, \pi')$. This leads to the introduction of elementary and coherent pairs of discrete series representations and their classification. Translations of symmetry breaking operators are defined via tensor products with finite-dimensional representations, which leads to the study of the coherent cohomology of discrete series representations under restriction and translations. This is applied to the study of cup products of coherent cohomology of associated Shimura varieties, and to the arithmetic of central values of certain Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions of $GL(n+1)\times GL(n)$.

Guardian maps are scalar maps that vanish when a matrix or polynomial is on the verge of stability. Several guardian maps have been proposed in the literature for Hurwitz stability based on the Kronecker sum, the second lower Schläflian matrix, and the bialternate sum. It is natural to ask if there is a unifying principle for all these
maps. Here, we introduce the Lie-algebraic notion of a guardian representation, and show that all the examples above are instances of this unifying idea. We also show that the bialternate sum coincides with the second additive compound.

Multiscale solution decomposition of nonlocal-in-time problems with application in numerical computation

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This work develops a multiscale solution decomposition (MSD) method for nonlocal-in-time problems to separate a series of known terms with multiscale singularity from the original singular solution such that the remaining unknown part becomes smoother. We demonstrate that the MSD provides a scenario where the smoothness assumption for solutions of weakly singular nonlocal-in-time problems, a commonly encountered assumption in numerous literature of numerical methods that is in general not true for original solutions, becomes appropriate such that abundant numerical analysis results therein become applicable. From computational aspect, instead of handling solution singularity, the MSD significantly reduces the numerical difficulties by separating and thus circumventing the solution singularity. We consider typical problems, including the fractional relaxation equation, Volterra integral equation, subdiffusion, integrodifferential equation and diffusion-wave equation, to demonstrate the universality of MSD and its effectiveness in improving the numerical accuracy or stability in comparison with classical methods.

In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.

In this paper, we establish a sharp Onofri trace inequality on the upper half space $\overline{\mathbb R_+^n} (n\geq 2)$ by considering the limiting case of Sobolev trace inequality and classify its extremal functions on a suitable weighted Sobolev space. For this aim, by the Serrin-Zou type identity and the Pohozaev type identity, we show the classification of the solutions for a quasi-linear Liouville equation with Neumann boundary which is closely related to the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Onofri trace inequality and it has independent research value. The regularity and asymptotic estimates of solutions to the above equation are essential to discuss.

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $G_S$ be a graph with loops attached at each vertex in $S \subseteq V(G).$ In this article, we develop exact formulae for the number of closed $3$- and $4$-walks on $G_S$ in terms of vertex degrees and certain elementary subgraphs of $G_S.$ We then derive the specific closed walks formulae for several graph families such as complete bipartite self-loop graphs, complete graphs, cycle graphs, etc. We demonstrate that such invariants are non-trivial in $G_S,$ which otherwise may be trivial in the loopless case. Moreover, we study a moment-like quantity $\mathcal{M}_q(G_S)=\sum^n_{i=1} |\lambda_i(G_S) - \frac{\sigma}{n}|^q,$ twisted by the spectral moment $\mathsf{M}_1(G_S)$ for $G_S,$ and show a positivity result. We also establish that the following ratio inequality holds: \[ \frac{\mathcal{M}_{1}}{\mathcal{M}_{0}} \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{2}}{\mathcal{M}_{1}} \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{3}}{\mathcal{M}_{2}} \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{4}}{\mathcal{M}_{3}} \leq \cdots \leq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{n}}{\mathcal{M}_{n-1}} \leq \cdots. \] As a consequence, we obtain lower bounds for the self-loop graph energy $\mathcal{E}(G_S)$ in terms of $\mathcal{M}_i,$ extending some classical bounds.

On saturation problems for matchings with regularity constraints

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A graph $G$ is $F$-saturated if $G$ is $F$-free but for any edge $e$ in the complement of $G$ the graph $G + e$ contains $F$. Gerbner et al. (Discrete Math., 345 (2022), 112921) initiated the study of $rsat(n,F)$, the minimum number of edges in a regular $n$-vertex $F$-saturated graph, and they posed the problem of for which graphs $rsat(n, F )$ exists. Regarding this problem, we obtain the precise value of $rsat(n,(m+1)K_2)$ for all possible cases, where $(m+1)K_2$ denotes a matching of size $m+1$. As a natural counterpart, we also determine the maximum number of edges in a regular $n$-vertex $(m+1)K_2$-free graph for all $m\ge 1$ and $n\ge 2m+2$.

In this paper, we construct a Feller-Dynkin boundary process by applying the method of intertwiners to the coherent family, introduced in our previous work, of Laguerre processes with a fixed parameter. The corresponding boundary process is computed explicitly, and it turns out to be a deterministic dynamical system. Since the Pickrell diffusions that leave the Pickrell measure invariant are coherent with respect to the same projective system, we also obtain the stochastic boundary process associated with the coherent family of Pickrell diffusions.

Localized and weighted versions of extremal problems

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Malec and Tompkins (EUJC, 2023) considered the localized versions of Turán-type problems, and proved a localized theorem on Erdős-Gallai Theorem on paths. Zhao and Zhang (JGT, 2025) gave a long proof of a localized version of Erdős-Gallai Theorem on cycles.
In this paper, we consider several types of generalization of Turán-type problems, that is, localized versions, weighted versions, and generalized Turán-type problems, and their connectedness. We first present very short proofs for recent results of Malec-Tompkins and Zhao-Zhang, respectively. We use Small Path Double Cover Conjecture, which was proposed by Bondy (JGT, 1990) and confirmed by Hao Li (JGT, 1990), to prove a weighted localized Turán-type theorem on paths. We prove localized versions of Balister-Bollobás-Riordan-Schelp Theorem (JCTB, 2003) on paths and Erdős-Gallai Theorem on matchings, respectively. We show that our first localized result implies Balister-Bollobás- Riordan-Schelp Theorem, Erdős-Gallai Theorem, and Malec-Tompkins Theorem on paths. Finally, we present generalized Turán-style generalizations of the Malec-Tompkin's Theorem, and discuss the relationship between some previous theorems in different motivations.

A bijection between symmetric plane partitions and quasi transpose complementary plane partitions

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We resolve the explicit bijection problem between symmetric plane partitions (SPPs) and quasi transpose complementary plane partitions (QTCPPs), introduced by Schreier-Aigner, who proved their equinumerosity. First, we relate this problem to Proctor's parallel equinumerosities for SPPs, even SPPs, staircase plane partitions, and parity staircase plane partitions, by constructing several bijections, one of which is based on the jeu de taquin algorithm. As a result, we reduce the task to constructing a compatible bijection between even SPPs and staircase plane partitions. We then provide non-intersecting lattice path configurations for these objects, apply the LGV lemma, and transform the resulting path configuration. This process leads us to new combinatorial objects, $I_m$ and $J_m$, and the task is further reduced to constructing a compatible sijection (signed bijection) between $I_m$ and $J_m$, which is carried out in the final part of this paper. Our construction also answers the 35-year-old open problem posed by Proctor: constructing an explicit bijection between even SPPs and staircase plane partitions.

Computational results on semistrong edge coloring of graphs
Yuquan Lin, Wensong Lin
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The semistrong edge coloring, as a relaxation of the well-known strong edge coloring, can be used to model efficient communication scheduling in wireless networks. An edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called \emph{semistrong} if every color class $M$ is a matching such that every edge of $M$ is incident with a vertex of degree 1 in the subgraph of $G$ induced by the endvertices of edges in $M$. The \emph{semistrong chromatic index} $\chi_{ss}'(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum number of colors required for a semistrong edge coloring. In this paper, we prove that the problem of determining whether a graph $G$ has a semistrong edge coloring with $k$ colors is polynomial-time solvable for $k\le2$ and is NP-complete for $k\ge3$. For trees, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the semistrong chromatic index exactly.

interacting with an incompressible liquid through transport and buoyancy, where the suitably smooth function $\phi$ satisfies $\phi>0$ on $(0,\infty)$ with $\phi(0)=0$ and $\phi'(0)>0$, and the parameter $\mu\geq 0$. For all reasonably regular initial data, if $\mu=0$, the corresponding initial boundary value problem possesses global classical solutions with a smallness condition on $\int_\Omega n_0$; whereas if $\mu>0$, this problem possesses global bounded classical solutions, which can converge toward (1,0,0) as time tends to infinity when a certain small mass is imposed on the initial data $v_0$. These results extend recent results for the fluid-free system to one in a Navier-Stokes fluid environment.

Reachability-based Approach to Point-to-Point Steering Problem

Submitted to Automatica
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
This paper presents a reachability-based approach to finite-time transition problem of nonlinear systems between two stationary points (i.e., the point-to-point steering problem). When the target state is reachable, we prove that a solution can always be constructed by concatenation of two Pontraygin extremals. This allows to formulate the problem as a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) of extremals, where the solution existence to the formulated TPBVP is equivalent to that of the original problem. The theoretical developments are applied to curves with prescribed curvature bounds in R3, thereby extending the recent works on Dubins car to dimension three. We prove that to construct a curvature-bounded path in R3 with prescribed length and boundary conditions, it suffices to consider the trajectories that are concatenations of CSC, CCC, their subsegments, and H, where C denotes a circular arc with maximum curvature, S a straight line segment, and H a certain class of helicoidal arcs with constant curvature. Numerical demonstrations are conducted on a nonlinear dynamics example, and on curvature-bounded paths in R2 and R3.

In this work, we describe how to construct matrices and block right-hand sides the exhibit a specified restarted block GMRES convergence pattern, such that the eigenvalues and Ritz values at each iteration can be chosen independent of the specified convergence behavior. This work is a generalization of the work in [Meurant and Tebbens, Num. Alg. 2019] in which the authors do the same for restarted non-block GMRES. We use the same tools as were used in [Kubínová and Soodhalter, SIMAX 2020], namely to analyze block GMRES as an iteration over a right vector space with scalars from the $^\ast$-algebra of matrices. To facilitate our work, we also extend the work of Meurant and Tebbens and offer alternative proofs of some of their results, that can be more easily generalized to the block setting.

Let $R$ be an associative unital algebra over a commutative unital ring $\Phi$. Consider the algebra $T_n(R)$ of triangular $n \times n$ matrices over $R$, and its subalgebra $T_n^0(R)$ consisting of matrices whose main diagonal entries lie in $\Phi$. We prove that for any Jordan homomorphism of $T_n(R)$, its restriction to $T_n^0(R)$ is standard.

Proving the existence of localized patterns and saddle node bifurcations in 1D activator-inhibitor type models
Dominic Blanco, Matthieu Cadiot, Daniel Fassler
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we present a general framework for constructively proving the existence and stability of stationary localized 1D solutions and saddle-node bifurcations in activator--inhibitor systems using computer-assisted proofs. Specifically, we develop the necessary analysis to compute explicit upper bounds required in a Newton--Kantorovich approach. Given an approximate solution $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, this approach relies on establishing that a well-chosen fixed point map is contracting on a neighborhood $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. For this matter, we construct an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, and establish sufficient conditions under which the contraction is achieved. This provides a framework for which computer-assisted analysis can be applied to verify the existence and local uniqueness of solutions in a vicinity of $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$, and control the linearization around $\bar{\mathbf{u}}$. Furthermore, we extend the method to rigorously establish saddle-node bifurcations of localized solutions for the same type of models, by considering a well--chosen zero--finding problem. This depends on the rigorous control of the spectrum of the linearization around the bifurcation point. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by proving the existence and stability of multiple steady-state patterns in various activator--inhibitor systems, as well as a saddle--node bifurcation in the Glycolysis model.

The invariant measure of nonlinear McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with common noise

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper focuses on the invariant measure of McKean-Vlasov (MV) stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with common noise (wCN) whose coefficients depend on both the state and the measure. Using the existence of the unique solution of the corresponding stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), we give the strong/weak existence and uniqueness of the couple of the solution and its conditional distribution of the MV-SDEwCN. Then we construct a complete product measure space under given distance and an operator acting on the measure couple of the solution. By the help of the semigroup property of the operators, we establish the existence of the unique invariant measure for the solution couple of the MV-SDEwCN, whose coefficients grow polynomially. Then we establish the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos and give the convergence rate of the measure couple of one single particle and the empirical measure of the interacting particle system to the underlying invariant measure. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate our main results.

We generalize and sharpen this result at the same time, by showing that every Nash-smooth hyperbolicity cone is even second-order cone representable (socr). The result is proved as a consequence of another theorem, according to which every compact convex semialgebraic set is socr, provided that its boundary is Nash-smooth of strict positive curvature. The proof uses the technique of tensor evaluation.

Hamiltonian dynamics describe a wide range of physical systems. As such, data-driven simulations of Hamiltonian systems are important for many scientific and engineering problems. In this work, we propose kernel-based methods for identifying and forecasting Hamiltonian systems directly from data. We present two approaches: a two-step method that reconstructs trajectories before learning the Hamiltonian, and a one-step method that jointly infers both. Across several benchmark systems, including mass-spring dynamics, a nonlinear pendulum, and the Henon-Heiles system, we demonstrate that our framework achieves accurate, data-efficient predictions and outperforms two-step kernel-based baselines, particularly in scarce-data regimes, while preserving the conservation properties of Hamiltonian dynamics. Moreover, our methodology provides theoretical a priori error estimates, ensuring reliability of the learned models. We also provide a more general, problem-agnostic numerical framework that goes beyond Hamiltonian systems and can be used for data-driven learning of arbitrary dynamical systems.

Reductive homogeneous spaces associated with real forms. A gauge-theoretical generalisation
Nicolas Al Choueiry, Andrei Teleman
Comments:
15 pages, 1 figure
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
Let $G$ be a connected complex Lie group. A real form of $G$ is a closed subgroup $H\subset G$ whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ is a real form of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$. A pair $(G,H)$ of this type is reductive, and the corresponding quotient $G/H$ is a reductive homogeneous space whose canonical connection is torsion free. Regarded as a principal $H$-bundle over $G/H$, $G$ comes with tensorial 1-form $\alpha$ of type $\mathrm{Ad}$ and a natural left invariant connection $A$.
This remark suggests the following gauge theoretical generalisation of the class of reductive pairs of the form $(G,H)$ as above: Let $H$ be an arbitrary Lie group. A triple $(P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M,\alpha,A)$, where $P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M$ is a principal $H$-bundle, $\alpha$ a tensorial 1-form of type $\mathrm{Ad}$ on $P$ and $A$ a connection on $P$ will be called admissible if the induced linear maps $A_y\to \mathfrak{h}$, $y\in P$, are all isomorphisms. If this is the case one obtains a canonical linear connection $\nabla^\alpha_A$ on $M$ and a canonical almost complex structure $J^\alpha_A$ on $P$ which, by a result of R. Zentner, is integrable if an only if the pair $(\alpha,A)$ satisfies a gauge invariant first order differential system. A triple $(P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M,\alpha,A)$ as above will be called integrable if this integrability condition is satisfied. Any integrable triple $(P\stackrel{\pi}{\to}M,\alpha,A)$ with $M$ simply connected and $\nabla^\alpha_A$ complete can be identified with the triple associated with a real form of a complex Lie group. In this article we explain the strategy of the proof of this classification result and we prove in detail a theorem which plays an important role in this strategy and is of independent interest. In the last section we introduce the moduli spaces of integrable pairs on a principal bundle, and we give explicit examples.

Two combinatorial puzzles arising from the theory of Kohnert polynomials

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Motivated by recent work of Hanser and Mayers, we study two combinatorial puzzles arising from the theory of Kohnert polynomials. Such polynomials are defined as generating polynomials for certain collections of diagrams consisting of unit cells arranged in the first quadrant generated from an initial "seed diagram" by applying what are called "Kohnert moves". Each Kohnert move affects the position of at most cell of a diagram, attempting to move the rightmost cell of a given row to the first available position below and in the same column. In this paper, we study the combinatorial puzzles defined as follows: given a diagram $D$, form a diagram that is fixed by all Kohnert moves by applying either the fewest or most possible number of Kohnert moves. For both puzzles, we find complete solutions as well as methods for combinatorially computing the associated number of Kohnert moves in terms of the initial diagram $D$.

Almost sure global weak solutions and optimal decay for the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations

In this paper, we consider the initial value problem of the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes equations with initial data being in negative order Sobolev spaces, in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. The generalized Navier-Stokes equations studied here is obtained by replacing the standard Laplacian in the classical Navier-Stokes equations by the fractional order Laplacian $-(-\Delta)^\al$ with $\al \in \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{d+2}{4} \right]$. After an appropriate randomization on the initial data, we obtain the almost sure existence and optimal decay rate of global weak solutions when the initial data belongs to $\Dot{H}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $s\in (-\al+(1-\al)_+,0)$. Moreover, we show that the weak solutions are unique when $\al=\frac{d+2}{4}$ with $d \geq 2$.

A set partition is $c$-uniform if every block has size $c$. Two families of $c$-uniform partitions of a finite set are said to be cross $t$-intersecting if two partitions from different families share at least $t$ blocks. In this paper, we establish some product-type extremal results for such cross $t$-intersecting families. Our results yield an Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem and a Hilton-Milner theorem for uniform set partitions. Additionally, cross $t$-intersecting families with the maximum sum of their sizes are also characterized.

The partition function, $p_A(n)$, is defined to be the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in the set A, where $n$ is a positive integer and $A$ is a set of positive integers. It is well documented that: if A is a finite set with $\gcd(A)=1$ and $|A|=k$, then \[p_A(n)\sim \frac{n^{k-1}}{(\prod_{a\in A}a)(k-1)!}. \] Number of proofs have been obtained for this estimate. In this article, we give a new proof for the above estimate by making use of the fact that: $p_A(n)$ is a $quasi\ polynomial$ when A is a finite set. Present method of proof is purely combinatorial.

Probability (math.PR)
It is known that the exponential functional of a Poisson process admits a probability density function in the form of an infinite series. In this paper, we obtain an explicit expression for the density function of the exponential functional of any integer-valued subordinator, and by extension, limit representations for that of an arbitrary pure-jump subordinator. With an added positive drift, the density function is expressed via piecewise basis functions governed by a functional relation. Closed-form density functions for these cases have been established only for a few special instances of Lévy processes in the past literature. Our work substantially advances this line of research by providing an analytical perspective on the distribution of a broad class of exponential Lévy functionals, also suggesting potential methodological extensions to general purely discontinuous Lévy processes. Moreover, we consider arbitrary decreasing functionals of integer-valued subordinators by deriving sufficient and necessary conditions for their convergence, which are then applied to obtain limit-series representations for the density functions of inverse-power functionals. The numerical performance of the proposed formulae is demonstrated through various examples of well-known distributions.

Title:
On a Conjecture of Schilling Regarding the Coupon Collector's Problem
Daniel Berend, Tomer Sher
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Combinatorics (math.CO)
This article addresses a conjecture by Schilling concerning the optimality of the uniform distribution in the generalized Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) where, in each round, a subset (package) of $s$ coupons is drawn from a total of $n$ distinct coupons. While the classical CCP (with single-coupon draws) is well understood, the group-draw variant - where packages of size $s$ are drawn - presents new challenges and has applications in areas such as biological network models.
Schilling conjectured that, for $2 \leq s \leq n-1$, the uniform distribution over all possible packages minimizes the expected number of rounds needed to collect all coupons if and only if $s = n-1$. We prove Schilling's conjecture in full by presenting, for all other values of $s$, "natural" non-uniform distributions yielding strictly lower expected collection times. Explicit formulas and asymptotic analyses are provided for the expected number of rounds under these and related distributions.
The article further explores the behavior of the expected collection time as $s$ varies under the uniform distribution, including the cases where $s$ is constant, proportional to $n$, or nearly $n$.
Keywords: Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP), Group Drawings, Uniform Distribution, Expected Collection Time, Schilling's Conjecture, Optimal Distribution.

Fundamental Mechanisms of Human Learning

Information Theory (cs.IT); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)
Learning underlies nearly all human behavior and is central to education and education reform. Although recent advances in neuroscience have revealed the fundamental structure of learning processes, these insights have yet to be integrated into research and practice. Specifically, neuroscience has found that decision-making is governed by a structured process of perception, action-selection, and execution, supported by multiple neural systems with distinct memory stores and learning mechanisms. These systems extract different types of information (categorical, predictive, structural, and sequential) challenging canonical models of memory used in learning and behavioral science research by providing a mechanistic account of how humans acquire and use knowledge. Because each system learns differently, effective teaching requires alignment with system-specific processes. We propose a unified model that integrates these neuroscientific insights, bridging basic mechanisms with outcomes in education, identity, belonging, and wellbeing. By translating first principles of neural information processing into a generalizable framework, this work advances theories of skill acquisition and transfer while establishing a foundation for interdisciplinary research to refine how learning is understood and supported across domains of human behavior.

Optimized self-adaptive PID speed control for autonomous vehicles

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The main control tasks in autonomous vehicles are steering (lateral) and speed (longitudinal) control. PID controllers are widely used in the industry because of their simplicity and good performance, but they are difficult to tune and need additional adaptation to control nonlinear systems with varying parameters. In this paper, the longitudinal control task is addressed by implementing adaptive PID control using two different approaches: Genetic Algorithms (GA-PID) and then Neural Networks (NN-PID) respectively. The vehicle nonlinear longitudinal dynamics are modeled using Powertrain blockset library. Finally, simulations are performed to assess and compare the performance of the two controllers subject to external disturbances. Code can be found here: this https URL

Autonomous vehicles are the upcoming solution to most transportation problems such as safety, comfort and efficiency. The steering control is one of the main important tasks in achieving autonomous driving. Model predictive control (MPC) is among the fittest controllers for this task due to its optimal performance and ability to handle constraints. This paper proposes an adaptive MPC controller (AMPC) for the path tracking task, and an improved PSO algorithm for optimising the AMPC parameters. Parameter adaption is realised online using a lookup table approach. The propose AMPC performance is assessed and compared with the classic MPC and the Pure Pursuit controller through simulations.

In particular, we give an explicit proof using the space of Bianchi period polynomials constructed by Karabulut and describe the action of Hecke operators.

On efficient block Krylov-solvers for $\mathcal H^2$-matrices
Sven Christophersen
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Hierarchical matrices provide a highly memory-efficient way of storing dense linear operators arising, for example, from boundary element methods, particularly when stored in the H^2 format. In such data-sparse representations, iterative solvers are preferred over direct ones due to the cost-efficient matrix-vector multiplications they enable. Solving multiple systems of linear equations with the same hierarchical matrix naturally leads to block methods, which in turn make heavy use of BLAS level-3 functions such as GEMM. We present an efficient implementation of H^2-matrix-vector and H^2-matrix-matrix multiplication that fully exploits the potential of modern hardware in terms of memory and cache utilization. The latter is employed to accelerate block Krylov subspace methods, which we present later as the main results of this paper.

Comments welcome!
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We exhibit two instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon - one on dissections of a polygon of a fixed type and one on triangulations of a once-punctured polygon. We use these results to give refined enumerations of certain families of frieze patterns. We also give an interpretation of finite, positive integral frieze patterns fixed under nontrivial rotations as frieze patterns from a family of orbifolds and show that these are always unitary. Finally, we give a bijection between Holm-Jorgensen frieze patterns and p-Dyck paths, extending a recent construction of Canadas, Espinosa, Gaviria, and Rios, and discuss an induced rotation map on Dyck paths. Several conjectures and questions for future study are highlighted throughout the article.

Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions

Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.

In this short paper, we prove that the moduli of automorphisms of Frobenius twisted de Rham cohomology functor is given by $\mathbb{G}_m$. Our method is to use the notion of $\mathbb{G}_a^{\mathrm{perf}}$-modules and its connection to the de Rham cohomology functor introduced in \cite{M22}. As an application of the induced $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, we reprove a result of Bhatt, Petrov, and Vologodsky on the decomposition of the Frobenius twisted de Rham complex.

We study the following finite-rank Hardy-Lieb-Thirring inequality of Hardy-Schrödinger operator: \begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^N\left|\lambda_i\Big(-\Delta-\frac{c}{|x|^2}-V\Big)\right|^s\leq C_{s,d}^{(N)}\int_{\mathbb R^d}V_+^{s+\frac d2}dx, \end{equation*} where $N\in\mathbb N^+$, $d\geq3$, $0<c\leq c_*:=\frac{(d-2)^2}{4}$, $c_*>0$ is the best constant of Hardy's inequality, and $V\in L^{s+\frac d2}(\mathbb R^d)$ holds for $s>0$. Here $\lambda_i\big(-\Delta-{c}{|x|^{-2}}-V\big)$ denotes the $i$-th min-max level of Hardy-Schrödinger operator $H_{c,V}:=-\Delta-{c}{|x|^{-2}}-V $ in $\mathbb R^d$, which equals to the $i$-th negative eigenvalue (counted with multiplicity) of $H_{c,V}$ in $\mathbb R^d$ if it exists, and vanishes otherwise. We analyze the existence and analytical properties of the optimizers for the above inequality.

In this paper, we discuss all the possible pairs $(u,c)\in C(M,\mathbb R)\times\mathbb R$ solving (in the sense of viscosity) the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[ H (x, d_xu, u) = c,\quad x\in M \] of which $M$ is a closed manifold and the continuous Hamiltonian $H: (x,p,u)\in T^*M\times\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is convex, coercive in $p$ but merely non-decreasing in $u$. Firstly, we propose a comparison principle for solutions by using the dynamical information of Mather measures. We then describe the structure of $\mathfrak C$ containing all the $c\in\mathbb R$ makes previous equation solvable. We also propose examples to verify the optimality of our approach.

Lattice Models for Double Whittaker Polynomials and Motivic Chern Classes
Ben Brubaker, Daniel Bump, Andrew Hardt, Hunter Spink
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We will describe solvable lattice models whose partition functions depend on two sets of variables, $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \cdots $ that have different connections with the representation theory of $\text{GL}(n,F)$ where $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field. If the boundary conditions are chosen in one way, they are essentially the Motivic Chern classes that were used very effectively by Aluffi, Mihalcea, Schürmann and Su (AMSS) to study such problems. In particular, using this specialization we can obtain deformations $r_{u,v}$ of the Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomials that were used by Bump, Nakasuji and Naruse to study matrix coefficients of intertwining operators (introduced by Casselman). Thus we are able see that the recursion formula for the $r_{u,v}$ is a reflection of the Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, with more general boundary conditions, specializing the parameters $y_i\to 0$ we recover colored lattice models that were previously used by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump and Gustafsson to represent Iwahori Whittaker functions on $GL(n,F)$. Thus we term the resulting two-variable-set family of functions as ``double Whittaker polynomials.''

Non-directed polymers in random environments with range penalties: the high dimensional case
Niccolo Torri, Ran Wei
Comments:
23 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper is a follow-up work of arxiv.org/abs/2101.05949. We study a non-directed polymer model in random environments. The polymer is represented by a simple symmetric random walk $S$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq2$ and the random environment is represented by i.i.d. heavy-tailed random variables with their tail probability decaying polynomially. We perform a Gibbs transform to describe the interaction between polymers and random environments. Up to time $N$, the law of $S$ is tilted by $\exp(\sum_{x\in\mathcal{R}_N}(\beta\omega_x-h))$, where $\mathcal{R}_N$ is the range of $S$ up to time $N$, $\beta\geq0$ is the inverse temperature and $h\in\mathbb{R}$ is an external field. By tuning $\beta=\beta_N$ and $h=h_N$, we establish the phase diagram and study the fluctuations of $S$ under the Gibbs transform and the scaling limits of the (logarithmic) partition function. The novelty and challenge, compared to arxiv.org/abs/2101.05949, is that we also tune the external field $h$, which brings in various range penalties, unlike in arxiv.org/abs/2101.05949, where $h$ is fixed and merely playing a role of centering for the random environment.

Convex bodies with sections with hyperplanes of symmetry

Subjects:
Metric Geometry (math.MG)
Let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex body and let $p$ in the interior of $ K$, $n \geq 3$. The
point $p$ is said to be a \textit{Larman point} of $K$ if, for every hyperplane
$\Pi$ passing through $p$, the section $\Pi\cap K$ has a $(n-2)$-plane of
symmetry. If, in addition, for every hyperplane $\Pi$ passing through $p$, the
section $\Pi\cap K$ has a $(n-2)$-plane of symmetry which contains $p$,
then the point $p$ is called a revolution point. In this work we prove that if
for the convex body $K$, $n \geq 3$, there exists a
hyperplane $H$, a point $p$ such that $p$ is a Larman point of $K$ but
not a revolution point and, for every hyperplane $\Pi$ passing though $p$,
the section $\Pi \cap K$ has an $(n-2)$-plane of symmetry parallel to $H$,
then $K$ is an ellipsoid of revolution with an axis perpendicular to $H$.

Higher-order Casimir elements and hook partitions for quantum groups of types B, C and D

Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
The higher-order quantum Casimir elements, introduced by Zhang, Bracken, and Gould in the early 1990s, were conjectured to generate the centre of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum (super)groups. This was previously confirmed in the classical type A. In this paper we extend the result to the classical types B, C, D, with the additional inclusion of quantum Casimir elements arising from spin and half-spin representations in types B and D. We identify the Harish-Chandra images of these elements and reinterpret them uniformly in terms of irreducible characters associated with hook partitions. This yields explicit and minimal generating sets for the centres in all classical types, and provides new connections between higher-order quantum Casimir elements and hook partitions that exhibit a stability phenomenon.

We prove a new sufficient condition for two groups to be compatible. As a corollary, we obtain that nilpotent groups of the same order are compatible, and so are groups of the same square-free order.

Itô formula for reduced rough paths
Nannan Li, Xing Gao
Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The Itô formula, also known as the change-of-variables formula, is a cornerstone of Itô stochastic calculus. Over time, this formula has been extended to apply to random processes for which classical calculus is insufficient. Since every random process exhibits some degree of regularity, rough path theory provides a natural framework for treating them uniformly. In this paper, we extend the Itô formula for reduced rough paths, broadening the range of roughness from the previously known case $\frac{1}{3} < \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$ to the more singular regime $\frac{1}{4} < \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$.

First, we extend known results for binary trees from Musiker and Nguyen, including the endgame and the locations of the smallest and largest chips, as well as relations between chips at different vertices. Then, inspired by recent work on the binary tree by Inagaki, Khovanova, and Luo, we use these properties to construct an upper bound, which we call the zigzag bound, on the number of stable configurations in labeled chip-firing on $k$-ary trees with $\frac{k^{\ell}-1}{k-1}$ labeled chips starting at the root. We further provide a novel lower bound on the number of stable configurations of $k$-ary trees, complementing our upper bounds.

Bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures II: Tail profile of bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures in the exact scale-invariant case

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This is the second part of a series of papers where we consider questions related to the tail profile of the bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures appearing in boundary Liouville conformal field theory. In this part, we study of the right tail profile of a Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure with uniform singularity on the boundary, especially in the case of an exact scale-invariant kernel for the underlying log-correlated Gaussian field. This extends previous results by Rhodes-Vargas and Wong, where the case with flat background geometry (i.e. no boundary singularity) is studied using either the localization trick or some suitable versions of Tauberian theorems. Our generalization is non-trivial in the sense that we don't apply the localization trick to the bulk measure in question, but rather to an auxiliary Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure located at the boundary, on which the original bulk measure is not directly defined. We show that this modified localization scheme correctly captures the behavior of the right tail of the bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. The resulting tail profile coefficient is expressed in terms of a variant of bulk/boundary quotient of respective Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures, for which the well-definedness follows from preliminary joint moment bounds established previously in a companion paper.

We investigate the interaction between systolic geometry and positive scalar curvature through spinorial methods. Our main theorem establishes an upper bound for the two-dimensional stable systole on certain high-dimensional manifolds with positive scalar curvature under a suitable stretch-scale condition. The proof combines techniques from geometric measure theory, reminiscent of Gromov's systolic inequality, with curvature estimates derived from the Gromov-Lawson relative index theorem. This approach provides a new framework for studying the relationship between positive scalar curvature metrics and systolic geometry in higher-dimensional manifolds.

In this paper, we study equations with nonlinearity in the form of a double-well potential, randomised by a velocity-switching (telegraph) stochastic process. If the speed parameters of the randomisation are small, then this dynamics has one metastable uncertainty interval and two invariant attractors. The probabilities of leaving the metastable interval through the upper boundary are determined, as well as characteristics of the first crossing times. Invariant measures are also found. When and if the direction of the telegraph process velocity coincides with the direction of the periodic change in potential, the system can go into a metastable state, having received a time window for the interwell transition. The obtained results can be used as an alternative to stochastic resonance models.

The Asymptotic Analysis of Some PDE and Steklov Eigenvalue Problems with Partially Reactive Patches in 3-D
Denis S. Grebenkov, Michael J. Ward
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We consider steady-state diffusion in a three-dimensional bounded domain with a smooth reflecting boundary that is partially covered by small partially reactive patches. By using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, we investigate the competition of these patches for a diffusing particle and the crucial role of surface reactions on these targets. After a brief overview of former contributions to this field, we first illustrate our approach by considering the classical problems of the mean first-reaction time (MFRT) and the splitting probability for partially reactive patches characterized by a Robin boundary condition. For a spherical domain, we derive a three-term asymptotic expansion for the MFRT and splitting probabilities in the small-patch limit. This expansion is valid for arbitrary reactivities, and also accounts for the effect of the spatial configuration of patches on the boundary. Secondly, we consider more intricate surface reactions modeled by mixed Steklov-Neumann or Steklov-Neumann-Dirichlet problems. We provide the first derivation of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for these spectral problems in the small-patch limit for a spherical domain. Extensions of these asymptotic results to arbitrary domains and their physical applications are discussed.

Results on the upper and lower semicontinuity of functionals defined on spaces of convex and more general functions are established. In particular, the following result is obtained. Let $\phi(v; \cdot)$ be the density of the absolutely continuous part of a Radon measure $\Phi(v; \cdot)$ associated to a function $v\colon X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined on the measure space $(X,\lambda)$. For concave $\zeta\colon [0, \infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ with $\lim_{t\to 0} \zeta(t)=0$ and $\lim_{t\to\infty}\zeta(t)/t= 0$, it is shown that the functional $v\mapsto\int_{X} \zeta(\phi(v;x))\,\mathrm{d}\lambda(x)$ depends upper semicontinuously on $v$. Examples include so-called functional affine surface areas for convex functions.

On the long-time behavior of mean field game systems with a common noise

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we study the long-time behavior of mean field game (MFG) systems influenced by a common noise. While classical results establish the convergence of deterministic MFG towards stationary solutions under suitable monotonicity conditions, the introduction of a common stochastic perturbation significantly complicates the analysis. We consider a standard MFG model with infinitely many players whose dynamics are subject to both idiosyncratic and common noise. The central goal is to characterize the asymptotic properties as the horizon goes to infinity. By employing quantitative methods that replace classical compactness arguments unavailable in the stochastic context, we prove that solutions exhibit exponential convergence toward a stationary regime. Specifically, we identify a deterministic ergodic constant and demonstrate the existence of stationary random processes capturing the limiting behavior. Further, we establish almost sure long-time results thanks to a detailed analysis of the ergodic master equation, which is the long-time limit of the master equation. Our results extend known deterministic convergence phenomena to the stochastic setting, relying on novel backward stochastic PDE estimates.

We study infinite Euclidean distance discriminants of algebraic varieties, defined as the loci of data points whose fibers under the second projection from the Euclidean distance correspondence are positive-dimensional. In particular, these discriminants contain all data points with infinitely many critical points for the nearest-point problem. We present computer code that computes the infinite Euclidean distance discriminant, and use it to present numerous varieties with nonempty such discriminants. Moreover, we prove that for any data point, the fiber under the second projection is contained in a finite union of hyperspheres centered at that point. For curves, we include a complete characterization; their infinite Euclidean distance discriminants turn out to be affine linear spaces. Finally, we introduce and characterize skew-tube surfaces in three-dimensional space. By construction, these have a one-dimensional infinite Euclidean distance discriminant. We further demonstrate that many skew-tubes have significantly lower Euclidean distance degrees than generic surfaces of the same degree.

Title:
The Parity of Two Types of Cyclotomic Euler Sums via Contour Integrals
Ce Xu
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
In this paper, we employ methods of contour integration and residue calculus to investigate the parity of two classes of cyclotomic Euler-type sums. One class involves products of cyclotomic harmonic numbers, while the other involves products of cyclotomic odd harmonic numbers. We derive explicit formulas for the parity of linear and quadratic cases of these cyclotomic Euler-type sums and provide several illustrative examples. The results for the linear and quadratic cases ensure that we can provide explicit formulas for the parity of cyclotomic multiple $T$-values and cyclotomic multiple $S$-values up to depth three, both of which are even-odd variants of cyclotomic multiple zeta values. Furthermore, we present declarative theorems concerning the parity of these two types of cyclotomic Euler-type sums to arbitrary orders. Additionally, using contour integration techniques, we explore explicit linear and quadratic formulas for these cyclotomic Euler-type sums under more general conditions.

Generalized DP-colorings of digraphs
Lucas Picasarri-Arrieta, Michael Stiebitz
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
In this paper we consider the following three coloring concepts for digraphs. First of all, the generalized coloring concept, in which the same colored vertices of a digraph induce a subdigraph that satisfies a given digraph property. Second, the concept of variable degeneracy, introduced for graphs by Borodin, Kostochka and Toft in 2000; this allows to give a common generalization of the point partition number and the list dichromatic number. Finally, the DP-coloring concept as introduced for graphs by Dvořák and Postle in 2018, in which a list assignment of a graph is replaced by a cover. Combining these three coloring concepts leads to generalizations of several classical coloring results for graphs and digraphs, including the theorems of Brooks, of Gallai, of Erdős, Rubin, and Taylor, and of Bernshteyn, Kostochka, and Pron for graphs, and the corresponding theorems for digraphs due to Harutyunyan and Mohar. Our main result combines the DP-coloring and variable degeneracy concepts for digraphs.

In the last 20 years the Gelfond conjectures concerning the well distribution of the sum-of-digits function along prime numbers and along squares have been solved and these results, which are strongly connected with the Sarnak conjecture, were generalized to $q$-multiplicative functions and automatic sequences. In this paper we study a combination of both challenges and prove a Prime Number Theorem for $q$-multiplicative functions along squares which can be rewritten into a well distribution result along squares of primes.

In this paper, we consider the following zero mass Schrödinger-Bopp-Podolsky system
\[
\begin{cases}
-\Delta u +q^2\phi u=|u|^{p-2}u,
-\Delta \phi+a^2\Delta^2\phi=4\pi u^2,

\]
where $a>0$ and $q\ne 0$. We complete the study initiated in [2], which relied on a perturbation argument to establish the existence of weak solutions. Here, in contrast, our approach, based on the Mountain Pass Theorem and the splitting lemma, directly yields a ground state solution for $p \in (4,6)$.
Moreover, by deriving a Pohozaev identity, we further obtain some nonexistence results for suitable $p$. Finally, based on the minimax characterization, we also analyse, in the radial case, the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions obtained as $a\to 0$, thereby establishing a link with the zero mass Schrödinger-Poisson system.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
We prove that among all doubly connected and elastically supported planar membranes $\Omega$ with prescribed values of the area $|\Omega|$ and the lengths of the inner and outer boundaries $|\partial \Omega_{\rm{in}}|_1$, $|\partial \Omega_{\rm{out}}|_1$ satisfying $|\partial \Omega_{\rm{out}}|_1^2 - |\partial \Omega_{\rm{in}}|_1^2 = 4\pi |\Omega|$, the concentric annular membrane has the maximal fundamental frequency. The elastic constants $h_{\rm{in}}$, $h_{\rm{out}}$ on $\partial \Omega_{\rm{in}}$, $\partial \Omega_{\rm{out}}$, respectively, are assumed to satisfy $h_{\rm{in}} \cdot h_{\rm{out}} \geq 0$ and can admit negative values and $+\infty$, the latter being understood as a fixation of the membrane on the corresponding part of the boundary. Our study extends and unifies several existing results in the literature. The case $h_{\rm{in}} \cdot h_{\rm{out}} = 0$ is proved using the method of interior parallels à la Payne & Weinberger, and it requires less restrictive assumptions on $\Omega$. For the case $h_{\rm{in}} \cdot h_{\rm{out}} > 0$, we develop the construction of the so-called ``effectless cut'' of $\Omega$ described in terms of the gradient flow of the first eigenfunction. This concept was originally introduced by Weinberger and used by Hersch in the fixed boundary case, whose arguments we also revise.

A two-grid method with dispersion matching for finite-element Helmholtz problems
Christiaan C. Stolk

Journal-ref:
Advances in Computational Mathematics 51 (2025) article 43
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This work is about a new two-level solver for Helmholtz equations discretized by finite elements. The method is inspired by two-grid methods for finite-difference Helmholtz problems as well as by previous work on two-level domain-decomposition methods. For the coarse-level discretization, a compact-stencil finite-difference method is used that minimizes dispersion errors. The smoother involves a domain-decomposition solver applied to a complex-shifted Helmholtz operator. Local Fourier analysis shows the method is convergent if the number of degrees of freedom per wavelength is larger than some lower bound that depends on the order, e.g. more than 8 for order 4. In numerical tests, with problem sizes up to 80 wavelengths, convergence was fast, and almost independent of problem size unlike what is observed for conventional methods. Analysis and comparison with dispersion-error data shows that, for good convergence of a two-grid method for Helmholtz problems, it is essential that fine- and coarse-level dispersion relations closely match.

Edge version of the inducibility via the entropy method
Yichen Wang, Xiamiao Zhao, Mei Lu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The inducibility of a graph $H$ is about the maximum number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph on $n$ vertices. We consider its edge version, that is, the maximum number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph with $m$ edges. Let $c(G,H)$ be the number of induced copies of $H$ in $G$ and $\rho(H,m) = \max \{c(G,H) \mid |E(G)| = m\}$. For any graph $H$, we prove that $\rho(H,m) = \Theta(m^{\alpha_f(H)})$ where $\alpha_f(H)$ is the fractional independence number of $H$. Therefore, we now focus on the constant factor in front of $m^{\alpha_f(H)}$. In this paper, we give some results of $\rho(H,m)$ when $H$ is a cycle or path. We conjecture that for any cycle $C_k$ with $k \ge 5$, $\rho(C_k,m)= (1+o(1))\left( m/k\right)^{k/2}$ and the bound achieves by the blow up of $C_k$. For even cycles, we establish an upper bound with an extra constant factor. For odd cycles, we can only establish an upper bound with an extra factor depending on $k$. We prove that $\rho(P_{2l},m) \le \frac{m^l}{2(l-1)^{l-1}}$ and $\rho(P_{2l+1},m) \le \frac{m^{l+1}}{4l^l}$, where $l \ge 2$. We also conjecture the asymptotic value of $\rho(P_k, m)$. The entropy method is mainly used to prove our results.

Statistics Theory (math.ST)
This paper presents a novel approach to constructing estimators that dominate the classical James-Stein estimator under the quadratic loss for multivariate normal means. Building on Stein's risk representation, we introduce a new sufficient condition involving a monotonicity property of a transformed shrinkage function. We derive a general class of shrinkage estimators that satisfy minimaxity and dominance over the James-Stein estimator, including cases with polynomial or logarithmic convergence to the optimal shrinkage factor. We also provide conditions for uniform dominance across dimensions and for improved asymptotic risk performance. We present several examples and numerical validations to illustrate the theoretical results.

Chern classes of the multilayer fractional quantum Hall bundle on Riemann surfaces

Comments:
25 pages. Comments welcome!
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
The so-called multilayer wave functions were introduced in the study of the fractional Quantum Hall effect by Halperin and others. They are defined with the help of a symmetric matrix $K$ in $M^k(\mathbb{N})$, which encodes the couplings between the $k$ layers where particles live. We study the multilayer quantum states in the case where each layer is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. These states form a vector bundle over the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, or the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in physics terminology. Burban-Klevtsov have determined the rank and first Chern class of this bundle when $g=1$, and Klevtsov-Zvonkine computed the Chern character of this bundle in the single layer case for any genus. We generalize the latter approach to the multilayer case and compute the Chern character of the multilayer bundle for any genus, and any possible number of non-localized quasi-holes, under the assumption that the bilinear form associated to $K-I$ is non negative. The key tools are the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, Berezin integration and Wick's formula for exterior algebras. We show that when all quasi-holes are localized, the Chern character is compatible with the bundle being projectively flat. Furthermore, for those configurations, the conductance becomes independent of the genus and is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$, proving two conjectures by Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. We also find the relation linking $K$, the genus of the surface, the magnetic field and the number of non-localized quasi holes in each layer, which was studied under the name of ''shift formula''. Finally, we study conditions on the matrix $K$ under which states having only localized quasi-holes maximize the total particle number, as well as the asymptotics for large magnetic fields in this scenario.

Stationary fluctuations for occupation times of the long-range voter models on lattices
Xiaofeng Xue
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this paper, we are concerned with the long-range voter model on lattices. We prove a stationary fluctuation theorem for the occupation time of the model under a proper time-space scaling. In several cases, the fluctuation limits are driven by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameters in $(1/2, 1)$. The proof of our main result utilizes the martingale decomposition strategy introduced in \cite{Kipnis1987}. A local central limit theorem of the long-range random walk, the duality relationship between the model and the long-range coalescing random walk and a fluctuation theorem of the empirical density field of the model play the key roles in the proof.

Residual fertility and delay in sterile insect population dynamics
Ruqaya Hussein, Sergey Kryzhevich, Khosro Tajbakhsh
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
The sterile insect technique controls mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and yellow fever through either eradication or depressing the associated vector population. We formulate a three-dimensional delayed mosquito population suppression model with a saturated release rate to explore the interactive dynamics between wild, sterile, and non-sterile mosquitoes, focusing on the delay and residual fertility in the interactive dynamics among insects. We investigate the stability of the positive equilibrium and derive the Hopf bifurcation conditions. We establish the stability conditions for the positive equilibrium and examine how the time delay ($\tau$) and residual fertility affect the non-sterile insects' dynamics. Below the critical values of the delay, the system remains stable, while beyond that, the Hopf bifurcation is guaranteed under certain circumstances. However, analysis shows a clear band of non-sterile insect population values as residual fertility varies within a very narrow range. This suggests that within this interval, the system exhibits sensitive dependence on the fertility parameter, likely due to underlying nonlinear dynamics. Numerical simulations are presented to support our analytical results, followed by a brief discussion of the findings.

In this work, we propose a novel convolution product associated with the $\mathscr{H}$-transform, denoted by $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$, and explore its fundamental properties. Here, the $\mathscr{H}$-transform may be regarded as a refined variant of the classical Fourier, Hartley transform, with kernel function depending on two parameters $a,b$. Our first contribution shows that the space of integrable functions, equipped with multiplication given by the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution, constitutes the commutative Banach algebra over the complex field, albeit without an identity element. Second, we prove the Wiener--Lévy invertibility criterion for the $\mathscr H$-algebra and formulate Gelfand's spectral radius theorem. Third, we obtain a sharp form of Young's inequality for the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution and its direct corollary. Finally, all of these theoretical findings are applied to investigate specific classes of the Fredholm integral equations and heat source problems, yielding a priori estimates under the established assumptions.

Robust spectral preconditioning for high-Péclet number convection-diffusion
Lukas Holbach, Peter Bastian, Robert Scheichl
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce a two-level hybrid restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner for heterogeneous steady-state convection-diffusion equations at high Péclet numbers. Our construction builds on the multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM), wherein the coarse space is spanned by locally optimal basis functions obtained from local generalized eigenproblems on operator-harmonic spaces. Extending the theory of Ma (2025) to convection-diffusion problems in conservation form, we establish exponential convergence of the MS-GFEM approximation. Rewriting MS-GFEM as a RAS-type iteration, we show for coercive problems that this exponential convergence property is inherited by the RAS-type iterative method (at least in the continuous setting). Employed as a preconditioner within the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES), the resulting method requires only a few iterations for high accuracy even with low-dimensional coarse spaces.
Through extensive numerical experiments on problems with high-contrast diffusion and non-divergence-free, rotating velocity fields, we demonstrate robustness with respect to the grid Péclet number and the number of subdomains (tested up to $10^5$ subdomains), while coarse-space dimensions remain small as grid Péclet numbers increase. By adapting the coarse space and oversampling size, we are able to achieve arbitrarily fast convergence of preconditioned GMRES. As an extension, for which we do not have theory yet, we show effectiveness of the method even for indefinite problems and in the vanishing-diffusion limit.

On the spectral stability of the periodic capillary-gravity waves

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we investigate the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves in the two dimensional gravity-capillary water wave problem. We derive a stability criterion based on an index function, whose sign determines the spectral stability of the waves. This result aligns with earlier formal analyses by Djordjević \& Redekopp [15] and Ablowitz \& Segur [1], which employed the nonlinear Schrödinger approximation in the modulational regime. In particular, we show that instability is excluded near spectral crossings away from the origin when the surface tension is positive and the inverse square of the Froude number $\alpha\in(0,1),$ which results from the fact that the corresponding Krein signatures are identical. Numerical studies further reveal the existence of a decreasing curve $\beta=\beta(\alpha): (0,1)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+},$ such that the periodic waves are spectrally stable for all $\beta>\beta(\alpha)$. These findings highlight the stabilizing effect of surface tension on periodic capillary-gravity waves.

We give an explicit combinatorial description of the two-dimensional faces of both the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$ and the chain polytope $\mathcal{C}(P)$ of a partially ordered set $P$. Using these descriptions, we show that for any $P$, $\mathcal{C}(P)$ has equally many square faces, and at least as many triangular faces, as $\mathcal{O}(P)$ does. Moreover, the inequality is shown to be strict except when $\mathcal{O}(P)$ and $\mathcal{C}(P)$ are unimodularly equivalent. This proves the case $i=2$ of a conjecture by Hibi and Li.

We apply the theory of the Chow-Mumford line bundle as developed by Arezzo-et-al and build on earlier key insights of Paul and Tian (see \cite{Arezzo:DellaVedova:LaNave} and the references therein). In particular, we give an explicit intersection theoretic description of the Donaldson-Futaki $\K$-stability invariants that arise via deformation to the normal cones along subschemes and with respect to big and nef line bundles on projective varieties. In doing so we generalize to the case of big and nef line bundles the slope stability theory of Ross and Thomas \cite[Section 4]{Ross:Thomas:2006}. A key point to what we do here is the continuity property of the Chow Mumford line bundles with respect to the ample cones of projective varieties.

Minimization of Nonsmooth Weakly Convex Function over Prox-regular Set for Robust Low-rank Matrix Recovery

Optimization and Control (math.OC); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
We propose a prox-regular-type low-rank constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization model for Robust Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (RLRMR), i.e., estimate problem of low-rank matrix from an observed signal corrupted by outliers. For RLRMR, the $\ell_{1}$-norm has been utilized as a convex loss to detect outliers as well as to keep tractability of optimization models. Nevertheless, the $\ell_{1}$-norm is not necessarily an ideal robust loss because the $\ell_{1}$-norm tends to overpenalize entries corrupted by outliers of large magnitude. In contrast, the proposed model can employ a weakly convex function as a more robust loss, against outliers, than the $\ell_{1}$-norm. For the proposed model, we present (i) a projected variable smoothing-type algorithm applicable for the minimization of a nonsmooth weakly convex function over a prox-regular set, and (ii) a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of stationary point. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with the existing models that employ the $\ell_{1}$-norm.

Let $X = P^1_{\mathbb{F}_p}-B$, where $B$ is a divisor with $n$ distinct geometric points, and view $X$ as a $\mathbb{F}_q$-variety with $q = p^r$ for some $r$, we then obtain a short exact sequence of tame fundamental groups:
\[1\to \pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})\to \pi_1^t(X_{\mathbb{F}_q})\to \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)\to 1.\]
This gives rise to an action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ on $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$ once an $\mathbb{F}_q$-point in $X_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ is fixed. Using Harbater's formal patching, we prove a version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which further yields a purely algebraic description of the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the $n$ generators of $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$ assigned to each geometric point of $B_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}}$. Based on this, we give a purely algebraic computation of $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$, and thereby obtain an explicit description of the tame fundamental group of $X$.

Distributed Functional Optimization and Learning on Banach Spaces: Generic Frameworks
Zhan Yu, Zhongjie Shi, Deming Yuan, Daniel W. C. Ho
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we establish a distributed functional optimization (DFO) theory based on time-varying multi-agent networks. The vast majority of existing distributed optimization theories are developed based on Euclidean decision variables. However, for many scenarios in machine learning and statistical learning, such as reproducing kernel spaces or probability measure spaces that use functions or probability measures as fundamental variables, the development of existing distributed optimization theories exhibit obvious theoretical and technical deficiencies. This paper addresses these issues by developing a novel general DFO theory on Banach spaces, allowing functional learning problems in the aforementioned scenarios to be incorporated into our framework for resolution. We study both convex and nonconvex DFO problems and rigorously establish a comprehensive convergence theory of distributed functional mirror descent and distributed functional gradient descent algorithm to solve them. Satisfactory convergence rates are fully derived. The work has provided generic analyzing frameworks for distributed optimization. The established theory is shown to have crucial application value in the kernel-based distributed learning theory.

We study randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a capacity c on a measurable space ({\Omega},F), where the capacity c is distorted by a G-measurable random distortion function (with G a sub-{\sigma}-algebra of F). We establish some fundamental properties, including the comonotonic additivity of these integrals under suitable assumptions on the underlying capacity space. We provide a representation result for comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the first-order stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c) in terms of these randomly distorted Choquet integrals. We also present the case where the random distortion functions are concave. In this case, the G-randomly distorted Choquet integrals are characterised in terms of comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the stop-loss stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c). We provide examples, extending some well-known risk measures in finance and insurance, such as the Value at Risk and the Average Value at Risk.

Parameter estimation of integrated fractional Brownian motion

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a canonical model for long-memory phenomena. In the presence of large amounts of potentially memory-bearing data, the data are often averaged, which can change the structure of the underlying relationships and affect standard estimation procedures. To address this, we introduce the normalized integrated fractional Brownian motion (nifBm), defined as the average of fBm over a fixed interval. We derive its covariance structure, investigate the stationarity and self-similarity, and extend the framework to linear combinations of independent nifBms and models with deterministic drift. For such linear combinations, we establish stationarity of increments, investigate the asymptotic behavior of the autocovariance function, and prove an ergodic theorem essential for statistical inference. We consider two statistical models: one driven by a single nifBm and another by a linear combination of two independent nifBms, including cases with deterministic drift. For both models, we propose estimators that are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal for both the drift and the full parameter set. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings, providing a foundation for modeling averaged fractional dynamics, with potential applications in finance, energy markets, and environmental studies.

Incidence theorems for multivariate polynomials over finite fields
Chong Shangguan, Yulin Yang, Tao Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We prove several bounds on the number of incidences between two sets of multivariate polynomials of bounded degree over finite fields. From these results, we deduce bounds on incidences between points and multivariate polynomials, extending and strengthening a recent bound of Tamo for points and univariate polynomials. Our bounds are asymptotically tight for a wide range of parameters.
To prove these results, we establish a novel connection between the incidence problem and a naturally defined Cayley color graph, in which the weight of colored edges faithfully reflects the number of incidences. This motivates us to prove an expander mixing lemma for general abelian Cayley color graphs, which generalizes the classic mixing lemma of Alon and Chung, and controls the total weight of colored edges crossing two vertex subsets via eigenvalues.

A Computational Method for the Inverse Robin Problem with Convergence Rate
Erik Burman, Marvin Knöller, Lauri Oksanen
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
The inverse Robin problem covers the determination of the Robin parameter in an elliptic partial differential equation posed on a domain $\Omega$. Given the solution of the Robin problem on a subdomain $\omega \subset \Omega$ together with the elliptic problem's right hand sides, the aim is to solve this inverse Robin problem numerically. In this work, a computational method for the reconstruction of the Robin parameter inspired by a unique continuation method is established. The proposed scheme relies solely on first-order Lagrange finite elements ensuring a straightforward implementation. Under the main assumption that the Robin parameter is in a finite dimensional space of continuously differentiable functions it is shown that the numerical method is second order convergent in the finite element's mesh size. For noisy data this convergence rate is shown to hold true until the noise term dominates the error estimate. Numerical experiments are presented that highlight the feasibility of the Robin parameter reconstruction and that confirm the theoretical convergence results numerically.

We define the class of {\it unit uniquely clean} rings ({\it UnitUC} for short), that is a common generalization of uniquely clean rings and strongly nil clean rings. Abelian {\it UnitUC} rings are uniquely clean and {\it UnitUC} rings with nil Jacobson radical are strongly nil clean. These rings also generalize the UUC and CUC rings, defined by Calugareanu-Zhou in Mediterranean J. Math. (2023), which are rings whose clean elements are uniquely clean. These rings are also represent a natural generalization of the Boolian rings in that a ring is {\it UnitUC} if, and only if, it is exchange and Boolean modulo the Jacobson radical. The behavior of {\it UnitUC} rings under group ring and matrix ring extensions is investigated. Several examples are provided to explain and delimit the results.

Cohomology of non-finite CL-shellable posets
Guille Carrión Santiago, Antonio Díaz Ramos
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Combinatorics (math.CO); Group Theory (math.GR)
Shellable complexes are homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of possibly different dimensions, so that the (co)homology of the constant functor over the complex is concentrated in those degrees. In this work, we introduce the concept of a stable functor -a local weakening of fibrancy- over a shellable poset, which ensures the vanishing of the (co)homology of such a functor in specific degrees. In addition, we extend the notion of shellability to non-finite and non-pure posets. The methods are based on a model category structure on the category of functors indexed by a filtered poset and the combinatorial structure of CL-shellable posets. With these tools, we describe higher limits via explicit fibrant replacements. Applications include acyclicity criteria for Mackey functors, computation of cohomology of $j$-th exterior powers over arrangement lattices, and homological decompositions for Bianchi groups $\Gamma_d$ for $d=1,2,7$ and $11$.

Title:
Enveloping semigroups as compactifications of topological groups
K. L. Kozlov, B. V. Sorin
Subjects:
General Topology (math.GN); Group Theory (math.GR)
Ellis's "functional approach" allows one to obtain proper compactifications of a topological group $G$ if $G$ can be represented as a subgroup of the homeomorphism group of a space $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence and $G$-space $X$ is $G$-Tychonoff. These compactifications, called Ellis compactifications, are right topological monoids and $G$-compactifications of the group $G$ with its action by multiplication on the left on itself. A comparison is made between Ellis compactifications of $G$ and the Roelcke compactification of $G$. Uniformity corresponding to the Ellis compactification of $G$ for its representation in a compact space $X$ is established.
Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups ${\rm S}(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology and ${\rm Aut} (X)$ of LOTS $X$ in the topology of pointwise convergence.

Complex Variables (math.CV)
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate conjugate type properties for harmonic $(K,K')$-quasiregular mappings, where $K \geq 1$ and $K' \geq 0$ are constants. We first establish a Riesz type conjugate function theorem for such mappings, which generalizes and refines several existing results. Additionally, we derive an asymptotically sharp constant for a Riesz type theorem pertaining to a specific class of $K$-quasiregular mappings. Furthermore, we obtain Kolmogorov type and Zygmund type theorems for harmonic $(K,K')$-quasiregular mappings.

Group Theory (math.GR)
An element $x$ of a group $G$ is a commutator if it can be expressed in the form $x = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$ for some $a, b \in G$. In 2010 MacHale posed the following problem in the Kourovka notebook: does there exist a finite group $G$, with $|G| > 2$, such that there is exactly one element of $G$ which is not a commutator? We answer this question in the affirmative and provide an infinite series of such groups, the smallest group in our construction having size $16609443840$.

Non-Gaussian limits for diameter and perimeter of convex hulls of multiple random walks

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We prove large-time $L^2$ and distributional limit theorems for perimeter and diameter of the convex hull of $N$ trajectories of planar random walks whose increments have finite second moments. Earlier work considered $N \in \{1,2\}$ and showed that, for generic configurations of the mean drifts of the walks, limits are Gaussian. For perimeter, we complete the picture for $N=2$ by showing that the exceptional cases are all non-Gaussian, with limits involving an Itô integral (two walks with the same non-zero drift) or a geometric functional of Brownian motion (one walk with zero drift and one with non-zero drift), and establish Gaussian limits for generic configurations when $N \geq 3$. For the diameter we obtain a complete picture for $N \geq 2$, with limits (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) described explicitly in terms of the drift configuration. Our approach unifies old and new results in an $L^2$-approximation framework that provides a multivariate extension of Wald's maximal central limit theorem for one-dimensional random walk, and gives certain best-possible approximation results for the convex hull in Hausdorff sense. We also provide variance asymptotics and limiting variances are described explicitly.

Motivated by the recent work of Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin, we construct a sufficient condition for discrete subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, which lie between the supercritical and subcritical cases, to constitute Fourier uniqueness pairs. This family of critical uniqueness pairs includes pairs that are strongly asymmetric, stretching beyond those associated with zeros of zeta and L-functions, discovered by Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Seip, and getting close to the classical Shannon--Whittaker uniqueness pair.

Equivariant $H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-modules are wild

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
Let $k$ be an arbitrary field of characteristic $p$ and let $G$ be a finite group. We investigate the representation type, derived representation type, and singularity category of the $k$-linear (cohomological) Mackey algebra. We classify when the cohomological Mackey algebra is wild for $G$ a cyclic $p$-group. Furthermore, we show the cohomological Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two, and the Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group.
Derived wildness has some immediate consequences in equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, for the constant Mackey functor $\underline{k}$, the classification of compact modules over the $G$-equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum $H\underline{k}$ is also wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two. Thus, in contrast to recent work at the prime $2$ by Dugger, Hazel, and the second author, no meaningful classification of compact $C_p$-equivariant $H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-modules exists at odd primes. For the Burnside Mackey functor $\underline{A}_k$, there is no classification of compact $G$-equivariant $H\underline{A}_k$-modules whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group.

Generalizations of The Finite Height Criterion for Local Tabularity
Ilya B. Shapirovsky
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
It is well known that for transitive unimodal logics, finite height is both necessary and sufficient for local tabularity. It is also well known that for intermediate logics, finite height is sufficient (but not necessary) for local tabularity. For non-transitive unimodal, and for polymodal logics, finite height is necessary (but not sufficient) for local tabularity.
We discuss generalizations of the finite height criterion of local tabularity for families of non-transitive and polymodal logics. Then we discuss the finite modal depth property of modal logics and give a version of the finite height criterion for this property.

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
In this paper, we study two compactifications of general hypersurfaces defined by the vanishing of linear combinations of $d+2$ monomials in $d$-dimensional algebraic tori. We prove that the number of their $\mathbb{F}_q$-points is given by finite hypergeometric sums under certain general conditions. In the process, we introduce the notion of a gamma triple, which allows us to extend the classical definition of finite hypergeometric sums to prime powers corresponding to the cyclotomic field of definition of the associated monodromy representation. As a special case of our main results, we study the Dwork family and obtain a formula for the number of its $\mathbb{F}_q$-points. Our results generalise the work of Beukers, Cohen and Mellit for finite hypergeometric sums defined over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis versus Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture: a comparison

Subjects:

Thermalization of a closed chaotic quantum system is commonly addressed in terms of the eigenstate ther- malization hypothesis (ETH). An alternative approach uses the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture. The comparison shows that the two approaches differ significantly. In contrast to ETH, BGS fully uses the statistical properies of the chaotic Hamiltonian. In both approaches, the criterion for thermalization is similar. BGS goes beyond ETH in predicting quantitatively the time dependence of thermalization.

Stratification of the half-density quantization of the Jeffrey-Weitsman-Witten invariants
Adrian Chitan
Subjects:
Symplectic Geometry (math.SG); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In this paper we review the quantization procedure employed by Jeffrey and Weitsman in their formalization of Witten's three manifold invariants. In so doing, we formalize the stratification of the Lagrangian leaf which corresponds to the flat connections of a bounding surface which extend into the handlebody. The smooth structure of this space motivates a procedure for a stratified quantization: use volumes and corresponding half-densities on the stratified tangent bundle. The pairing is then defined such that the proposed BKS pairing still yields the torsion in the integrand of the Jeffrey-Weitsman-Witten invariant. The stratification yields a natural covariant constant half-density which results in a reduction of the structure group for reducible connections. The conditions of their integral are refined in the context of the stratification and this change reproduces the invariant exactly for a plethora of 3-manifolds and extends the invariant for some.

Distributed Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: A Federated Mirror Descent Approach with High Probability Convergence
Zhan Yu, Lan Liao, Deming Yuan, Daniel W. C. Ho, Ding-Xuan Zhou
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study the distributed stochastic optimization (DSO) problem under a heavy-tailed noise condition by utilizing a multi-agent system. Despite the extensive research on DSO algorithms used to solve DSO problems under light-tailed noise conditions (such as Gaussian noise), there is a significant lack of study of DSO algorithms in the context of heavy-tailed random noise. Classical DSO approaches in a heavy-tailed setting may present poor convergence behaviors. Therefore, developing DSO methods in the context of heavy-tailed noises is of importance. This work follows this path and we consider the setting that the gradient noises associated with each agent can be heavy-tailed, potentially having unbounded variance. We propose a clipped federated stochastic mirror descent algorithm to solve the DSO problem. We rigorously present a convergence theory and show that, under appropriate rules on the stepsize and the clipping parameter associated with the local noisy gradient influenced by the heavy-tailed noise, the algorithm is able to achieve satisfactory high probability convergence.

Commutativity of operator algebras

Comments:

Subjects:
Operator Algebras (math.OA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We call an operator algebra A reversible if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the symmetric operator algebras: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a rather technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relation from mathematical physics plays a significant role.

Eyring-Kramers formula for the mean exit time of non-Gibbsian elliptic processes: the non characteristic boundary case

Subjects:

In this work, we derive a new sharp asymptotic equivalent in the small temperature regime $h\to 0$ for the mean exit time from a bounded domain for the non-reversible process $dX\_t=b(X\_t)dt + \sqrt h \, dB\_t$ under a generic orthogonal decomposition of $b$ and when the boundary of $\Omega$ is assumed to be \textit{non characteristic}. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that we do not assume that the process $(X\_t,t\ge 0)$ is \textit{Gibbsian}. In this case, a new correction term characterizing the \textit{non-Gibbsianness} of the process appears in the equivalent of the mean exit time. The proof is mainly based on tools from spectral and semi-classical analysis.

Boundary pointwise regularity for the divergence form elliptic boundary problem on uniform domain
Tianyu Guan, Lihe Wang, Chunqin Zhou
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we study the boundary pointwise regularity for the divergence form elliptic boundary problem. In generality, it is not convenient to define weak solutions for nonzero boundary data on domain with the rough boundary, e.g. uniform domain. However, in this paper, we introduce a definition of weak solutions for the boundary problem on uniform domain. What is interesting is that this definition can be considered to analysis the regularity of weak solutions. In particular, by establishing the energy inequality, we show the boundary pointwise $C^\alpha$ regularity by using compactness methods under the admissible condition. Furthermore, by establishing the linear property of solutions with respective to the harmonic functions, we also prove the boundary pointwise $C^{1,\alpha}$ and $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularities if the boundary data and the boundary of domain are pointwise $C^{1,\alpha}$ and $C^{2,\alpha }$ respectively.

Large smooth twins from short lattice vectors

Finding the largest pair of consecutive $B$-smooth integers is computationally challenging. Current algorithms to find such pairs have an exponential runtime -- which has only be provably done for $B \leq 100$ and heuristically for $100 < B \leq 113$. We improve this by detailing a new algorithm to find such large pairs. The core idea is to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP) in a well constructed lattice. With this we are able to significantly increase $B$ and notably report the heuristically largest pair with $B = 751$ which has $196$-bits. By slightly modifying the lattice, we are able to find larger pairs for which one cannot conclusively say whether it is the largest or not for a given $B$. This notably includes a $213$-bit pair with $B = 997$ which is the largest pair found in this work.

Congruences modulo powers of 2 and 3 for overpartition $k$-tuples
G. Kavya Keerthana, S. Ananya, Ranganatha D
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Let $\overline{p}_{k}(n)$ denote the number of overpartition $k$-tuples of $n$. In 2023, Saikia \cite{saikia} conjectured the following congruences: \begin{align*} \overline{p}_{q}(8n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{4},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+3)\equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{2},\\ \overline{p}_{q}(8n+5)& \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+6) \equiv 0 \pmod{8},\quad \overline{p}_{q}(8n+7)\equiv 0 \pmod{32}, \end{align*} where $n\geq0$ and $q$ is prime. Recently, Sellers \cite{sellers2024elementary} showed that these congruences hold for all odd integers $q$ (not necessarily prime). In this paper, we show that the above congruences hold for all positive integers $q$ (not necessarily odd). We also prove the following congruences on $\overline{OPT}_k(n)$, the number of overpartition $k$-tuples with odd parts of $n$: For all $i,j\geq 1$, $n\geq 0$, $r$ not a multiple of 2, $k$ not a multiple of 2 or 3, and $\ell$ not a power of 2, nor a multiple of 2 or 3, we have \begin{align*} \overline{OPT}_{2^i\cdot r}(8n+7)& \equiv 0 \pmod{2^{i+4}},
\overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2^{j+2}},
\overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot 2^j\cdot k}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2^{j+1}},\\ \overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+2)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i+1}\cdot 2},
\overline{OPT}_{3^i\cdot \ell}(3n+1)& \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{i}\cdot 2},\end{align*}

We initiate and study the theory of ``real decomposable maps" between real operator systems. (Formally, this is new even in the complex case, which hitherto has restricted itself to the case where the systems are complex $C^*$-algebras.) We investigate how the definition interacts with the existing theory (which it generalizes) and with the complexification. A surprising term appears in the `Jordan decomposition' of real decomposable maps. This term constitutes a new class of completely bounded maps, a class that also showed up in disguised form in our recent study of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, and whose theory is likely to have applications in that subject. We also check the real case of many important known results related to decomposability, for example about the weak expectation property or injectivity of von Neumann algebras.

We derive two forms of conditional a posteriori error estimates for a finite volume scheme approximating the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system. The estimates control the error in the $L^\infty(0,T, L^2(\Omega))$- and $L^2(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$-norm and exhibit linear convergence in the mesh size, as observed in numerical experiments. Crucially, we show that as long as the condition of the error estimate is satisfied a weak solution exits. This means, as long as the numerical solution has good properties, we can rigorously infer existence of an exact solution.

Quantum algorithms for time-fractional equations
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We develop a quantum algorithm for solving high-dimensional time-fractional heat equations. By applying the dimension extension technique from [CS07], the $d+1$-dimensional time-fractional equation is reformulated as a local partial differential equation in $d+2$ dimensions. Through discretization along both the extended and spatial domains, a stable system of ordinary differential equations is obtained by a simple change of variables. We propose a quantum algorithm for the resulting semi-discrete problem using the Schrodingerization approach from [JLY24a,JLY23,JL24a]. The Schrodingerization technique transforms general linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schrodinger-type systems--with unitary evolution, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This is accomplished via the warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. We provide detailed implementations of this method and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis, demonstrating up to exponential advantage--with respect to the inverse of the mesh size in high dimensions~--~compared to its classical counterparts. Specifically, to compute the solution to time $T$, while the classical method requires at least $\mathcal{O}(N_t d h^{-(d+0.5)})$ matrix-vector multiplications, where $N_t $ is the number of time steps (which is, for example, $\mathcal{O}(Tdh^{-2})$ for the forward Euler method), our quantum algorithms requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^2d^4 h^{-8})$ queries to the block-encoding input models, with the quantum complexity being independent of the dimension $d$ in terms of the inverse mesh size $h^{-1}$. Numerical experiments are performed to validate our formulation.

We investigate sign patterns of coefficients in the Ehrhart polynomial of the Cartesian product between the $r$-th pyramid over the Reeve tetrahedron and the hypercube $[0,n]^n$. This yields partial results on the sign pattern problem for Ehrhart polynomials. Moreover, we shown that for each $d\geq 4$, there exists a $d$-dimensional integral polytope $\mathcal{P}$ such that an arbitrary number of low-degree coefficients in the Ehrhart polynomial $i(\mathcal{P},t)$ are negative, while all remaining higher-degree coefficients are positive. Finally, we establish five embedding theorems that enables the sign pattern of a lower-dimensional integral polytope to be embedded into a highly-dimensional integral polytope in various ways. As an application, we provide an affirmative answer to the sign pattern problem for $d=7,8,9$.

On the Enumeration of Symmetric Tridiagonal Matrices with prescribed Determinant over Commutative Finite Chain Rings

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
Determinants of structured matrices play a fundamental role in both pure and applied mathematics, with wide-ranging applications in linear algebra, combinatorics, coding theory, and numerical analysis. In this work, the enumeration of symmetric tridiagonal matrices with prescribed determinant over finite fields and over commutative finite chain rings is developed. Using the recurrent formula for determinants, a recursive form of the numbers of singular and nonsingular symmetric tridiagonal matrices is derived, after which a uniform counting framework for any fixed determinant value is obtained. Over finite fields, quadratic-character techniques are employed. In odd dimensions, the enumeration is shown to be independent of the chosen nonzero determinant. Whereas, in even dimensions, it depends only on the quadratic residue/nonresidue class in the fields. For commutative finite chain rings, explicit formulas for nonsingular case are produced by lifting along the ideal chain and analyzing reduction to the residue field, yielding closed expressions in terms of the nilpotency index and the size of the residue fields. A layered enumeration has been developed for the study of symmetric tridiagonal matrices over commutative finite chain rings by stratifying determinants into ideal and punctured layers. Entry-wise reduction to quotient rings expresses each layer through zero-determinant counts on quotients, yielding formulas for prescribed determinants, including quadratic/non-quadratic residue factors, and a decomposition for the singular ones.

Symbol Detection in Inter-Symbol Interference Channels using Expectation Propagation with Channel Shortening

Comments:
Submitted to ICASSP
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Iterative message passing detection based on expectation propagation(EP) has demonstrated near-optimum performance in many signal processing and communication scenarios. The method remains feasible even for channel impulse responses (CIRs), where the optimal Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) detector is infeasible. However, significant performance degradation occurs for channels with strong inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the initial linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimate is inaccurate. We propose an EP-based detector that operates in a transformed signal space obtained by channel shortening. Specifically, instead of the conventional approach that iterates between an LMMSE estimator and a non-linear symbol-wise demapper, the proposed method iterates between a linear channel shortening filter-based estimator and a nonlinear BCJR detector with reduced memory compared to the actual channel. Additionally, we propose a deliberate mismatch between the initialized messages and the initialized covariance used in the linear estimator in the first iteration for faster convergence. The proposed approach is evaluated for the well-known Proakis-C ISI channel and for CIRs from a wireless measurement campaign. We demonstrate improvements of up to 6dB at 2 bits per channel use and an improved performance-complexity trade-off over conventional EP-based detection.

Two-dimensional (2D) electronic materials are of significant technological interest due to their exceptional properties and broad applicability in engineering. The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable configurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of multiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at larger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and near-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant spatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density field -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell -- is used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by exploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly oscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are much larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling.
In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the charge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of problems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the continuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much smaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing. These limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms of the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process. Further, we demonstrate that despite the intrinsic non-uniqueness in the definition of polarization, accounting for the boundary charges ensures that the total electrostatic potential, the associated electric field, and the corresponding energy of the homogenized system are uniquely determined.

Oriented trees in digraphs with large girth

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The girth of a graph $G$ is the length of a shortest cycle of $G$. Jiang (JCT-B, 2001) showed that every graph $G$ with girth at least $2\ell+1$ and minimum degree at least $k/\ell$ contains every tree $T$ with $k$ edges whose maximum degree does not exceed the minimum degree of $G$. Let $\delta^0(D)$ be the minimum semidegree of a digraph $D$ and $\Delta(D)$ be the maximum degree of $D$. In this paper, we establish a digraph version of Jiang's result, stating that every oriented graph $D$ of girth at least $2\ell+1$ with $\delta^0(D)\ge \max\{k/\ell,\Delta(T)\}$ contains every oriented tree with $k$ edges, that answers a question raised by Stein and Trujillo-Negrete in affirmative.

We define F as the set of semi-infinite sequence f such that the resulting sequence q exists. This requires that the term q(n-q(n-1)) be defined for all n, that is, 0 < q(n) < n+1 applies for all n in N.

Edge-reinforced branching random walk on a triangle
Giordano Giambartolomei, Nadia Sidorova
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
The edge-reinforced random walk (ERRW) is a random process on the vertices of a graph that is more likely to cross the edges it has visited in the past. Depending on the strength of the reinforcement, the ERRW of a single particle can either exhibit localisation (eventually moving back and forth across a single edge) or remain transient. We consider a model where a single ERRW is replaced by that of an exponentially growing number of random particles, and we study its localisation properties on the triangle. Using the dynamical systems approach we analyse the frequencies with which the edges are traversed and prove their almost sure convergence. We discuss the scenarios when those frequencies become negligible for one or two edges (dominance). We also discuss the situation when an edge stops being traversed entirely (monopoly).

Quickest Change Detection in Continuous-Time in Presence of a Covert Adversary

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)
We investigate the problem of covert quickest change detection in a continuous-time setting, where a Brownian motion experiences a drift change at an unknown time. Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who adjusts the post-change drift $\mu = \mu(\gamma)$ as a function of the false alarm constraint parameter $\gamma$, with the goal of remaining undetected for as long as possible. Leveraging the exact expressions for the average detection delay (ADD) and average time to false alarm (AT2FA) known for the continuous-time CuSum procedure, we rigorously analyze how the asymptotic behavior of ADD evolves as $\mu(\gamma) \to 0$ with increasing $\gamma$. Our results reveal that classical detection delay characterizations no longer hold in this regime. We derive sharp asymptotic expressions for the ADD under various convergence rates of $\mu(\gamma)$, identify precise conditions for maintaining covertness, and characterize the total damage inflicted by the adversary. We show that the adversary achieves maximal damage when the drift scales as $\mu(\gamma) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\gamma})$, marking a fundamental trade-off between stealth and impact in continuous-time detection systems.

In this paper, we explore how functor-induced isomorphisms are encoded by $G$-matrices. We first show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a tilting module can be realized via the $G$-matrix of this tilting module. Building on this, we compare $g$-vectors for a tilted algebra and its associated hereditary algebra, and provide $G$-matrix interpretations of the Coxeter transformation, the Nakayama functor, and the Auslander-Reiten translation for suitable algebras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that every element of any symmetric group and Weyl group can be expressed as the transpose of the $G$-matrix of some tilting module or support $\tau$-tilting module. Finally, we show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a $2$-term silting complex can also be realized via the $G$-matrix of this $2$-term silting complex.

An Optimal Control Interpretation of Augmented Distributed Optimization Algorithms
Liam Hallinan, Ioannis Lestas
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
Distributed optimization algorithms are used in a wide variety of problems involving complex network systems where the goal is for a set of agents in the network to solve a network-wide optimization problem via distributed update rules. In many applications, such as communication networks and power systems, transient performance of the algorithms is just as critical as convergence, as the algorithms link to physical processes which must behave well. Primal-dual algorithms have a long history in solving distributed optimization problems, with augmented Lagrangian methods leading to important classes of widely used algorithms, which have been observed in simulations to improve transient performance. Here we show that such algorithms can be seen as being the optimal solution to an appropriately formulated optimal control problem, i.e., a cost functional associated with the transient behavior of the algorithm is minimized, penalizing deviations from optimality during algorithm transients. This is shown for broad classes of algorithm dynamics, including the more involved setting where inequality constraints are present. The results presented improve our understanding of the performance of distributed optimization algorithms and can be used as a basis for improved formulations.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we propose a novel numerical scheme for solving time-fractional reaction-diffusion problems with Robin boundary conditions, where the time derivative is in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved. Our proposed method is based on the spectral collocation method in space and Fractional Hamiltonian boundary value methods in time. For the considered spectral collocation method, the basis functions used are not the standard polynomial basis functions, but rather adapt to Robin boundary conditions, and the exponential convergence property is provided. The proposed procedure achieves spectral accuracy in space and is also capable of getting spectral accuracy in time. Some numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results.

Subjects:

We investigate the stabilizability of linear discrete-time switched systems with singular matrices, focusing on the spectral radius in this context. A new lower bound of the stabilizability radius is proposed, which is applicable to any matrix set. Based on this lower bound, more relationships between the stabilizability radius and joint spectral subradius are established. Detailed analysis of the stabilizability radius of a special kind of two-dimensional switched system, consisting of a singular matrix and a rotation matrix, is presented. The Hausdorff dimensions of the parameter sets such that the stabilizability radius of these systems equals a constant are also presented. Other properties of switched systems with singular matrices are also discussed along with examples.

Let $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$ be two domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with Kobayashi metrics $k_{\Omega_i}$ and consider $f \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega_1,\Omega_2)$ a holomorphic mapping. Let $\mathfrak{F}_1$ and $\mathfrak{F}_2$ be a family of geodesics defined on $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ respectively, where a geodesic between $z$ and $w$ in $\Omega_i$ is the length minimizing curve between the two points for the metric $k_{\Omega_i}$. We say that a holomorphic function \textit{preserves geodesics} if for any geodesic $\gamma_1$ in $\mathfrak{F}_1$ its image is a subset of a geodesic $\gamma_2$ in $\mathfrak{F}_2$ ($f(\gamma_1)\subset \gamma_2$). We aim to characterise the family of such functions between families of Kobayashi geodesics passing through a point in the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ and in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$. Some additional results in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$.

On the mean-field limit for the for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions

We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|>N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.

Expansion of Integer Matrices over Various Rings
Jakub Szymański
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
In this article, we explore the problem of constructing high-dimensional expanders through the study of relations between expansion constants over different rings. We investigate expansion constants of integer matrices regarded as morphisms between free modules over $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, and $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce a new condition which we call integral spanning regarding kernels of integer matrices, and prove that it ensures equality of real and integral expansions. In addition, we prove a bound on expansion constants over finite fields for a certain class of matrices in terms of the corresponding integral expansions. As an application, one may use this theorem to bound the expansion of codifferentials over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ in degrees $0$ and $1$.

Planar induced paths via a decomposition into non-crossing ordered graphs
Julien Duron, Hugo Jacob
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
In any graph, the maximum size of an induced path is bounded by the maximum size of a path. However, in the general case, one cannot find a converse bound, even up to an arbitrary function, as evidenced by the case of cliques. Galvin, Rival and Sands proved in 1982 that, when restricted to weakly sparse graphs, such a converse property actually holds.
In this paper, we consider the maximal function $f$ such that any planar graph (and in general, any graph of bounded genus) containing a path on $n$ vertices contains an induced path of size $f(n)$, and prove that $f(n) \in \Theta \left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)$ by providing a lower bound matching the upper bound obtained by Esperet, Lemoine and Maffray, up to a constant factor. We obtain these tight bounds by analyzing graphs ordered along a Hamiltonian path that admit an edge partition into a bounded number of sets without crossing edges. In particular, we prove that when such an ordered graph can be partitioned into $2k$ sets of non-crossing edges, then it contains an induced path of size $\Omega_k\left(\left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)^{1/k} \right)$ and provide almost matching upper bounds.

Parametrized topological complexity of bundles of real projective spaces, I

Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT)
Analysis of motion algorithms for autonomous systems operating under variable external conditions leads to the concept of parametrized topological complexity \cite{CFW}. In \cite{CFW}, \cite{CFW2} the parametrized topological complexity was computed in the case of the Fadell - Neuwirth bundle which is pertinent to algorithms of collision free motion of many autonomous systems in ${\Bbb R}^d$ avoiding collisions with multiple obstacles. The parametrized topological complexity of sphere bundles was studied in detail in \cite{FW}, \cite{FW2}, \cite{FP}. In this paper we make the next step by studying parametrized topological complexity of bundles of real projective spaces which arise as projectivisations of vector bundles. This leads us to new problems of algebraic topology involving theory of characteristic classes and geometric topology. We establish sharp upper bounds for parametrized topological complexity ${\sf TC}[p:E\to B]$ improving the general upper bounds. We develop algebraic machinery for computing lower bounds for ${\sf TC}[p:E\to B]$ based on the Stiefel - Whitney characteristic classes. Combining the lower and the upper bounds we compute explicitly many specific examples.

Quasi-isometric Higman embeddings and the Dehn function

Group Theory (math.GR)
This is the first of a sequence of papers devoted to studying the link between the complexity of the Word Problem for a finitely generated recursively presented group $G$ and the isoperimetric functions of the finitely presented groups in which $G$ embeds. We prove here that if a finitely generated group has a presentation $\mathcal{P}$ whose relators can be enumerated by a computational model satisfying certain technical requirements, then the group embeds quasi-isometrically into a finitely presented group whose Dehn function is bounded above by a function of the model's computational complexity and the Dehn function of $\mathcal{P}$. This generalizes a previous result of the author pertaining to the embeddings of free Burnside groups and gives a recipe for establishing such Higman embeddings into groups with desired geometric properties. As an example of the use of this embedding scheme, we find a substantial improvement to the seminal result of Birget, Ol'shanskii, Rips, and Sapir showing that the Word Problem of a finitely generated group is in class NP if and only if the group embeds into a finitely presented group with polynomial Dehn function.

Chow polynomials of totally nonnegative matrices and posets

Combinatorics (math.CO)
Huh-Stevens and Ferroni-Schröter independently conjectured that the Hilbert-Poincaré series of the Chow ring of any geometric lattice has only real zeros, and Ferroni, Matherne and the second author extended this conjecture to the Chow polynomial of any Cohen-Macaulay poset. In this paper we address these conjectures by providing new defining relations and properties of Chow functions of posets and matrices. These are used, in conjunction with new techniques on interlacing sequences of polynomials, to prove that the Chow polynomial of any lower triangular and totally nonnegative matrix with all diagonal entries equal to one is real-rooted. This in turn is used to prove the above conjectures for a large class of posets and matroids that includes projective and affine geometries, dual partition and Dowling lattices, perfect matroid designs and paving matroids.
A consequence of our theory is a vast generalization of a recent theorem of Athanasiadis on real-rootedness preserving properties of the Eulerian transformation, which was conjectured by the first author and Jochemko.
We study Chow polynomials of Toeplitz matrices in greater detail. These turn out to be related to a family of generalized Eulerian polynomials with coefficients in the ring of symmetric polynomials that have been studied frequently in the literature, by e.g. Stanley, Brenti, Stembridge and Shareshian-Wachs. Hence the theory developed in this paper serves as a framework for these polynomials, which are proved to be real-rooted by our methods (when suitably specialized).

The goal of this paper is to undertake an in-depth study of the phenomenon behind the Furstenberg--Sárközy theorem, which, in its modern form due to Kamae and Mendès-France, states that if $E$ is a set of integers with positive density and $P$ is an intersective polynomial, then there are distinct elements $x, y \in E$ such that $x - y = P(n)$ for some some $n$.
In this paper, we identify an algebraic framework (rings of integers of global fields) for Furstenberg--Sárközy-type theorems. One of our main results establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to satisfy the Furstenberg--Sárközy theorem over the ring of integers of a global field, providing an extension of the result of Kamae and Mendès-France.
The Furstenberg--Sárközy phenomenon goes beyond infinite rings and has interesting additional aspects in finite rings. As an example, classical exponential sum estimates can be used to show that large subsets of finite fields contain the asymptotically ``correct'' number of pairs $(x,y)$ whose difference is a square. In previous work, the class of polynomials satisfying this strong form of the Furstenberg--Sárközy theorem over finite fields was classified. In the present paper, we establish asymptotic results characterizing sequences of finite principal ideal rings that produce ``correct'' statistics in the Furstenberg--Sárközy theorem and show that these families are much more general than finite fields.
As an application of our enhanced forms of the Furstenberg--Sárközy theorem over finite rings, we produce new families of examples of quasirandom graphs of algebraic origin. The production of these new examples hinges on a two-way connection between asymptotic total ergodicity -- the phenomenon responsible for enhanced versions of the Furstenberg--Sárközy theorem over finite fields and rings -- and quasirandomness.

Let $d(n)$ be the divisor function and it is well known that $\sum_{1\leq n \leq x}d(n) = x\log x+(2\gamma-1)x +\mathcal{O}\left(x^{\theta+\epsilon}\right)$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler constant, $\epsilon>0$ and $1/4<\theta<1/3$. In this paper, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{so}(5)$. More precisely, the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ are a family of representations of dimension $jk(j+k)(j+2k)/6$ for $j, k\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ and suppose that $\varrho_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}(n)$ is the number of irreducible $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ representations of dimension $n$. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the summatory function $\sum_{1\leq n \leq x}\varrho_{\mathfrak{so}(5)}(n)$.

Motion of a massive rigid loop in a 3D perfect incompressible flow

Comments:

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We consider the motion of a rigid body immersed in an inviscid incompressible fluid. In 2D, an important physical effect associated with this system is the famous Kutta-Joukowski effect. In the present paper, we identify a similar effect in the 3D case. For this, we first recast the Newtonian dynamics of the rigid body as a first-order nonlinear ODE for the $6$-component body velocity, in the body frame. Then, we focus on the particular case where the rigid body occupies a slender tubular domain with a smooth closed curve as the centerline and a circular cross-section, in the limit where the radius goes to zero, with fixed inertia and circulation around the curve. We establish that the dynamics of the limit massive rigid loop are given by a first-order nonlinear ODE with coefficients that depend only on the inertia, on the fluid vorticity, and on the limit curve through two $3$D vectors, which are involved in a skewsymmetric $6 \times 6$ matrix that appears in the limit force and torque, a structure which is reminiscent of the 2D Kutta-Joukowski effect. We also identify the limit fluid dynamics as, where, as in the case of the Euler equation alone, the vorticity evolves according to the usual transport equation with stretching, but with a velocity field that is due not only to the fluid vorticity but also to a vorticity filament associated with the circulation around the limit rigid loop. This result is in stark contrast with the case where the filament is made of fluid, with non-zero circulation, since in the latter, the filament velocity becomes infinite in the zero-radius limit. However, considering the inertia scaling that corresponds to a fixed density, we prove that there are solutions for which the solid velocity and its displacement tend to infinity over a time interval of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

Integer solutions of Pell equation in bounded regions

The Pell equation $x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$ with non-square $D > 1$ has infinitely many integer solutions, yet most research has centered on the asymptotic behavior of fundamental units as $D$ varies. By contrast, the exact distribution of solutions for a fixed $D$ within bounded regions has received little attention. In this paper, we contribute to this direction by giving an explicit enumeration of all solutions to the Pell equation inside the square $|x| + |y| \leq \lambda$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We further extend our results to the shifted Pell equation $\left(x-a\right)^2 - D\left(y-b\right)^2 = 1$ for integers $a$ and $b$, obtaining exact counts for sufficiently large $\lambda$.

Improving Cramér-Rao Bound And Its Variants: An Extrinsic Geometry Perspective

This work presents a geometric refinement of the classical Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) by incorporating curvature-aware corrections based on the second fundamental form associated with the statistical model manifold. That is, our formulation shows that relying on the extrinsic geometry of the square root embedding of the manifold in the ambient Hilbert space comprising square integrable functions with respect to a fixed base measure offers a rigorous (and intuitive) way to improve upon the CRB and some of its variants, such as the Bhattacharyya-type bounds, that use higher-order derivatives of the log-likelihood. Precisely, the improved bounds in the latter case make explicit use of the elegant framework offered by employing the Faà di Bruno formula and exponential Bell polynomials in expressing the jets associated with the square root embedding in terms of the raw scores. The interplay between the geometry of the statistical embedding and the behavior of the estimator variance is quantitatively analyzed in concrete examples, showing that our corrections can meaningfully tighten the lower bound, suggesting further exploration into connections with estimator efficiency in more general situations.

Title:
Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type
Daniel Perniok
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT)
We propose a definition of Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type generalising the definition as a path algebra of a quiver. Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we explain how these Coxeter-Dynkin algebras illustrate the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems.

We develop an obstruction theory for the existence of gauge equivalences in complete differential graded Lie algebras. Specifically, this theory provides a characterization of homotopy equivalences between differential graded algebras governed by operads or properads, potentially colored in a groupoid. We apply this framework to establish new homotopy equivalence results in both algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, with a particular focus on the study of minimal models for highly connected varieties.

Scott-Vogelius element and iterated penalty method for inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions

Comments:
34 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present quasi-optimal a priori error estimates for general mixed finite element methods to approximate solutions of the Stokes problem subject to inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the Scott-Vogelius element this yields pressure-robust a priori error estimates. Due to the exact divergence constraint, this requires a compatibility condition for the boundary data to hold. A key tool is a modified Fortin operator, capable of preserving this compatibility condition. Furthermore, we analyse the iterated penalty method, a Uzawa-type algorithm and we show its convergence and asymptotic pressure robustness. Numerical experiments support the theory and highlight the importance of the compatibility condition and the appropriate treatment of nearly singular vertices.

The 3-strand braid group with torsion

In the 1950s, H. S. M. Coxeter considered the quotients of braid groups given by adding the relation that all half Dehn twist generators have some fixed, finite order. He found a remarkable formula for the order of these groups in terms of some related Platonic solids. Despite the inspiring apparent connection between these "truncated" braid groups and Platonic solids, Coxeter's proof boils down to a finite case check that reveals nothing about the structure present. We give a topological interpretation of the truncated 3-strand braid group that makes the connection with Platonic solids clear. One of our key tools is a formalism for orbifolds developed by A. Henriques that we think others would find interesting.

Entrywise preservers of sign regularity

Entrywise functions preserving positivity and related notions have a rich history, beginning with the seminal works of Schur, Pólya-Szegő, Schoenberg, and Rudin. Following their classical results, it is well-known that entrywise functions preserving positive semidefiniteness for matrices of all dimensions must be real analytic with non-negative Taylor coefficients. These works were taken forward in the last decade by Belton, Guillot, Khare, Putinar, and Rajaratnam. Recently, Belton-Guillot-Khare-Putinar [J. d'Analyse Math. 2023] classified all functions that entrywise preserve totally positive (TP) and totally non-negative (TN) matrices. In this paper, we study entrywise preservers of strictly sign regular and sign regular matrices - a class that includes TP/TN matrices as special cases and was first studied by Schoenberg in 1930 to characterize variation diminution. Our main results provide complete characterizations of entrywise transforms of rectangular matrices which preserve: (i)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity, as well as (ii)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity with a given sign pattern.

Monodromy representation of graphs

Subjects:

It is well-known that every vertex-transitive graph admits a representation as a coset graph. In this paper, we extend this construction by introducing monodromy graphs defined through double cosets. Our main result establishes that every graph is isomorphic to a monodromy graph, providing a new combinatorial framework for graph representation. Moreover, we show that every graph gives rise to an arc-transitive graph through its monodromy representation. Inspired by the monodromy representation of graphs, we denote an algebraic map $\mathcal{M}(G;\Omega,\rho,\tau)$ by $\mathcal{M}(G;U,\rho,\tau)$ where $U$ is a stabiliser in $G$. As an application, we prove an enumeration theorem for orientable maps with a given monodromy group. We underscore a fundamental triad in algebraic graph theory: Where there is a graph, there is a group, an arc-transitive graph, and an orientable regular map--each arising canonically from the underlying combinatorial and algebraic structures.

Fractal failures of Ratner rigidity in higher rank geometry

Ratner's theorem shows that in a locally symmetric space of noncompact type and finite volume, every immersed totally geodesic subspace of noncompact type is topologically rigid: its closure is an immersed submanifold.
We construct the first explicit higher-rank, infinite-volume examples in which this rigidity fails, via floating geodesic planes. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma<\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains a sequence of immersed floating geodesic planes with fractal closures whose Hausdorff dimensions, non-integral, accumulate at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
Our method uses Goldman's bulging deformations, but in higher rank new difficulties arise: unlike in rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane always diverge, here one must analyze the collective behavior of entire families of parallel geodesics inside flats under bulging, a phenomenon intrinsic to higher rank.

Construction of $d$-abelian categories via derived categories
Peter Jorgensen, Emre Sen
Comments:
33 pages
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT)
In this work, we provide a simple way to construct $d$-abelian categories via bounded derived categories for certain values of $d$. Namely, let ${\mathcal C}$ be an abelian category, and let ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ denote the full subcategory of the bounded derived category of ${\mathcal C}$ whose objects $X$ satisfy that $H_*(X)$ is concentrated in degrees $j$ where $0 \leq j \leq m$. We prove that if ${\mathcal C}$ is hereditary, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = 3m + 1$.
Beyond offering a uniform method for constructing $d$-abelian categories, this construction allows us to create $d$-abelian categories that exhibit some unexpected properties depending on the choice of the category ${\mathcal C}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of abelian groups, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category which is not $\mathbb{K}$-linear over a field $\mathbb{K}$ but has set indexed products and coproducts. Similarly, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of coherent sheaves over certain algebraic curves, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category without enough injectives.
We extend our results to $(n+2)$-angulated categories. Namely, let $M$ be an $n$-cluster tilting object over an $n$-representation finite algebra and let ${\mathcal T}$ be the corresponding $(n+2)$-angulated category with $n$-suspension functor $\Sigma_n$. We prove that the full subcategory ${\mathcal T}[0,m] = \mathrm{add} \bigoplus^{m}_{j=0}\Sigma^j_n M$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = (n+2)(m+1)-2$. Furthermore, we show that there is a bijection between the functorially finite wide subcategories of $\mathrm{add}\,M$ and the functorially finite repetitive wide subcategories of ${\mathcal T}[0,m]$.

The Hénon equation in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces

In this paper, we consider the Hénon problem in the setting of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta_g u= |x|^\alpha h( u) \quad \text{in }B\\ u>0 \quad \text{in }B\\ u= 0 \quad \text{on }\partial B\\ \end{cases} \end{equation*}where $B$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $g=G'$, $h=H'$ are N-functions and the operator $-\Delta_g$ is the $g$-Laplacian. We show that the symmetric term $|x|^\alpha$, for $\alpha>0$, allows to have radial solutions even for supercritical $H$, generalizing results for the classical Hénon equation. We also show that radial solutions are indeed bounded. Finally, we state a Pohozaev's identity in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces that we apply to get a range in $\alpha$ for which the problem has no bounded solutions.

Let $X$ be a normal projective variety admitting a polarized endomorphism $f$, i.e., $f^*H\sim qH$ for some ample divisor $H$ and integer $q>1$. Then Broustet and Gongyo proposed the conjecture that $X$ is of Calabi-Yau type (CY for short), i.e., $(X,\Delta)$ is lc for some effective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor $\Delta$ and $K_X+\Delta\sim_{\mathbb{Q}}0$. We prove the conjecture when $X$ is a Gorenstein terminal 3-fold, extending the result of Sheng Meng for smooth threefolds. We then study the singularity type and CY property for $(X,\Delta+\frac{R_{\Delta}}{q-1})$ when $(X,\Delta)$ is an $f$-pair, i.e., $K_X+\Delta=f^*(K_X+\Delta)+R_\Delta$ with $\Delta, R_{\Delta}$ being effective. In particular, we show: (1) $K_X + \frac{R_f}{q-1}$ is $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier and numerically trivial when $X$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial (or of klt type) $3$-fold; (2) $(X, \frac{R_{f}}{q-1})$ is log Calabi-Yau when $X$ is a surface with the Picard number $\rho(X)>1$ or $f^{-s}(P)=P$ for some prime divisor $P$ and $s>0$.

A converse theorem for hyperbolic surface spectra and the conformal bootstrap

Subjects:
Spectral Theory (math.SP); Number Theory (math.NT); Representation Theory (math.RT)
The conformal bootstrap in physics has recently been adapted to prove remarkably sharp estimates on Laplace eigenvalues and triple correlations of automorphic forms on compact hyperbolic surfaces. These estimates derive from an infinite family of algebraic equations satisfied by this spectral data. The equations encode $G$-equivariance and associativity of multiplication on $\Gamma \backslash G$, for $\Gamma$ a cocompact lattice in $G = \text{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. The effectiveness of the conformal bootstrap suggests that the equations characterize hyperbolic surface spectra, i.e., that every solution to the equations comes from a compact hyperbolic surface. This paper proves this rigorously with no analytic assumptions on the solution except discreteness of the spectrum. The key intermediate result is an axiomatic characterization of representations of $G$ of the form $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.

In this paper, we consider Hecke triangle groups $\Gamma_w$ for $w>2$ and associated infinite-volume orbifolds $\Gamma_w \backslash \mathbb{H}$. We show that the Selberg zeta function $Z_{\Gamma_w}(s)$ can be approximated for $s \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \frac{1}{2}(1-2 \mathbb{N}_0)$ by determinants of finite-dimensional matrices with an explicitly computed error term that decays exponentially as the matrix size increases. As an application, we evaluate the Hausdorff dimensions of Hecke triangle groups with high precision, explicitly compute the values of the corresponding Ruelle zeta functions at zero, and obtain estimates on orders of trivial zeroes of the Selberg zeta function.

In search of maximal branes on hyper-Kähler manifolds

Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Given a holomorphic or anti-holomorphic involution on a complex variety, the Smith inequality says that the total $\mathbb{F}_2$-Betti number of the fixed locus is no greater than the total $\mathbb{F}_2$-Betti number of the ambient variety. The involution is called maximal when the equality is achieved. In this paper, we investigate the existence problem for maximal involutions on higher-dimensional compact hyper-Kähler manifolds and on Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces.
We show that for $n\geq 2$, a hyper-Kähler manifold of K3$^{[n]}$-deformation type admits neither maximal anti-holomoprhic involutions (i.e. real structures), nor maximal holomorphic (symplectic or anti-symplectic) involutions. In other words, such hyper-Kähler manifolds do not contain maximal (AAB), (ABA), (BAA) or (BBB)-branes.
For Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces, we show that for a holomorphic (resp. anti-holomorphic) involution $\sigma$ on a smooth projective surface $S$ with $H^1(S, \mathbb{F}_2)=0$, the naturally induced involution on the $n$th Hilbert scheme of points is maximal if and only if $\sigma$ is a maximal involution of $S$ and it acts on $H^2(S, \mathbb{Z})$ trivially (resp. as $-\operatorname{id}$). This generalizes previous results of Fu and Kharlamov-Răsdeaconu.

Local Characterization of Noise in Iterative Reconstruction of the Generalized Radon Transform
Alexander Katsevich
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We study noise in iterative reconstruction from discrete noisy data of a generalized Radon transform in the plane. Our approach builds on Local Reconstruction Analysis (LRA), a framework for analyzing reconstructions at the native scale. We establish that the rescaled reconstruction error converges in distribution to a zero-mean Gaussian random field with explicitly computable covariance, providing a complete local characterization of noise in iterative reconstruction. Numerical experiments show strong agreement with the theoretical predictions. Combined with earlier deterministic results, our findings complete the analysis of iterative reconstruction at the native scale with respect to the two most fundamental limitations: the discreteness of the data and the presence of noise.

We show when and in how many lines of ${\mathcal G}_{k}(V)$ they are contained. Next we prove that $\langle U]^{\Pi}_{k}$ is a maximal clique of $\Pi[n,k]_q$ exactly if it

An adaptive Hermite spectral method for the Boltzmann equation
Sihong Shao, Yanli Wang, Jie Wu
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We propose an adaptive Hermite spectral method for the three-dimensional velocity space of the Boltzmann equation guided by a newly developed frequency indicator. For the homogeneous problem, the indicator is defined by the contribution of high-order coefficients in the spectral expansion. For the non-homogeneous problem, a Fourier-Hermite scheme is employed, with the corresponding frequency indicator formulated based on distributions across the entire spatial domain. The adaptive Hermite method includes scaling and p-adaptive techniques to dynamically adjust the scaling factor and expansion order according to the indicator. Numerical experiments cover both homogeneous and non-homogeneous problems in up to three spatial dimensions. Results demonstrate that the scaling adaptive method substantially reduces L2 errors at negligible computational cost, and the p-adaptive method achieves time savings of up to 74%.

Rational methods are intended to time integrate linear homogeneous problems. However, their scope can be extended so as to cover linear nonhomogeneous problems.

Some numerical illustrations are included showing the predicted behaviour of the proposed methods.

We study points and 0-cycles on del Pezzo surfaces defined over a field K of characteristic 0, with emphasis on cubic surfaces. We prove that a cubic surface that admits a point defined over a field extension of K of degree coprime to 3 either has a K-point or has a point defined over a field extension of degree 4. This improves a result of Coray (who allowed also field extensions of degree 10). We also prove that 0-cycles of degree at least 18 on a cubic surface are effective and get similar results for degree 2 and degree 1 del Pezzo surfaces, improving results of Colliot-Thélène. In a different direction, we prove that the third symmetric product of a cubic hypersurface of dimension at least 2 is unirational over any field, and that it is not stably rational in general (over a non-algebraically closed field).

Our findings contribute insights into the interplay between intrinsic frequency diversity and synchronization dynamics, offering a more realistic understanding of complex systems. The proposed framework has broad applications ranging from coupled oscillators in physics to social dynamics, and serves as a valuable tool for studying networks with distributed intrinsic frequencies.

Colour-biased Hamilton cycles in dense graphs and random graphs
Natalie Behague, Debsoumya Chakraborti, Jared León
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A classical result of Dirac says that every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\frac{n}{2}$ contains a Hamilton cycle. A `discrepancy' version of Dirac's theorem was shown by Balogh--Csaba--Jing--Pluhár, Freschi--Hyde--Lada--Treglown, and Gishboliner--Krivelevich--Michaeli as follows. Every $r$-colouring of the edge set of every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2r} + o(1))n$ contains a Hamilton cycle where one of the colours appears at least $(1+o(1))\frac{n}{r}$ times. In this paper, we generalize this result by asymptotically determining the maximum possible value $f_{r,\alpha}(n)$ for every $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ such that every $r$-colouring of the edge set of every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ contains a Hamilton cycle where one of the colours appears at least $f_{r,\alpha}(n)$ times. In particular, we show that $f_{r,\alpha}(n) = (1-o(1)) \min\{(2\alpha - 1)n, \frac{2\alpha n}{r}, \frac{2n}{r+1}\}$ for every $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2r}, 1]$.
A graph $H$ is called an $\alpha$-residual subgraph of a graph $G$ if $d_H(v)\ge \alpha d_{G[V(H)]}(v)$ for every $v\in V(H)$. Extending Dirac's theorem in the setting of random graphs, Lee and Sudakov showed the following. The Erdős--Rényi random graph $G(n,p)$, with $p$ above the Hamiltonicity threshold, typically has the property that every $(\frac{1}{2} +o(1))$-residual spanning subgraph contains a Hamilton cycle. Motivated by this, we prove the following random version of our `discrepancy' result. The random graph $G \sim G(n,p)$, with $p$ above the Hamiltonicity threshold, typically satisfies that every $r$-colouring of the edge set of every $\alpha$-residual spanning subgraph of $G$ contains a Hamilton cycle where one of the colours appears at least $f_{r,\alpha}(n)$ times.

One can see deep-learning models as compositions of functions within the so-called tame geometry. In this expository note, we give an overview of some topics at the interface of tame geometry (also known as o-minimality), optimization theory, and deep learning theory and practice. To do so, we gradually introduce the concepts and tools used to build convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent in a general nonsmooth nonconvex, but tame, setting. This illustrates some ways in which tame geometry is a natural mathematical framework for the study of AI systems, especially within Deep Learning.

We establish an inequality relating the surface gravity and topology of a horizon in a $3$-dimensional asymptotically locally hyperbolic static space with the geometry at infinity. Equality is achieved only by the Kottler black holes, and this rigidity leads to several new static black hole uniqueness theorems for a negative cosmological constant. First, the ADS-Schwarzschild black hole with critical surface gravity $\kappa=\sqrt{-\Lambda}$ is unique. Second, the toroidal Kottler black holes are unique in the absence of spherical horizons. Third, the hyperbolic Kottler black holes with mass $m>0$ are unique *if* the generalized Penrose inequality holds for the corresponding class of static spaces. Building on work of Ge-Wang-Wu-Xia, we then use this fact to obtain uniqueness for static ALH graphs with hyperbolic infinities.
This inequality follows from a generalization of the Minkowski inequality in ADS-Schwarzschild space due to Brendle-Hung-Wang. Using optimal coefficients for the sub-static Heintze-Karcher inequality, we construct a new monotone quantity under inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in static spaces with ${\Lambda} < 0$. Another fundamental tool developed in this paper is a regularity theorem for IMCF in asymptotically locally hyperbolic manifolds. Specifically, we prove that a weak solution of IMCF in an ALH 3-manifold with horizon boundary is eventually smooth. This extends the regularity theorem for a spherical infinity due to Shi and Zhu.

Matricial ranges, dilations, and unital contractive maps

Let $J_n$ be the Jordan block of size $n$ with all eigen values zero. Arveson introduced the notion of the matricial range of an operator in his remarkable article called Subalgebras of $C^*$-algebras II (Acta Math, 128, 1972) and established that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by $J_2$ is completely positive. This describes the matricial range of $J_2$ as the set of all matrices with numerical radius at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Later, Choi and Li generalize this result of Arveson and prove that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by any $2\times 2$ matrix or any $3\times3$ matrix with a reducing subspace is completely positive. After fifty years of the above result of Arveson, the matricial range of $J_n$ for $n\geq 3$ has not been characterized. This article aims to investigate this long-standing open problem for $n=3$. We begin by establishing a structure theorem for a dilation of an operator $B$ satisfying $BB^*+B^*B=I$ and then investigate whether every $B\in\mathbb{M}_n$ satisfying $BB^*+B^*B\leq I_n$ admits a dilation $\widetilde{B}$ for which $\widetilde{B}\widetilde{B}^*+\widetilde{B}^*\widetilde{B}=I$. This study plays the central role to the development of this paper. We use this to prove that every unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $J_3$ is $2$-positive and obtain some partial results towards characterizing the matricial range of $J_3$. Next, we study unital contractive maps on operator systems generated by $4\times 4$ normal matrices, and show that this is equivalent to studying a unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $T=\text{diag}(\lambda,-1,i,-i)$, where $\Re{(\lambda)}\geq 0$. We prove that every unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $T=\text{diag}(1,-1,i,-i)$ is completely positive.

Operator Algebras (math.OA)
We study no-signalling correlations over Cantor spaces, placing the product of infinitely many copies of a finite non-local game in a unified general setup. We define the subclasses of local, quantum spatial, approximately quantum and quantum commuting Cantor correlations and describe them in terms of states on tensor products of inductive limits of operator systems. We provide a correspondence between no-signalling (resp. approximately quantum, quantum commuting) Cantor correlations and sequences of correlations of the same type over the projections onto increasing number of finitely many coordinates. We introduce Cantor games, and associate canonically such a game to a sequence of finite input/output games, showing that the numerical sequence of the values of the games in the sequence converges to the corresponding value of the compound Cantor game.

Density convergence on Markov diffusion chaos via Stein's method
Thanh Dang, Yaozhong Hu
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study the difference between the probability density of a random variable $F$ on Markov diffusion chaos and the probability density of a general target distribution $Z$. In the special case where $F$ is a chaotic random variables and $Z$ is a Pearson target, we extend our study to the $k$-th derivatives of the densities for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$. In particular, we obtain four moment theorems for the convergence of the $k$-th derivatives of the densities of $F$ to the corresponding $k$-th derivatives of the density of a Pearson target. Our work therefore significantly extends earlier works [HLN14,BDH24] which studies density convergence of random variables on Wiener chaos to respectively the normal and Gamma targets.
We provide two applications of our results. The first application is about weighted sum of i.i.d. Gamma distribution where we show convergence in laws of this weighted sum to another Gamma distribution automatically implies convergence in densities. In the second application, we show that for a large class of Pearson diffusions, the density of its solution with any initial condition exponentially converge to its limiting density. Moreover, this exponential convergence holds for the $k$-th derivatives of the densities for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.

Rees algebras of complementary edge ideals

Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper we investigate the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals $I \subset S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ generated in degree $n-2$, where $K$ is a field. Every such ideal arises as the complementary edge ideal $I_c(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the defining equations of the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ in terms of the combinatorics of $G$. When $G$ is a bipartite or a connected unicyclic graph, we show that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is a normal Cohen-Macaulay domain. If $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph whose unique induced cycle has length $3$ or $4$, we further prove that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is Koszul. We also determine the asymptotic depth of the powers of $I_c(G)$, proving that $\lim_{k \to \infty}\text{depth}\, S/I_c(G)^k=b(G)$, where $b(G)$ is the number of bipartite connected components of $G$. Finally, we show that the index of depth stability of $I_c(G)$ is at most $n-2$, and equality holds when $G$ is a path graph.

The aim of these notes is to give an overview of several aspects of what has come to be called the relative Langlands program, a theme that takes its origin in the study of automorphic periods and their relations to particular cases of Langlands functoriality and special values of (automorphic) $L$-functions. Following the work of Sakellaridis and Sakellaridis-Venkatesh, we emphasize the unifying role played by spherical varieties and harmonic analysis on them. We also review various instances of the phenomena, discovered by Jacquet, Gan-Gross-Prasad, Ichino-Ikeda and many others, that motivated these developments.

Long-wave instability of periodic shear flows for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In 1959, Kolmogorov proposed to study the instability of the shear flow $(\sin(y),0)$ in the vanishing viscosity regime in tori $\mathbb{T}_{\alpha}\times \mathbb{T}$. This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} > \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.

Pareto-Optimal Linear Programming

Subjects:

Pareto-optimality plays a central role in evaluating the efficiency of solutions to allocation problems, such as house allocation, school choice, and kidney exchange. We introduce a general linear programming problem subject to Pareto-optimality conditions, which we call Max-Pareto. Using the novel result that Pareto-optimal bipartite matchings are fractionally Pareto-optimal, we prove that Max-Pareto is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete. We propose a bilinear programming formulation of Max-Pareto, and evaluate its computational performance on the problem of finding Pareto-optimal allocations of highest welfare.

Optimal Sizing of Community Photovoltaic and Battery Energy Storage Systems with Second-Life Batteries in Peer-to-Peer Energy Communities
Júlia Monar, Fernando García-Muñoz, Natalia Jorquera Bravo, Joaquín Aballay Araya, Vicente Castro Burgos
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This article presents a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model to determine the optimal sizing of a community-shared photovoltaic and battery energy storage system (PV-BESS) within a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework. The model accounts for heterogeneous users who may already own individual PV or PV-BESS systems and aims to enhance the overall energy autonomy of the energy community. A key feature of the model is the explicit comparison between first-life (FL) and second-life (SL) battery technologies, incorporating their respective degradation dynamics into investment and operational decisions, and the technical feasibility by considering constraints of a low-voltage distribution network. The proposed formulation is tested on the reduced equivalent of the IEEE European low-voltage network. Results show that the most influential factors in the adoption of a shared BESS are: (i) the market cost of battery technologies, (ii) electricity tariffs, particularly purchase prices, and (iii) the degradation characteristics of the chosen technology. Secondary factors, such as DER penetration among users and the community's peak demand, have a lesser impact. The analysis further suggests that SL batteries could become a cost-effective alternative to FL technologies if their degradation performance improves or their capital cost is significantly reduced.

Reconstructing Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Traffic Flow Modeling: a Multi-Gradient Descent and Pareto Learning Approach

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem, treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods. Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.

Monitoring Time Series for Relevant Changes
Patrick Bastian, Tim Kutta, Rupsa Basu, Holger Dette
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We consider the problem of sequentially testing for changes in the mean parameter of a time series, compared to a benchmark period. Most tests in the literature focus on the null hypothesis of a constant mean versus the alternative of a single change at an unknown time. Yet in many applications it is unrealistic that no change occurs at all, or that after one change the time series remains stationary forever. We introduce a new setup, modeling the sequence of means as a piecewise constant function with arbitrarily many changes. Instead of testing for a change, we ask whether the evolving sequence of means, say $(\mu_n)_{n \geq 1}$, stays within a narrow corridor around its initial value, that is, $\mu_n \in [\mu_1-\Delta, \mu_1+\Delta]$ for all $n \ge 1$. Combining elements from multiple change point detection with a Hölder-type monitoring procedure, we develop a new online monitoring tool. A key challenge in both construction and proof of validity is that the risk of committing a type-I error after any time $n$ fundamentally depends on the unknown future of the time series. Simulations support our theoretical results and we present two real-world applications: (1) healthcare monitoring, with a focus on blood glucose tracking, and (2) political consensus analysis via citizen opinion polls.

Predictive Machine Learning to Increase the Throughput of Container Yards

Subjects:

This study seeks to improve the throughput rates for shipping container terminals. In the United States, shipping ports link the domestic economy to global markets and are vital to sustain supply chain flow and economic stability. Maritime shipping accounts for nearly half of the U.S.'s annual international trade, two thirds of which are represented by container shipping. Previous studies highlighted the capability of automation in enhancing container processing; however, unlike in European and East Asian ports, full automation is limited in U.S. ports due to legal protections for human labor. Consequently, there is a need for alternative methods that deliver automation level efficiencies while maintaining the terms of cooperative agreements. This paper proposes an Intelligent Planning System (IPS) that applies the concept of Pareto Optimization to container yards through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based recursive appointment system. The results show an improvement from baseline for both daily terminal throughput volumes and processing times. The generated IPS can be employed to provide recommendations for container positioning and truck pickup appointments to optimize container yard layout and flow resulting in reduced realtime congestion and predictively mitigated future congestion.

This book is devoted to an informal discussion of patterns constructed for treating physical problems. Such patterns, when sufficiently formalized, are usually referred as "models", and tents to be applied not only in physics, but conquer the fields traditionally occupied by other disciplines generally considered to be different from physics. The author calls this unification of seemingly disjoint results a "physmatical effect" - pointing to the fact that multitudes of fine - grained physics-based mathematical models become inextricably linked and networked. Mathematics serves as a key code gluing together isolated physical models viewed as nodes of this network.

Hypergeometry from $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-Symmetry: Feynman Integrals in One and Two Dimensions

Feynman integrals with generic propagator powers in one and two spacetime dimensions are investigated from various perspectives. In particular, we argue that the class of track integrals at any loop order is fixed by the recently found $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of Yangian type. All track integrals up to six external points (and four loops) are bootstrapped explicitly as well as the full family of one-loop integrals at any multiplicity. Moreover, the triangle tracks at generic loop order, which constitute the most generic family of track-type integrals, are bootstrapped in this way. The results are compared to the direct evaluation via a `spectral transform' from the integrability toolbox that turns out to be particularly efficient for position-space tree integrals in lower dimensions. We prove that all $\mathrm{\widehat P}$-symmetries of these integrals can be derived from the framework of Aomoto--Gelfand hypergeometric functions, which applies to integrals in one and two dimensions. Finally, we also demonstrate the method's applicability to conformal integrals by deriving the complete results for all comb-channel conformal partial waves as well as the conformal double-box integral. We explicitly go through all examples of the above integrals in 1D and then provide a straightforward recipe for how to read off their 2D counterparts.

Classical communication over a quantum multiple access channel (MAC) is considered. Since the no-cloning prohibits universal copying of arbitrary quantum states, classical feedback is generated through measurement. An achievable rate region is derived using superposition block Markov coding and a quantum multiparty lemma for the analysis. Our region generalizes both the classical Cover-Leung region and the generalized feedback region. As an example, we show that the quantum binary adder MAC can benefit from feedback.

Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Applications (stat.AP); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Multi-centre studies increasingly rely on distributed inference, where sites share only centre-level summaries. Homogeneity of parameters across centres is often violated, motivating methods that both \emph{test} for equality and \emph{learn} centre groupings before estimation. We develop multivariate Cochran-type tests that operate on summary statistics and embed them in a sequential, test-driven \emph{Clusters-of-Centres (CoC)} algorithm that merges centres (or blocks) only when equality is not rejected. We derive the asymptotic $\chi^2$-mixture distributions of the test statistics and provide plug-in estimators for implementation. To improve finite-sample integration, we introduce a multi-round bootstrap CoC that re-evaluates merges across independently resampled summary sets; under mild regularity and a separation condition, we prove a \emph{golden-partition recovery} result: as the number of rounds grows with $n$, the true partition is recovered with probability tending to one. We also give simple numerical guidelines, including a plateau-based stopping rule, to make the multi-round procedure reproducible. Simulations and a real-data analysis of U.S.\ airline on-time performance (2007) show accurate heterogeneity detection and partitions that change little with the choice of resampling scheme.

Quantum entanglement is an important phenomenon in quantum information theory. To detect entanglement theoretically, positive but not completely positive maps are used. The Kadison-Schwarz (KS) inequality interpolates between positivity and complete positivity. KS maps may be key to understanding and detecting entanglement. We provide a description of a subset of KS maps on $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ that are unital. This allows for the classification of a wider class of positive maps than the well known bistochastic maps. We derive the conditions for a unital map to be a KS map, and provide non-trivial examples of such a map.

"It Was a Magical Box": Understanding Practitioner Workflows and Needs in Optimization

Subjects:
Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Optimization underpins decision-making in domains from healthcare to logistics, yet for many practitioners it remains a "magical box": powerful but opaque, difficult to use, and reliant on specialized expertise. While prior work has extensively studied machine learning workflows, the everyday practices of optimization model developers (OMDs) have received little attention. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 OMDs across diverse domains to examine how optimization is done in practice. Our findings reveal a highly iterative workflow spanning six stages: problem elicitation, data processing, model development, implementation, validation, and deployment. Importantly, we find that optimization practice is not only about algorithms that deliver better decisions, but is equally shaped by data and dialogue - the ongoing communication with stakeholders that enables problem framing, trust, and adoption. We discuss opportunities for future tooling that foregrounds data and dialogue alongside decision-making, opening new directions for human-centered optimization.

Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA) Vectors can Identify Reticulation Events even in Multifurcated Trees

Recently, a new vector encoding, Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA), was introduced that represents $n$-leaf phylogenetic trees as $n-1$ length integer vectors by recording the placement location of each leaf. Both encoding and decoding of trees run in linear time and depend on a fixed ordering of the leaves. Here, we investigate the connection between OLA vectors and the maximum acyclic agreement forest (MAAF) problem. A MAAF represents an optimal breakdown of $k$ trees into reticulation-free subtrees, with the roots of these subtrees representing reticulation events. We introduce a corrected OLA distance index over OLA vectors of $k$ trees, which is easily computable in linear time. We prove that the corrected OLA distance corresponds to the size of a MAAF, given an optimal leaf ordering that minimizes that distance. Additionally, a MAAF can be easily reconstructed from optimal OLA vectors. We expand these results to multifurcated trees: we introduce an $O(kn \cdot m\log m)$ algorithm that optimally resolves a set of multifurcated trees given a leaf-ordering, where $m$ is the size of a largest multifurcation, and show that trees resolved via this algorithm also minimize the size of a MAAF. These results suggest a new approach to fast computation of phylogenetic networks and identification of reticulation events via random permutations of leaves. Additionally, in the case of microbial evolution, a natural ordering of leaves is often given by the sample collection date, which means that under mild assumptions, reticulation events can be identified in polynomial time on such datasets.

Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.

Quantum Algorithms for Solving Generalized Linear Systems via Momentum Accelerated Gradient and Schrödingerization

Comments:
30 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that combines the momentum accelerated gradient method with Schrödingerization [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], achieving polynomial speedup over its classical counterpark in solving linear systems. The algorithm achieves a query complexity of the same order as the Schrödingerization based damped dynamical system method, namely, linear dependence on the condition number of the matrix, and can overcome the practical limitations of existing non-Schrödingerization-based quantum linear system algorithms. These limitations stem from their reliance on techniques such as VTAA and RM, which introduce substantial quantum hardware resource overhead. Furthermore, it demonstrates both theoretically and experimentally that the auxiliary variables introduced by our method do not dominate the error reduction at any point, thereby preventing a significant increase in the actual evolution time compared to the theoretical prediction. In contrast, the damped method fails to meet this criterion. This gives new perspectives for quantum algorithms for linear systems, establishing a novel analytical framework for algorithms with broader applicability, faster convergence rates, and superior solution quality.

Subspace tracking is a fundamental problem in signal processing, where the goal is to estimate and track the underlying subspace that spans a sequence of data streams over time. In high-dimensional settings, data samples are often corrupted by non-Gaussian noises and may exhibit sparsity. This paper explores the alpha divergence for sparse subspace estimation and tracking, offering robustness to data corruption. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art robust subspace tracking methods while achieving a low computational complexity and memory storage. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness in robust subspace tracking and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation.

Ensuring both optimality and safety is critical for the real-world deployment of agents, but becomes particularly challenging when the system dynamics are unknown. To address this problem, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning via sufficient exploration in the space of safe policies. We propose a $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe framework that $\textit{optimistically}$ explores informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.

Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) enable high spatial resolution and multiplexing, especially for user equipments (UEs) in the radiative near-field. To reduce hardware cost, modular ELAA architectures with distributed baseband units (BBUs) are gaining traction. This paper addresses near-field line-of-sight (LOS) channel estimation under low noise amplifier (LNA)-induced hardware impairments in such modular systems. We propose computationally efficient estimators that exploit the array geometry and constant-modulus structure of near-field LOS channels, including a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) masking technique that improves estimation accuracy and significantly reduces fronthaul signaling. Numerical results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the conventional least squares (LS) method.

6DMA-Assisted Secure Wireless Communications

Systems and Control (eess.SY); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been widely studied for capacity enhancement, but its potential for physical layer security (PLS) remains largely unexplored. By adjusting both three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces, 6DMA can increase spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The extra DoFs enable dynamic shaping of legitimate channels and suppresses eavesdropping channels, thereby offering unique advantages in enhancing secrecy performance. Motivated by this, this letter proposes a novel 6DMA-assisted secure wireless communication system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with 6DMA to enhance secrecy performance. Specifically, to simultaneously serve multiple legitimate users and counter cooperative interception by multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum secrecy rate (SSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit and artificial noise (AN) beamformers, as well as the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems and solves them iteratively to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior secrecy performance over partially movable and conventional fixed-position antenna systems.

The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model on a one-dimensional lattice: Analytical wave functions of topological edge states

The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a prototype model in the field of topological condensed matter physics, and the existence and characteristics of its topological edge states are crucial for revealing the topological essence of low-dimensional systems. This paper focuses on the analytical wave functions of topological edge states in the SSH model, systematically sorting out the fundamentals of model construction. Based on the tight-binding approximation, it derives the matrix form of the SSH model Hamiltonian and the band structureand clarifies the role of chiral symmetry in the classification of topological phases. By solving the Schrodinger equation of the finite-length lattice, the mathematical expression of the analytical wave function of topological edge states is fully derived, verifying its localized feature of exponential decay. Moreover, it quantitatively analyzes the influence laws of lattice parameters (hopping integrals, lattice constants), electron-electron interactions, and external field perturbations on the wave function amplitude, decay coefficient, and energy. Furthermore, it establishes the quantitative correlation between the analytical wave function and electronic transport (conductivity) as well as optical properties (light absorption coefficient), and discusses its application prospects in the design of topological qubits and the development of new topological materials. The research results provide theoretical support for an in-depth understanding of the physical essence of low-dimensional topological states and lay a foundation for the performance optimization of topology-related devices.

Emerging Technologies (cs.ET); Information Theory (cs.IT)
6G wireless communication networks are expected to use extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) to support higher throughput, massive connectivity, and improved system performance. ELAAs would fundamentally alter wave characteristics, transforming them from plane waves into spherical waves, thereby operating in the near field. Near-field communications (NFC) offer unique advantages to enhance system performance, but also present significant challenges in channel modeling, computational complexity, and beamforming design. The use of machine learning (ML) is emerging as a powerful approach to tackle such challenges and has the capabilities to enable intelligent, secure, and efficient 6G wireless communications. In this survey, we discuss ML-driven approaches for NFC. We first outline the fundamental concepts of NFC and ML. We then discuss ML applications in channel estimation, beamforming design, and security enhancement. We also highlight key challenges (e.g., data privacy and computational overhead). Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions to emphasize the role of advanced ML techniques in near-field system design.

Dynamics of Interacting Murnaghan-Equation-of-State Fluids with Global Monopole and Nonlinear Power-Yang-Mills Hair in Critical-Dimension AdS Black Holes

We construct and analyze a novel family of exact higher-dimensional black hole solutions in Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field multiplet supporting a global monopole and a surrounding anisotropic ''scalar gas'' whose stress-energy obeys a generalized Murnaghan equation of state. By adopting the Wu-Yang magnetic ansatz for the non-Abelian sector and enforcing the physically motivated radial condition $p_r=-\rho$, the field equations admit closed-form expressions for the matter density and a single-function lapse $F(r)$ expressed in terms of elementary and Gauss hypergeometric functions. The Murnaghan fluid interpolates between a non-linear core and an effective vacuum at a large radius, producing a backreaction encoded by parameters that control the stiffness and scalar-backreaction scale. We perform a systematic survey of classical energy condition, identifying regions of parameter space where the null energy condition/dominant energy condition holds while the strong energy condition is generically violated (phantom-like behavior), and examine curvature invariants to demonstrate that the solutions possess a central curvature singularity for $n>3$. Thermodynamic properties are derived in the extended phase space: explicit formulas for the Hawking temperature, entropy, conjugate potentials, and a generalized Smarr relation are obtained; the heat capacity exhibits divergencies and sign changes that mark local stability boundaries and second-order phase transitions. Varying the Yang-Mills charge, the nonlinearity index, the monopole coupling, and the Murnaghan parameters generates a rich phase behavior structure and topology changes in the defect ($\varphi$-Duan) map. The results underscore the manner in which gauge nonlinearity, topological defects, and dual-polytropic matter collaboratively transform BH thermodynamics and the topology of phase spaces.

Twists of four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories (SQFTs) isolate protected sectors with rich algebraic structures. We develop a unified framework for analyzing symmetries and anomalies in four-dimensional holomorphically twisted SQFTs, combiningcomplex-geometric and algebraic perspectives. This approach clarifies the connections between existing formulations in the literature and resolves several open questions left unanswered in the first installment of this series.
We place particular emphasis on theories with extended supersymmetry, where the holomorphic twist gives rise to enhanced algebraic and geometric structures. We explain how these features emerge and govern the organization of the twisted theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a superconformal deformation of the twisted theory naturally leads to the associated vertex operator algebra, clarifying how the higher algebraic structures of the holomorphically twisted theory give rise to vertex algebras structures.

$Δ_T$ Noise as a Robust Diagnostic for Chiral, Helical and Trivial Edge Modes

In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive, practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature, finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.

We propose iZoSGA, a data-driven learning algorithm for joint passive long-term intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-aided beamforming and active short-term precoding in wireless networks. iZoSGA is based on a zeroth-order stochastic quasigradient ascent methodology designed for tackling two-stage nonconvex stochastic programs with continuous uncertainty and objective functions with "black-box" terms, and where second-stage optimization is inexact. As such, iZoSGA utilizes inexact precoding oracles, enabling practical implementation when short-term (e.g., WMMSE-based) beamforming is solved approximately. The proposed method is agnostic to channel models or statistics, and applies to arbitrary IRS/network configurations. We prove non-asymptotic convergence of iZoSGA to a neighborhood of a stationary solution of the original exact problem under minimal assumptions. Our numerics confirm the efficacy iZoSGA in several "inexact regimes", enabling passive yet fully effective IRS operation in diverse and realistic IRS-aided scenarios.

Graph polynomials encode fundamental combinatorial invariants of graphs. Their computation is investigated using tree and path decomposition frameworks, with formal definitions of treewidth, k-trees, and pathwidth establishing the structural basis for algorithmic efficiency. Explicit algorithms are constructed for each polynomial, leveraging decomposition order and state transformation mappings to enable tractable computation on graphs of bounded treewidth. Python implementations validate the methods, and computational complexity is analyzed with respect to sparse and k-degenerate graph classes. These results advance decomposition-based approaches for polynomial computation in algebraic graph theory.

Quantum State Tomography for Tensor Networks in Two Dimensions
Zhen Qin, Zhihui Zhu
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.

The Complexity of Finding Local Optima in Contrastive Learning

Contrastive learning is a powerful technique for discovering meaningful data representations by optimizing objectives based on $\textit{contrastive information}$, often given as a set of weighted triplets $\{(x_i, y_i^+, z_{i}^-)\}_{i = 1}^m$ indicating that an "anchor" $x_i$ is more similar to a "positive" example $y_i$ than to a "negative" example $z_i$. The goal is to find representations (e.g., embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or a tree metric) where anchors are placed closer to positive than to negative examples. While finding $\textit{global}$ optima of contrastive objectives is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard, the complexity of finding $\textit{local}$ optima -- representations that do not improve by local search algorithms such as gradient-based methods -- remains open. Our work settles the complexity of finding local optima in various contrastive learning problems by proving $\mathsf{PLS}$-hardness in discrete settings (e.g., maximize satisfied triplets) and $\mathsf{CLS}$-hardness in continuous settings (e.g., minimize Triplet Loss), where $\mathsf{PLS}$ (Polynomial Local Search) and $\mathsf{CLS}$ (Continuous Local Search) are well-studied complexity classes capturing local search dynamics in discrete and continuous optimization, respectively. Our results imply that no polynomial time algorithm (local search or otherwise) can find a local optimum for various contrastive learning problems, unless $\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$ for continuous problems). Even in the unlikely scenario that $\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$), our reductions imply that there exist instances where local search algorithms need exponential time to reach a local optimum, even for $d=1$ (embeddings on a line).

Underground lifelines, such as pipelines and tunnels, are susceptible to ground vibrations from seismic events, traffic, and other dynamic sources. Accurate prediction of their response is essential for ensuring structural safety and operability. This study introduces a semi-analytical model for transverse vibration analysis of buried lifelines, formulated using the Timoshenko beam theory on elastic foundation. The closed-form analytical solutions revealed that the vibration spectrum comprises four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. At each transition, the oscillatory characteristics of the modes change as a function of the system properties, leading to marked variations in dynamic amplification. The model's validity is confirmed through case studies of buried steel pipelines of varying lengths and operating conditions, showing excellent agreement with finite element simulations. A subsequent parametric study quantifies the influence of key factors - including soil stiffness and system length - on dynamic performance. The proposed method provides a computationally efficient and physically transparent framework for capturing complex vibration phenomena beyond simplified travelling-wave approaches, offering valuable guidance for the design and resilience assessment of underground lifeline systems subjected to various dynamic loads.

The problem of interpolating a rigid body motion is to find a spatial trajectory between a prescribed initial and terminal pose. Two variants of this interpolation problem are addressed. The first is to find a solution that satisfies initial conditions on the k-1 derivatives of the rigid body twist. This is called the kth-order initial value trajectory interpolation problem (k-IV-TIP). The second is to find a solution that satisfies conditions on the rigid body twist and its k-1 derivatives at the initial and terminal pose. This is called the kth-order boundary value trajectory interpolation problem (k-BV-TIP). Solutions to the k-IV-TIP for k=1,...,4, i.e. the initial twist and up to the 4th time derivative are prescribed. Further, a solution to the 1-IV-TBP is presented, i.e. the initial and terminal twist are prescribed. The latter is a novel cubic interpolation between two spatial configurations with given initial and terminal twist. This interpolation is automatically identical to the minimum acceleration curve when the twists are set to zero. The general approach to derive higher-order solutions is presented. Numerical results are shown for two examples.

We discuss the Cahill-Glauber (CG) $s$-parameterized representation, a framework in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. We present the differential form of the hatted star product $\mathbin{\widehat{\star}_s}$, which emerges when we consider the inverse Cahill-Glauber (iCG) transform of a product of phase space functions. It appears to be the Hilbert space mirror of the usual star product $\mathbin{\star_s}$, and supports the interpretation of classical mechanics as the irreducible deformation of quantum mechanics by decoherence. Additionally, alternative forms of the evaluation of $\mathbin{\star_s}$ and $\mathbin{\widehat{\star}_s}$ are considered.

The main aim of this work is to present an explicit construction of a 2-design of ${\rm U}(2)$, relying only on a tool that belongs to every physicists toolbox: the theory of angular momentum. Unitary designs are a rich and fundamental mathematical topic, with numerous fruitful applications in quantum information science and technology. In this work we take a peek under the hood. We begin with a minimal set of definitions and characterizations. Then we derive all 1-designs of ${\rm U}(2)$ of minimum size. Finally, we set out, step by step, a completion procedure extending such 1-designs to 2-designs. In particular, starting from the Pauli basis $\unicode{x2014}$ the prototypical unitary 1-design $\unicode{x2014}$ one $\unicode{x201C}$naturally$\unicode{x201D}$ obtains the 2-design originally employed by Bennett and coauthors in $\textit{Mixed State Entanglement and Quantum Error Correction}$. The present work also serves as a gentle and largely self-contained introduction to the subject.

In this work, we present the first stability results for approximate predictors in multi-input non-linear systems with distinct actuation delays. We show that if the predictor approximation satisfies a uniform (in time) error bound, semi-global practical stability is correspondingly achieved. For such approximators, the required uniform error bound depends on the desired region of attraction and the number of control inputs in the system. The result is achieved through transforming the delay into a transport PDE and conducting analysis on the coupled ODE-PDE cascade. To highlight the viability of such error bounds, we demonstrate our results on a class of approximators - neural operators - showcasing sufficiency for satisfying such a universal bound both theoretically and in simulation on a mobile robot experiment.

I study Hodge decomposition (HodgeRank) for urban traffic flow on two graph representations: dense origin--destination (OD) graphs and road-segment networks. Reproducing the method of Aoki et al., we observe that on dense OD graphs the curl and harmonic components are negligible and the potential closely tracks node divergence, limiting the added value of Hodge potentials. In contrast, on a real road network (UTD19, downtown Los Angeles; 15-minute resolution), potentials differ substantially from divergence and exhibit clear morning/evening reversals consistent with commute patterns. We quantify smoothness and discriminability via local/global variances derived from the graph spectrum, and propose flow-aware embeddings that combine topology, bidirectional volume, and net-flow asymmetry for clustering. Code and preprocessing steps are provided to facilitate reproducibility.

Self-driving cars operate in constantly changing environments and are exposed to a variety of uncertainties and disturbances. These factors render classical controllers ineffective, especially for lateral control. Therefore, an adaptive MPC controller is designed in this paper for the path tracking task, tuned by an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Online parameter adaptation is performed using Neural Networks and ANFIS. The designed controller showed promising results compared to standard MPC in triple lane change and trajectory tracking scenarios. Code can be found here: this https URL

Equivalence relations between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames
Katarzyna Siudzińska
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Quantum measurements play a fundamental role in quantum information. Therefore, increasing efforts are being made to construct symmetric measurement operators for qudit systems. A wide class of projective measurements corresponds to complex projective 2-designs, which include symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVMs and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). In this paper, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames, both of which are common generalizations of SIC POVMs and MUBs to operators of arbitrary rank. It turns out that there exist rich families of operators that belong to only one of those two classes. This raises important questions about which symmetries have to be preserved for applicational prominence.

Privacy-preserving state estimation for linear time-invariant dynamical systems with crowd sensors is considered. At any time step, the estimator has access to measurements from a randomly selected sensor from a pool of sensors with pre-specified models and noise profiles. A Luenberger-like observer is used to fuse the measurements with the underlying model of the system to recursively generate the state estimates. An additive privacy-preserving noise is used to constrain information leakage. Information leakage is measured via mutual information between the identity of the sensors and the state estimate conditioned on the actual state of the system. This captures an omnipotent adversary that not only can access state estimates but can also gather direct high-quality state measurements. Any prescribed level of information leakage is shown to be achievable by appropriately selecting the variance of the privacy-preserving noise. Therefore, privacy-utility trade-off can be fine-tuned.

There exist numerous ways of representing 3D orientations. Each representation has both limitations and unique features. Choosing the best representation for one task is often a difficult chore, and there exist conflicting opinions on which representation is better suited for a set of family of tasks. Even worse, when dealing with scenarios where we need to learn or optimize functions with orientations as inputs and/or outputs, the set of possibilities (representations, loss functions, etc.) is even larger and it is not easy to decide what is best for each scenario. In this paper, we attempt to a) present clearly, concisely and with unified notation all available representations, and "tricks" related to 3D orientations (including Lie Group algebra), and b) benchmark them in representative scenarios. The first part feels like it is missing from the robotics literature as one has to read many different textbooks and papers in order have a concise and clear understanding of all possibilities, while the benchmark is necessary in order to come up with recommendations based on empirical evidence. More precisely, we experiment with the following settings that attempt to cover most widely used scenarios in robotics: 1) direct optimization, 2) imitation/supervised learning with a neural network controller, 3) reinforcement learning, and 4) trajectory optimization using differential dynamic programming. We finally provide guidelines depending on the scenario, and make available a reference implementation of all the orientation math described.

In this work, we offer a thorough analytical investigation into the role of shared hyperparameters in a hierarchical Bayesian model, examining their impact on information borrowing and posterior inference. Our approach is rooted in a non-asymptotic framework, where observations are drawn from a mixed-effects model, and a Gaussian distribution is assumed for the true effect generator. We consider a nested hierarchical prior distribution model to capture these effects and use the posterior means for Bayesian estimation. To quantify the effect of information borrowing, we propose an integrated risk measure relative to the true data-generating distribution. Our analysis reveals that the Bayes estimator for the model with a deeper hierarchy performs better, provided that the unknown random effects are correlated through a compound symmetric structure. Our work also identifies necessary and sufficient conditions for this model to outperform the one nested within it. We further obtain sufficient conditions when the correlation is perturbed. Our study suggests that the model with a deeper hierarchy tends to outperform the nested model unless the true data-generating distribution favors sufficiently independent groups. These findings have significant implications for Bayesian modeling, and we believe they will be of interest to researchers across a wide range of fields.

Trajectory Encryption Cooperative Salvo Guidance

This paper introduces the concept of trajectory encryption in cooperative simultaneous target interception, wherein heterogeneity in guidance principles across a team of unmanned autonomous systems is leveraged as a strategic design feature. By employing a mix of heterogeneous time-to-go formulations leading to a cooperative guidance strategy, the swarm of vehicles is able to generate diverse trajectory families. This diversity expands the feasible solution space for simultaneous target interception, enhances robustness under disturbances, and enables flexible time-to-go adjustments without predictable detouring. From an adversarial perspective, heterogeneity obscures the collective interception intent by preventing straightforward prediction of swarm dynamics, effectively acting as an encryption layer in the trajectory domain. Simulations demonstrate that the swarm of heterogeneous vehicles is able to intercept a moving target simultaneously from a diverse set of initial engagement configurations.

We study denoising of a third-order tensor when the ground-truth tensor is not necessarily Tucker low-rank. Specifically, we observe $$ Y=X^\ast+Z\in \mathbb{R}^{p_{1} \times p_{2} \times p_{3}}, $$ where $X^\ast$ is the ground-truth tensor, and $Z$ is the noise tensor. We propose a simple variant of the higher-order tensor SVD estimator $\widetilde{X}$. We show that uniformly over all user-specified Tucker ranks $(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})$, $$ \| \widetilde{X} - X^* \|_{ \mathrm{F}}^2 = O \Big( \kappa^2 \Big\{ r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}+\sum_{k=1}^{3} p_{k} r_{k} \Big\} \; + \; \xi_{(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})}^2\Big) \quad \text{ with high probability.} $$ Here, the bias term $\xi_{(r_1,r_2,r_3)}$ corresponds to the best achievable approximation error of $X^\ast$ over the class of tensors with Tucker ranks $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$; $\kappa^2$ quantifies the noise level; and the variance term $\kappa^2 \{r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}+\sum_{k=1}^{3} p_{k} r_{k}\}$ scales with the effective number of free parameters in the estimator $\widetilde{X}$. Our analysis achieves a clean rank-adaptive bias--variance tradeoff: as we increase the ranks of estimator $\widetilde{X}$, the bias $\xi(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})$ decreases and the variance increases. As a byproduct we also obtain a convenient bias-variance decomposition for the vanilla low-rank SVD matrix estimators.

Bayesian Semi-supervised Inference via a Debiased Modeling Approach

Inference in semi-supervised (SS) settings has gained substantial attention in recent years due to increased relevance in modern big-data problems. In a typical SS setting, there is a much larger-sized unlabeled data, containing only observations of predictors, and a moderately sized labeled data containing observations for both an outcome and the set of predictors. Such data naturally arises when the outcome, unlike the predictors, is costly or difficult to obtain. One of the primary statistical objectives in SS settings is to explore whether parameter estimation can be improved by exploiting the unlabeled data. We propose a novel Bayesian method for estimating the population mean in SS settings. The approach yields estimators that are both efficient and optimal for estimation and inference. The method itself has several interesting artifacts. The central idea behind the method is to model certain summary statistics of the data in a targeted manner, rather than the entire raw data itself, along with a novel Bayesian notion of debiasing. Specifying appropriate summary statistics crucially relies on a debiased representation of the population mean that incorporates unlabeled data through a flexible nuisance function while also learning its estimation bias. Combined with careful usage of sample splitting, this debiasing approach mitigates the effect of bias due to slow rates or misspecification of the nuisance parameter from the posterior of the final parameter of interest, ensuring its robustness and efficiency. Concrete theoretical results, via Bernstein--von Mises theorems, are established, validating all claims, and are further supported through extensive numerical studies. To our knowledge, this is possibly the first work on Bayesian inference in SS settings, and its central ideas also apply more broadly to other Bayesian semi-parametric inference problems.

We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not its thermodynamic topological classification.

Distributionally Robust Safety Verification of Neural Networks via Worst-Case CVaR
Masako Kishida
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP) framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk. This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids, polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.

Impossibility Results of Card-Based Protocols via Mathematical Optimization
Shunnosuke Ikeda, Kazumasa Shinagawa
Subjects:
Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper introduces mathematical optimization as a new method for proving impossibility proofs in the field of card-based cryptography. While previous impossibility proofs were often limited to cases involving a small number of cards, this new approach establishes results that hold for a large number of cards. The research focuses on single-cut full-open (SCFO) protocols, which consist of performing one random cut and then revealing all cards. The main contribution is that for any three-variable Boolean function, no new SCFO protocols exist beyond those already known, under the condition that all additional cards have the same color. The significance of this work is that it provides a new framework for impossibility proofs and delivers a proof that is valid for any number of cards, as long as all additional cards have the same color.

Empirical AI Ethics: Reconfiguring Ethics towards a Situated, Plural, and Transformative Approach
Paula Helm, Selin Gerlek
Subjects:
Computers and Society (cs.CY); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Mainstream AI ethics, with its reliance on top-down, principle-driven frameworks, fails to account for the situated realities of diverse communities affected by AI (Artificial Intelligence). Critics have argued that AI ethics frequently serves corporate interests through practices of 'ethics washing', operating more as a tool for public relations than as a means of preventing harm or advancing the common good. As a result, growing scepticism among critical scholars has cast the field as complicit in sustaining harmful systems rather than challenging or transforming them. In response, this paper adopts a Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspective to critically interrogate the field of AI ethics. It hence applies the same analytic tools STS has long directed at disciplines such as biology, medicine, and statistics to ethics. This perspective reveals a core tension between vertical (top-down, principle-based) and horizontal (risk-mitigating, implementation-oriented) approaches to ethics. By tracing how these models have shaped the discourse, we show how both fall short in addressing the complexities of AI as a socio-technical assemblage, embedded in practice and entangled with power. To move beyond these limitations, we propose a threefold reorientation of AI ethics. First, we call for a shift in foundations: from top-down abstraction to empirical grounding. Second, we advocate for pluralisation: moving beyond Western-centric frameworks toward a multiplicity of onto-epistemic perspectives. Finally, we outline strategies for reconfiguring AI ethics as a transformative force, moving from narrow paradigms of risk mitigation toward co-creating technologies of hope.

A Generative Conditional Distribution Equality Testing Framework and Its Minimax Analysis
Siming Zheng, Meifang Lan, Tong Wang, Yuanyuan Lin
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
In this paper, we propose a general framework for testing the equality of the conditional distributions in a two-sample problem. This problem is most relevant to transfer learning under covariate shift. Our framework is built on neural network-based generative methods and sample splitting techniques by transforming the conditional distribution testing problem into an unconditional one. We introduce two special tests: the generative permutation-based conditional distribution equality test and the generative classification accuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. Theoretically, we establish a minimax lower bound for statistical inference in testing the equality of two conditional distributions under certain smoothness conditions. We demonstrate that the generative permutation-based conditional distribution equality test and its modified version can attain this lower bound precisely or up to some iterated logarithmic factor. Moreover, we prove the testing consistency of the generative classification accuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. We also establish the convergence rate for the learned conditional generator by deriving new results related to the recently-developed offset Rademacher complexity and approximation properties using neural networks. Empirically, we conduct numerical studies including synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Well-posedness of Ricci Flow in Lorentzian Spacetime and its Entropy Formula
M.J.Luo
Comments:

Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper attempts to construct monotonic entropy functionals for four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime under certain physical boundary conditions, as an extension of Perelman's monotonic entropy functionals constructed for three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds. The monotonicity of these entropy functionals is utilized to prove the well-posedness of applying Ricci flow to four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, particularly for the timelike modes which would seem blow up and ill-defined. The general idea is that the the Ricci flow of a Lorentzian spacetime metric and the coupled conjugate heat flow of a density on the Lorentzian spacetime as a whole turns out to be the gradient flows of the monotonic functionals under some imposed constraint, so the superficial "blow-up" in the individual Ricci flow system or the conjugate heat flow system contradicts the boundedness of the monotonic functionals within finite flow interval, which gives a global control to the whole coupled system. The physical significance and applications of these monotonic entropy functionals in real gravitational systems are also discussed.

EigenSafe: A Spectral Framework for Learning-Based Stochastic Safety Filtering

We present EigenSafe, an operator-theoretic framework for learning-enabled safety-critical control for stochastic systems. In many robotic systems where dynamics are best modeled as stochastic systems due to factors such as sensing noise and environmental disturbances, it is challenging for conventional methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to provide a holistic measure of safety. We derive a linear operator governing the dynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its dominant eigenpair provides information about safety for both individual states and the overall closed-loop system. The proposed learning framework, called EigenSafe, jointly learns this dominant eigenpair and a safe backup policy in an offline manner. The learned eigenfunction is then used to construct a safety filter that detects potentially unsafe situations and falls back to the backup policy. The framework is validated in three simulated stochastic safety-critical control tasks.

Differential equations are one of the main approaches to evaluate multi-loop Feynman integrals. The construction of a canonical or $\varepsilon$-factorised basis for multi-loop integrals remains a key bottleneck for this approach, especially when the differential equation involves non dlog-forms. Recently, several methods have been proposed to find $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. Many of them introduce new functions that are themselves defined as iterated integrals. If and when these iterated integrals can be explicitly evaluated in terms of other classes of functions remains an open problem. In this paper we elaborate on the recent proposal that one can use the fact that the intersection matrix computed in a canonical basis can be used to derive polynomial relations between these iterated integrals. On the one hand, we discuss properties of the canonical intersection matrix, in particular methods to determine the intersection matrix in a canonical basis. On the other hand we show how one can reduce the non-linear constraints on the iterated integrals to linear ones. We illustrate these ideas on examples involving Calabi-Yau varieties and higher-genus Riemann surfaces.

Global Optimization via Softmin Energy Minimization

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Global optimization, particularly for non-convex functions with multiple local minima, poses significant challenges for traditional gradient-based methods. While metaheuristic approaches offer empirical effectiveness, they often lack theoretical convergence guarantees and may disregard available gradient information. This paper introduces a novel gradient-based swarm particle optimization method designed to efficiently escape local minima and locate global optima. Our approach leverages a "Soft-min Energy" interacting function, $J_\beta(\mathbf{x})$, which provides a smooth, differentiable approximation of the minimum function value within a particle swarm. We define a stochastic gradient flow in the particle space, incorporating a Brownian motion term for exploration and a time-dependent parameter $\beta$ to control smoothness, similar to temperature annealing. We theoretically demonstrate that for strongly convex functions, our dynamics converges to a stationary point where at least one particle reaches the global minimum, with other particles exhibiting exploratory behavior. Furthermore, we show that our method facilitates faster transitions between local minima by reducing effective potential barriers with respect to Simulated Annealing. More specifically, we estimate the hitting times of unexplored potential wells for our model in the small noise regime and show that they compare favorably with the ones of overdamped Langevin. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions, including double wells and the Ackley function, validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate better performance over the well-known Simulated Annealing method in terms of escaping local minima and achieving faster convergence.

Quantum Portfolio Optimization: An Extensive Benchmark

Comments:

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Recently, several researchers proposed portfolio optimization as a potential use case for quantum optimization. However, the literature is lacking an extensive benchmark quantifying the potential of quantum computers for portfolio optimization. In this work, we fill this gap. We provide a computational study, comparing quantum approaches against state-of-the-art classical methods on a meaningful, real-world instance set. In particular, we compare quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm against classical mixed-integer programming, simulated annealing, steepest descent local search, tabu search and a problem-tailored heuristics. We consider a variant of portfolio optimization which we show to be particular difficult for classical solvers in practice. Our benchmark comprises 250 instances with up to 1,000 assets from actual stock data. The results show that all instances can be solved to proven optimality by mixed-integer programming in the order of seconds. Moreover, the problem-tailored heuristic consistently outperforms quantum approaches in terms of solution quality for fixed runtime. Thus, we conclude that there is only very limited room for a potential quantum advantage in portfolio optimization.

On the Variational Costs of Changing Our Minds

Comments:
Accepted as a full paper at the 6th International Workshop on Active Inference
Subjects:
Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Theory (cs.IT)
The human mind is capable of extraordinary achievements, yet it often appears to work against itself. It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms.
We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so, we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from desired belief updating processes.

The hereditariness problem for the Černý conjecture
Emanuele Rodaro, Riccardo Venturi
Comments:
24 pages
Subjects:
Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL); Combinatorics (math.CO)
This paper addresses the lifting problem for the Černý conjecture: namely, whether the validity of the conjecture for a quotient automaton can always be transferred (or "lifted") to the original automaton. Although a complete solution remains open, we show that it is sufficient to verify the Černý conjecture for three specific subclasses of reset automata: radical, simple, and quasi-simple. Our approach relies on establishing a Galois connection between the lattices of congruences and ideals of the transition monoid. This connection not only serves as the main tool in our proofs but also provides a systematic method for computing the radical ideal and for deriving structural insights about these classes. In particular, we show that for every simple or quasi-simple automaton $\mathcal{A}$, the transition monoid $\text{M}(\mathcal{A})$ possesses a unique ideal covering the minimal ideal of constant (reset) maps; a result of similar flavor holds for the class of radical automata.

Accepted for publication in IEEE CDC 2025
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we propose an iterative training algorithm for Neural ODEs that provides models resilient to control (parameter) disturbances. The method builds on our earlier work Tuning without Forgetting-and similarly introduces training points sequentially, and updates the parameters on new data within the space of parameters that do not decrease performance on the previously learned training points-with the key difference that, inspired by the concept of flat minima, we solve a minimax problem for a non-convex non-concave functional over an infinite-dimensional control space. We develop a projected gradient descent algorithm on the space of parameters that admits the structure of an infinite-dimensional Banach subspace. We show through simulations that this formulation enables the model to effectively learn new data points and gain robustness against control disturbance.

Reinforced Generation of Combinatorial Structures: Applications to Complexity Theory

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve provable limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" Håstad-style PCPs.
A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

Modelling optimal generation of an arbitrary N-qubit quantum gate within the generalized Bloch vectors formalism due to the Pontryagin principle

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
This paper is devoted to the problem of optimal generation of N-qubit gates for closed quantum systems -- a key task for the practical implementation of various quantum applications. Based on the generalized Bloch vectors formalism for a finite-dimensional quantum system, we develop a new optimal gates generation model, which is universal in the sense that it is applicable for an arbitrary N-qubit gate, any Hamiltonian of a closed N-qubit system and within this model an optimal control is determined only by N-qubit system parameters and does not depend on its initial state. Within the developed model, the synthesis of optimal control, carried out via the Pontryagin principle, leads to the boundary value problem for the system of ODEs, which can be explored by various computational methods. Numerical experiments conducted for generation of a variety of one/two/three qubit gates demonstrate viability of the developed optimal model which allows one to generate N-qubit quantum gates with a high degree of precision.

We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.

In 1992, Erd$ő$s and Hegyv$á$ri showed that for any prime p, there exist infinitely many length 3 weakly prime-additive numbers divisible by p. In 2018, Fang and Chen showed that for any positive integer m, there exists infinitely many length 3 weakly prime-additive numbers divisible by m if and only if 8 does not divide m. Under the assumption (*) of existence of a prime in certain arithmetic progression with prescribed primitive root, which is true under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we show for any positive integer m, there exists infinitely many length 4 weakly prime-additive numbers divisible by m. We also present another related result analogous to the length 3 case shown by Fang and Chen.

To a singular knot K with n double points, one can associate a chord diagram with n chords. A chord diagram can also be understood as a 4-regular graph endowed with an oriented Euler circuit. L. Traldi introduced a polynomial invariant for such graphs, called a transition polynomial. We specialize this polynomial to a multiplicative weight system, that is, a function on chord diagrams satisfying 4-term relations and determining thus a finite type knot invariant. We prove a similar statement for the transition polynomial of general ribbon graphs and binary delta-matroids defined by R. Brijder and H. J. Hoogeboom, which defines, as a consequence, a finite type invariant of links.

As side results, we rediscover Fermat's Little Theorem and a "Fermat-like" congruence for Lucas numbers.

On the Complexity of Properties of Partial Bijection Semigroups
Trevor Jack
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
We examine the computational complexity of problems in which we are given generators for a partial bijection semigroup and asked to check properties of the generated semigroup. We prove that the following problems are in AC$^0$: (1) enumerating left and right identities and (2) checking if the semigroup is completely regular. We also describe a nondeterministic logspace algorithm for checking if an inverse semigroup given by generators satisfies a fixed semigroup identity that may involve a unary inverse operation. We conclude with an alternative proof that checking membership of a given idempotent in a partial bijection semigroup is a PSPACE-complete problem. The proof reduces from the well-known PSPACE-complete Rectangle Tiling Problem, thereby illustrating a connection between Wang tilings and partial bijection semigroups.

We use a trivial delta method with multiplicative characters for congruence detection to prove the Weyl bound for GL(2) in $t$-aspect for a holomorphic or Hecke-Maass cusp form of arbitrary level and nebentypus. This parallels the work of Aggarwal in 2018, with the difference being multiplicative character has a more natural connection to the twisted $L$-function. This provides another view point to understand and explore the trivial and other delta methods.

We generalize Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's local model for the trianguline variety to certain points with non-regular Hodge-Tate weights. With the local models we are able to prove, under the Taylor-Wiles hypothesis, the existence of certain companion points on the global eigenvariety and the appearance of related companion constituents in the completed cohomology for non-regular crystalline Galois representations. The new ingredients in the proof of the global applications are results relating the partial classicality of locally analytic representations (the existence of non-zero locally algebraic vectors in the non-Borel parabolic Emerton's Jacquet modules), the partially de Rham properties of Galois representations (the de Rhamness of graded pieces along the paraboline filtrations of the associated $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over the Robba rings) and the relevant properties of cycles on the generalized Steinberg varieties. We prove that partial classicality implies partial de Rhamness in finite slope cases using Ding's partial eigenvarieties.

Higher Hida theory for Hilbert modular varieties in the totally split case

We study $p$-adic properties of the coherent cohomology of some automorphic sheaves on the Hilbert modular variety $X$ for a totally real field $F$ in the case where the prime $p$ is totally split in $F$. More precisely, we develop higher Hida theory à la Pilloni, constructing, for $0\leq q\leq [F:\mathbb{Q}]$, some modules $M^q$ which $p$-adically interpolate the ordinary part of the cohomology groups $H^q(X, \underline{\omega}^{\kappa})$, varying the weight $\kappa$ of the automorphic sheaf.

The Equivariance Criterion in a Linear Model for Fixed-X Cases
Daowei Wang, Mian Wu, Haojin Zhou
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
The field of machine have seen rising applications of equivariance criterion. However, there is no systematic way to justify its usage, including why it works, whether there is an optimal solution and if so, what form it carries. In this article, we explored the usage of equivariance criterion in a normal linear model with fixed-$X$ and extended the model to allow multiple populations, which, in turn, leads to a multivariate invariant location-scale transformation group, compared than the commonly used univariate one. The minimum risk equivariant estimators of the coefficient vector and the diagonal covariance matrix were derived, which were consistent with literature works. This work serves as an early exploration of the usage of equivariance criterion in machine learning, where we confirmed that the least square approach widely used in machine learning indeed carries optimality in some sense at least in the framework of estimation.
Meanwhile, the problems can be shown to be equivalent to a mixture from $p$ independent normal samples and via the principle of functional equivariance, an alternative proof can be derived. However, such an approach carries its own limitation with a strong tie to equivariance criterion.

Microlocal homology

Comments:
Revised in response to referee feedback
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Representation Theory (math.RT)
Let $Z$ be an l.c.i. scheme over $\mathbb{C}$. In this paper, we introduce a Kashiwara--Schapira-style functor of derived microlocalization, which we use to define a perverse sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ on the $-1$-shifted cotangent bundle, $T^*[-1]Z$. The sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ is designed to be a refinement of the microlocal homology of $Z$: a family of invariants introduced by Nadler that interpolates between the singular cohomology and Borel--Moore homology of $Z$.
Our main result is an equivalence between $\mu_{Z}$ and the DT sheaf $\varphi_{T^*[-1]Z}$ on $T^*[-1]Z$. This provides an alternative construction for the DT sheaf in the case of a shifted cotangent bundle. The main step of our argument, which may be of independent interest, is a local computation -- closely related to one obtained recently by Kinjo using different methods -- providing a description of the classical microlocalization functor in terms of vanishing cycles.

The aims of this paper are to answer several conjectures and questions about multiplier spectrum of rational maps and to give new proofs of several rigidity theorems in complex dynamics, by combining tools from complex and non-archimedean dynamics.
A remarkable theorem due to McMullen asserts that aside from the flexible Lattès family, the multiplier spectrum of periodic points determines the conjugacy class of rational maps up to finitely many choices. The proof relies on Thurston's rigidity theorem for post-critically finite maps, in which Teichmüller theory is an essential tool. We will give a new proof of McMullen's theorem without using quasiconformal maps or Teichmüller theory.
We show that aside from the flexible Lattès family, the length spectrum of periodic points determines the conjugacy class of rational maps up to finitely many choices. This generalizes the aforementioned McMullen's theorem. We will also prove a rigidity theorem for marked length spectrum. Similar ideas also yield a simple proof of a rigidity theorem due to Zdunik.
We show that a rational map is exceptional if and only if one of the following holds (i) the multipliers of periodic points are contained in the integer ring of an imaginary quadratic field; (ii) all but finitely many periodic points have the same Lyapunov exponent. This solves two conjectures of Milnor.

Motivated by the work of Bestvina-Feighn ([BF92]) and Mj-Sardar ([MS12]), we define trees of metric bundles subsuming both the trees of metric spaces and the metric bundles. Then we prove a combination theorem for these spaces. More precisely, we prove that the total space of a tree of metric bundles is hyperbolic if the following hold (see Theorem $1.5$). $(1)$ The fibers are uniformly hyperbolic metric spaces and the base is also hyperbolic metric space, $(2)$ barycenter maps for the fibers are uniformly coarsely surjective, $(3)$ the edge spaces are uniformly qi embedded in the corresponding fibers and $(4)$ the Bestvina-Feighn hallway flaring condition is satisfied.
As an application, we provide a combination theorem for certain complexes of groups over finite simplicial complex (see Theorem $1.3$).

This is done by implementing the pointwise tiling idea of [Tse18] in the more complex setting of continuum-to-one Borel transformations. Along the way, we establish a vanishing markers lemma for these transformations, which generalizes its well-known counterpart for invertible transformations.

The wandering domain problem for attracting polynomial skew products

Wandering Fatou components were recently constructed by Astorg et al for higher-dimensional holomorphic maps on projective spaces. Their examples are polynomial skew products with a parabolic invariant line. In this paper, we study this wandering domain problem for polynomial skew product $f$ with an attracting invariant line $L$ (which is the more common case). We show that if $f$ is unicritical (in the sense that the critical curve has a unique transversal intersection with $L$), then every Fatou component of $f$ in the basin of $L$ is an extension of a one-dimensional Fatou component of $f|_L$. As a corollary, there is no wandering Fatou component. We will also discuss the multicritical case under additional assumptions.

Theoretical analysis of the randomized subspace regularized Newton method for non-convex optimization

While there already exist randomized subspace Newton methods that restrict the search direction to a random subspace for a convex function, we propose a randomized subspace regularized Newton method for a non-convex function {and more generally we investigate thoroughly the local convergence rate of the randomized subspace Newton method}.
In our proposed algorithm using a modified Hessian of the function restricted to some random subspace, with high probability, the function value decreases even when the objective function is non-convex.
In this paper, we show that our method has global convergence under appropriate assumptions and its convergence rate is the same as that of the full regularized Newton method. %We also prove that Furthermore, we can obtain a local linear convergence rate under some additional assumptions, and prove that this rate is the best we can hope, in general, when using random subspace. We furthermore prove that if the Hessian at the local optimum is rank defficient then superlienar convergence holds.

A vanishing theorem for uniformly RC $k$-positive Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles is established. It turns out that the holomorphic tangent bundle of a compact complex manifold equipped with a positive $k$-Ricci curvature Kähler metric is uniformly RC $k$-positive. Two main applications are presented. The first one is to deduce that spaces of some holomorphic tensor fields on such Kähler or more generally Kähler-like Hermitian manifolds are trivial, generalizing some recent results. The second one is to show that a compact Kähler manifold whose holomorphic tangent bundle can be endowed with either a uniformly RC $k$-positive Hermitian metric or a positive $k$-Ricci curvature Kähler-like Hermitian metric is projective and rationally connected.

Let $A(1,m)$ be the Fourier coefficients of a $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$ Hecke-Maass cusp form $\pi_1$ and $\lambda(m)$ be those of a $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Hecke holomorphic or Hecke-Mass cusp form $\pi_2$. Let $H\subset[\![ -X^{1-\varepsilon},X^{1+\varepsilon}]\!]$ and $\{a(h)\}_{h\in H}\subset\mathbb{C}$ be a sequence. We show that if $H\subset \ell+[\![ 0,X^{1/2+\varepsilon}]\!] $ for some $\ell\geq0$, \begin{align*}
D_{a,H}(X):=\frac{1}{|H|}\sum_{h\in H}a(h)\sum_{m=1}^\infty A(1,m)\lambda(rm+h)V\left(\frac{m}{X}\right)\ll_{\pi_1,\pi_2,\varepsilon} \frac{X^{1+\varepsilon}}{|H|}\|a\|_2
\end{align*}
for any $\varepsilon>0$, and a similar bound when $|H|$ is big. This improves Sun's bound and generalizes it to an average with arbitrary weights. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can recover the factorizable moduli structure given by the Jutila's circle method via studying a shifted sum with weighted average. This allows us to recover Munshi's bound on the shifted sum with a fixed shift without using the Jutila's circle method.

Averaging principle for two time-scale stochastic differential equations with fast component in noncompact space

Probability (math.PR)
The asymptotic behavior for fully coupled multiscale stochastic systems becomes much complicated when the fast processes do not locate in a compact space. An example is constructed to show that the averaged coefficients may become discontinuous even they are originally Lipschitz continuous when the fast process locate in a noncompact space. This work aims to reveal the impact of ergodicity of the fast process on the establishment of the averaging principle. The crucial point is to characterize the continuous dependence of the invariant probability measure on parameters related to the slow process with respect to various distances in the Wasserstein space.

Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.

We find criteria ensuring that a local (holomorphic, real analytic, $C^1$) homeomorphism between the Julia sets of two given rational functions comes from an algebraic correspondence. For example, we show that if there is a local $C^1$-symmetry between the maximal entropy measures of two rational functions, then probably up to a complex conjugation, the two rational functions are dynamically related by an algebraic correspondence. The holomorphic case of our criterion will play an important role in the authors' upcoming proof of the Dynamical André-Oort conjecture for curves.

Subjects:

A connected Cayley graph on an abelian group with a finite generating set $S$ can be represented by its Heuberger matrix, i.e., an integer matrix whose columns generate the group of relations between members of $S$. In a previous article, the authors laid the foundation for the use of Heuberger matrices to study chromatic numbers of abelian Cayley graphs. We call the number of rows in the Heuberger matrix the {\it dimension}, and the number of columns the {\it rank}. In this paper, we give precise numerical conditions that completely determine the chromatic number in all cases with dimension $1$; with rank $1$; and with dimension $\leq 3$ and rank $\leq 2$. For such a graph without loops, we show that it is $4$-colorable if and only if it does not contain a $5$-clique, and it is $3$-colorable if and only if it contains neither a diamond lanyard nor a $C_{13}(1,5)$, both of which we define herein. It is shown in another paper that as a special case of our theorem for dimension $3$ and rank $2$, we obtain improved upper bounds for minimal periods of optimal colorings of $6$-valent integer distance graphs.

Convergence analysis of equilibrium methods for inverse problems

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)
Solving inverse problems \(Ax = y\) is central to a variety of practically important fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. The most successful and theoretically best-understood method is convex variational regularization, where approximate but stable solutions are defined as minimizers of \( \|A(\cdot) - y^\delta\|^2 / 2 + \alpha \mathcal{R}(\cdot)\), with \(\mathcal{R}\) a regularization functional. Recent methods such as deep equilibrium models and plug-and-play approaches, however, go beyond variational regularization. Motivated by these innovations, we introduce implicit non-variational (INV) regularization, where approximate solutions are defined as solutions of \(A^*(A x - y^\delta) + \alpha R(x) = 0\) for some regularization operator \(R\). When the regularization operator is the gradient of a functional, INV reduces to classical variational regularization. However, in methods like DEQ and PnP, \(R\) is not a gradient field, and the existing theoretical foundation remains incomplete. To address this, we establish stability and convergence results in this broader setting, including convergence rates and stability estimates measured via a absolute Bregman distance.

We improve the bound on the number of tetrahedra in the veering triangulation of a fully-punctured pseudo-Anosov mapping torus in terms of the normalized dilatation. When the mapping torus has only one boundary component, we can improve the bound further. Together with the author's work with Hironaka in the case when the mapping torus has at least two boundary components, this allows us to understand small elements of the set $\mathcal{D}$ of normalized dilatations of fully-punctured pseudo-Anosov maps using computational means. In particular, we certify that the minimum element of $\mathcal{D}$ is $\mu^2$ and the minimum accumulation point of $\mathcal{D}$ is $\mu^4$, where $\mu$ is the golden ratio.

We characterize the subsets $E$ of a metric space $X$ with doubling measure whose distance function to some negative power $\textrm{dist}(\cdot,E)^{-\alpha}$ belongs to the Muckenhoupt $A_1$ class of weights in $X$. To this end, we introduce the weakly porous sets in this setting, and show that, along with certain doubling-type conditions for the sizes of the largest $E$-free holes, these sets characterize the mentioned $A_1$-property. We exhibit examples showing the optimality of these conditions, and simplify them in the particular case where the underlying measure satisfies a qualitative annular decay property. In addition, we use some of these distance functions as a new and simple method to explicitly construct doubling weights in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that do not belong to $A_\infty.$

On $p$-adic denseness of quotients of values of integral forms
Deepa Antony, Rupam Barman, Stevan Gajović, Daniel Širola
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Given $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the ratio set or the quotient set of $A$ is defined by $R(A):=\{a/b: a, b\in A, b\neq 0\}$. It is an open problem to study the denseness of $R(A)$ in the $p$-adic numbers when $A$ is the set of values attained by an integral form. In this paper, we consider the question of whether this happens for all but finitely many $p$. We prove that if a form is non-singular and has at least three variables, then the ratio set of its values is dense in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for all sufficiently large $p$. We conjecture that the same statement is true for non-degenerate forms of prime degree having sufficiently many variables, which is indeed the case when the degree is 2, 3, or 5. Still, we give two counterexamples when the assumptions of the conjecture are not satisfied. The first one happens when the number of variables is equal to the degree. The other works for any number of variables but only for composite degrees. Our innovation is to consider the problem in terms of varieties defined by forms, thereby using the tools from algebraic geometry, making their first appearance in this setting. Finally, we construct integral forms such that the ratio set of its values is dense in at least one $\mathbb{Q}_p$ but only in finitely many of them.

We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.

We introduce system norms which assess transient behavior of stable Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. This allows us to address undesired responses to initial conditions, finite resource consumption signals, or persistent perturbations. We then consider the challenging problem of minimizing these norms in closed loop using structured linear feedback. The computed controllers mitigate transients in a linearized closed loop, with the potential side effect of enlarging the region of stability of the underlying non-linear controlled system. In applications this helps to prevent transition to undesired nonlinear regimes, limit cycles or chaotic behavior. The success of our approach is certified a posteriori using Lyapunov-like techniques and simulations, as we demonstrate through a variety of applications.

Specifically, we derive and numerically integrate a version of the classical Lelieuvre formulas that apply to immersions of $C^{1,1}$ hyperbolic surfaces of non-constant curvature. In contrast to the constant curvature case, these formulas do not provide an explicit method for constructing an immersion but rather describe an immersion via an implicit set of equations. We propose an iterative method for resolving these equations. Because we are interested in scenarios where the curvature is a function of the intrinsic material coordinates, in particular, on the geodesic distance from an origin or from an edge, we suggest a fast marching method for computing geodesic distance on manifolds. We apply our methods to generate surfaces of non-constant curvature and demonstrate how one can introduce branch points to account for the multi-generational buckling and subwrinkling observed in many applications.

Crossing estimates for the Ising model on general s-embeddings
Rémy Mahfouf
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We prove Russo-Seymour-Welsh type crossing estimates for the FK-Ising model on general s-embeddings whose origami map has an asymptotic Lipschitz constant strictly smaller than $1$, provided a mild non-degeneracy assumption is satisfied. This result extends the original work of Chelkak and provides a general framework to prove that connection probabilities between boundaries of boxes remain bounded away from $0$ and $1$. It is explained that one cannot prove similar estimates without a similar assumption on the origami map, and allows to propose some notion of critical model for generic planar graphs, that can be rephrased from the perspective of the associated propagator operator. This paper reproves along the way corresponding results in almost all already known setups and also treats new ones of interest.

In this paper, we consider the multiplier spectrum of periodic points, which is a natural morphism defined on the moduli space of rational maps on the projective line. A celebrated theorem of McMullen asserts that aside from the well-understood flexible Lattès family, the multiplier spectrum morphism is quasi-finite. In this paper, we strengthen McMullen's theorem by showing that the multiplier spectrum morphism is generically injective. This answers a question of McMullen and Poonen.

Considering the damped wave equation with a Gaussian noise $F$ where $F$ is white in time and has a covariance function depending on spatial variables, we will see that this equation has a mild solution which is stationary in time $t$. We define a weakly self-avoiding polymer with intrinsic length $J$ associated to this SPDE. Our main result is that the polymer has an effective radius of approximately $J^{5/3}$.

Exceptional sequences of type $B_n/C_n$ and those in the abelian tube

We examine clusters in the cluster tube of rank $n+1$ using exceptional sequences in the abelian tube of rank $n+1$. Although the abelian tube has more exceptional sequences than the module categories of type $B_{n}/C_{n}$, we obtain a bijection between the set of signed exceptional sequences of any length in these categories. This bijection gives a reinterpretation of the formula of Buan-Marsh-Vatne comparing clusters of type $B_n/C_n$ with maximal rigid objects in the cluster tube of rank $n+1$. The bijection passes through the set of "augmented" rooted labeled trees.

Break-Resilient Codes

We investigate the problem of encoding data into an $(n, t)$-break-resilient code ($(n, t)$-BRC), i.e., a collections of sequences of length~$n$ from which the original data can be reconstructed even if they are adversarially broken at up to~$t$ arbitrary positions. We establish lower bounds on the redundancy of any $(n, t)$-BRC and present code constructions that meet these bounds up to asymptotically negligible terms. Interestingly, this problem shares similarities with the recently studied torn paper channel, which has emerged in the context of DNA data storage.

Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring, $I$ an ideal of $R$ and $M$ a finitely generated $R$-module with $\dim_R(M)=d$. Denote by $\depth_R(I,M)$ the depth of $M$ in $I$. In \cite{HT}, C. Huneke and V. Trivedi proved that if $R$ is a quotient of a regular ring then there exists a finite subset $\Lambda_M $ of $\Spec(R)$ such that
$$\depth_R(I,M)=\underset{\p\in \Lambda_M}{\min} \big\{ \depth_{R_{\p}}(M_{\p})+ \docao\big((I+\p)/\p\big) \big\}.$$
Denote by $\Psupp^i_R(M)=\{\frak p\in\Spec(R)\mid H^{i-\dim(R/\frak p)}_{\frak p R_{\frak p}}(M_{\frak p})\neq 0\}$ the $i$-th pseudo support of $M$ defined by M. Brodmann and R. Y. Sharp \cite{BS1}. In this paper, we prove that if $\Psupp^i_R(M)$ is closed for all $i\leq d$ then the above formula of $\depth_R(I,M)$ holds true, where $\Lambda_M =\underset{0\leq i\leq d}{\bigcup} \min \Psupp^i_R(M)$. In particular, if $R$ is a quotient of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring then $\Lambda_M =\underset{0\leq i\leq d}{\bigcup}\min\Var\big(\Ann_R(H_{\m}^i(M))\big)$. We also give some examples to clarify the results.

A distinguished family of completely prime primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra of a reductive Lie algebra ${\mathfrak g}$ over ${\mathbb C}$ are those ideals constructed from one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras. We refer to these ideals as Losev--Premet ideals. For ${\mathfrak g}$ simple of classical type, we prove that for a Losev-Premet ideal $I$ in $U({\mathfrak g})$, there exists a Losev-Premet ideal $I_0$ for a certain Levi subalgebra ${\mathfrak g}_0$ of ${\mathfrak g}$ such that associated variety of $I_0$ is the closure of a rigid nilpotent orbit in ${\mathfrak g}_0$ and $I$ is obtained from $I_0$ by parabolic induction; in turn, this gives a classification of rigid Losev-Premet ideals in $U({\mathfrak g})$. This is deduced from the corresponding statement about one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras.

Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.

Outer Channel of DNA-Based Data Storage: Capacity and Efficient Coding Schemes
Xuan He, Yi Ding, Kui Cai, Guanghui Song, Bin Dai, Xiaohu Tang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
In this paper, we consider the outer channel for DNA-based data storage. When transmitting over the outer channel, each DNA string is treated as a unit/symbol that would be either correctly received, or erased, or corrupted by uniformly distributed random symbol substitution errors, and all strings are randomly shuffled with each other. We first derive the capacity of the outer channel, which implies that the uniformly distributed random symbol substitution errors are only as harmful as the erasure errors (for infinite-length non-binary random linear codes with near maximum likelihood decoding). Next, we propose practically efficient coding schemes which encode the bits at the same position of different strings into a codeword. We compute the soft/hard information of each bit, which allows us to independently decode the bits within a codeword, leading to an independent decoding scheme. To improve the decoding performance, we measure the reliability of each string based on the independent decoding result, and perform a further step of decoding over the most reliable strings, leading to a joint decoding scheme. Simulations with low-density parity-check codes confirm that the joint decoding scheme can reduce the frame error rate by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the independent decoding scheme, and it can outperform the state-of-the-art decoding scheme in the literature across a wide range of parameter regions.

Stochastic Bregman Proximal Gradient Method Revisited: Kernel Conditioning and Painless Variance Reduction
Junyu Zhang
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We investigate stochastic Bregman proximal gradient (SBPG) methods for minimizing a finite-sum nonconvex function $\Psi(x):=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nf_i(x)+\phi(x)$, where $\phi$ is convex and nonsmooth, while $f_i$, instead of gradient global Lipschitz continuity, satisfies a smooth-adaptability condition w.r.t. some kernel $h$. Standard acceleration techniques for stochastic algorithms (momentum, shuffling, variance reduction) depend on bounding stochastic errors by gradient differences that are further controlled via Lipschitz property. Lacking this, existing SBPG results are limited to vanilla stochastic approximation that cannot yield the optimal $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity dependence on $n$. Moreover, existing works report complexities under various nonstandard stationarity measures that largely deviate from the standard minimal limiting Fréchet subdifferential $\mathrm{dist}(0,\partial\Psi(\cdot))$. Our analysis reveals that these popular stationarity measures are often much smaller than $\mathrm{dist}(0,\partial\Psi(\cdot))$, leading to overstated solution quality and non-stationary output. To resolve these issues, we design a new gradient mapping $\mathcal{D}_{\phi,h}^\lambda (\cdot)$ by BPG residuals in dual space and a new kernel-conditioning (KC) regularity, under which the mismatch between $\|\mathcal{D}_{\phi,h}^\lambda (\cdot)\|$ and $\mathrm{dist}(0,\partial\Psi(\cdot))$ is provably $O(1)$ and instance-free. Moreover, KC-regularity guarantees Lipschitz-like bounds for gradient differences, providing general analysis tools for momentum, shuffling, and variance reduction under smooth-adaptability. We illustrate this point on variance reduced SBPG methods and establish an $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity for $\|\mathcal{D}_{\phi,h}^\lambda (\cdot)\|$, providing instance-free (worst-case) complexity under $\mathrm{dist}(0,\partial\Psi(\cdot))$.

Irrationality of degenerations of Fano varieties

In this paper we investigate the degrees of irrationality of degenerations of $\epsilon$-lc Fano varieties of arbitrary dimensions. We show that given a generically $\epsilon$-lc klt Fano fibration $X\to Z$ of dimension $d$ over a smooth curve $Z$ such that $(X, t F)$ is lc for a positive real number $t$ where $F$ is the reduction of an irreducible central fibre of $X$ over a closed point $z\in Z$, then $F$ admits a rational dominant map $\pi\colon F\dashrightarrow C$ to a smooth projective variety $C$ with bounded degree of irrationality depending only on $\epsilon, d, t$ such that the general fibres of $\pi$ are irreducible and rational. This proves the generically bounded case of a conjecture proposed by the first author and Loginov for log Fano fibrations of dimensions greater than three. One of the key ingredients in our proof is to modify the generically $\epsilon$-lc klt Fano fibration $X\to Z$ to a toroidal morphism of toroidal embeddings with bounded general fibres.

We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that König's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.

Data-Driven Discovery of PDEs via the Adjoint Method

Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
In this work, we present an adjoint-based method for discovering the underlying governing partial differential equations (PDEs) given data. The idea is to consider a parameterized PDE in a general form and formulate a PDE-constrained optimization problem aimed at minimizing the error of the PDE solution from data. Using variational calculus, we obtain an evolution equation for the Lagrange multipliers (adjoint equations) allowing us to compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters of PDEs given data in a straightforward manner. In particular, we consider a family of parameterized PDEs encompassing linear, nonlinear, and spatial derivative candidate terms, and elegantly derive the corresponding adjoint equations. We show the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying the form of the PDE up to machine accuracy, enabling the accurate discovery of PDEs from data. We also compare its performance with the famous PDE Functional Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics method known as PDE-FIND (Rudy et al., 2017), on both smooth and noisy data sets. Even though the proposed adjoint method relies on forward/backward solvers, it outperforms PDE-FIND for large data sets thanks to the analytic expressions for gradients of the cost function with respect to each PDE parameter.

Markovian Embedding of Nonlinear Memory via Spectral Representation

Subjects:

Differential equations containing memory terms that depend nonlinearly on past states model a variety of non-Markovian processes. In this study, we present a Markovian embedding procedure for such equations with distributed delay by utilising an exact spectral representation of the nonlinear memory function. This allows us to transform the nonlocal system to an equivalent local-in-time system in an abstract extended space. We demonstrate our embedding procedure for two one-dimensional physical models: (i) the walking droplet and (ii) the single-phase Stefan problem. In addition to providing an alternative representation of the underlying physical system, the local representation finds applications in designing efficient time-integrators with time-independent computational costs for memory-dependent systems which typically suffer from growing-in-time costs.

We establish a correspondence between automorphisms and derivations on certain algebras of generalised power series. In particular, we describe a Lie algebra of derivations on a field $k(\!(G)\!)$ of generalised power series, exploiting our knowledge of its group of valuation preserving automorphisms. The correspondence is given by the formal Taylor expansion of the exponential. In order to define the exponential map, we develop an appropriate notion of summability of infinite families in algebras. We show that there is a large class of algebras in which the exponential induces the above correspondence.

Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Systems and Control (eess.SY)
In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.

Treewidth of generalized Hamming graph, bipartite Kneser graph and generalized Petersen graph
Yichen Wang, Mengyu Cao, Zequn Lv, Mei Lu
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $t,q$ and $n$ be positive integers. Write $[q] = \{1,2,\ldots,q\}$. The generalized Hamming graph $H(t,q,n)$ is the graph whose vertex set is the cartesian product of $n$ copies of $[q]$ ($q\ge 2$), where two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is at most $t$. In particular, $H(1,q,n)$ is the well-known Hamming graph and $H(1,2,n)$ is the hypercube. In 2006, Chandran and Kavitha described the asymptotic value of $tw(H(1,q,n))$, where $tw(G)$ denotes the treewidth of $G$. In this paper, we give the exact pathwidth of $H(t,2,n)$ and show that $tw(H(t,q,n)) = \Theta(tq^n/\sqrt{n})$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Based on those results, we show that the treewidth of the bipartite Kneser graph $BK(n,k)$ is $\binom{n}{k} - 1$ when $n$ is sufficiently large relative to $k$ and the bounds of $tw(BK(2k+1,k))$ are given. Moreover, we present the bounds of the treewidth of the generalized Petersen graph.

A graph $H$ is common if its Ramsey multiplicity, i.e., the minimum number of monochromatic copies of $H$ contained in any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$, is asymptotically the same as the number of monochromatic copies in the random $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$. Erdős conjectured that every complete graph is common, which was disproved by Thomason in the 1980s. Till today, a classification of common graphs remains a widely open challenging problem. Grzesik, Lee, Lidický and Volec [Combin. Prob. Comput. 31 (2022), 907--923] conjectured that every $k$-apex of any connected Sidorenko graph is common. We prove for $k\le 5$ that the $k$-apex of any tree is common.

A free boundary problem for an immersed filament in 3D Stokes flow

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We consider a simplified extensible version of a dynamic free boundary problem for a thin filament with radius $\epsilon>0$ immersed in 3D Stokes flow. The 3D fluid is coupled to the quasi-1D filament dynamics via a novel type of angle-averaged Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for the Stokes equations, and much of the difficulty in the analysis lies in understanding this operator. Here we show that the main part of this angle-averaged NtD map about a closed, curved filament is the corresponding operator about a straight filament, for which we can derive an explicit symbol. Remainder terms due to curvature are lower order with respect to regularity or size in $\epsilon$. Using this operator decomposition, it is then possible to show that the simplified free boundary evolution is a third-order parabolic equation and is locally well posed. This establishes a more complete mathematical foundation for the myriad computational results based on slender body approximations for thin immersed elastic structures.

The limiting character, introduced by Tillmann, has been studied recently in the context of Culler-Shalen theory. We extend the methods of the author's previous work to show that certain families of essential twice-punctured tori are detected by an ideal point on the character variety and determine the limiting character at these ideal points. We then provide numerous explicit examples, including certain two-bridge knots, 3-strand pretzel knots, and knots with non-integral toroidal surgeries. We also prove that the union of a once- and a twice-punctured torus inside the $(-3, 5, 5)$ or $(3, -5, -5)$ pretzel knot, both essential, is detected by an ideal point of the character variety and explicitly determine its limiting character.

We consider the set of extremal points of the generalized unit ball induced by gradient total variation seminorms for vector-valued functions on bounded Euclidean domains. These are central to the understanding of sparse solutions and sparse optimization algorithms for variational problems posed among such functions. For cases in which either the domain or the target are one dimensional or the sum of the total variations of each component is used, we prove that these extremals consist of piecewise constant functions with two regions. For definitions involving more involved matrix norms and in particular spectral norms, we produce families of examples to show that the resulting set of extremal points is larger and includes piecewise constant functions with more than two regions. We also consider the total deformation induced by the symmetrized gradient, for which minimization with linear constraints appears in problems of determination of limit loads in a number of continuum mechanical models involving plasticity. For this case, we show piecewise infinitesimally rigid functions with two pieces to be extremal under mild assumptions. Finally, as an example which is not piecewise constant, we prove that unit radial vector fields are extremal for the Frobenius total variation in the plane.

Non-trivial fixed point of a $ψ^4_d$ fermionic theory, II. Anomalous exponent and scaling operators

We consider the Renormalization Group (RG) fixed-point theory associated with a fermionic $\psi^4_d$ model in $d=1,2,3$ with fractional kinetic term, whose scaling dimension is fixed so that the quartic interaction is weakly relevant in the RG sense. The model is defined in terms of a Grassmann functional integral with interaction $V^*$, solving a fixed-point RG equation in the presence of external fields, and a fixed ultraviolet cutoff. We define and construct the field and density scale-invariant response functions, and prove that the critical exponent of the former is the naive one, while that of the latter is anomalous and analytic. We construct the corresponding (almost-)scaling operators, whose two point correlations are scale-invariant up to a remainder term, which decays like a stretched exponential at distances larger than the inverse of the ultraviolet cutoff. Our proof is based on constructive RG methods and, specifically, on a convergent tree expansion for the generating function of correlations, which generalizes the approach developed by three of the authors in a previous publication [A. Giuliani, V. Mastropietro, S. Rychkov, JHEP 01 (2021) 026].

This is the second part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for current-vortex sheets in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The local well-posedness of current-vortex sheets with surface tension has been proved in the first part of the paper sequence [63]. In this paper, we prove the incompressible and zero-surface-tension limits under certain stability conditions. The proof of uniform estimates relies on the analysis of the evolution equation of the free interface via a paradifferential approach, the wave equation of the pressure and a weighted anisotropic structure in vorticity analysis.

Posterior contraction rates in a sparse non-linear mixed-effects model

Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Recent works have shown an interest in investigating the frequentist asymptotic properties of Bayesian procedures for high-dimensional linear models under sparsity constraints. However, there exists a gap in the literature regarding analogous theoretical findings for non-linear models within the high-dimensional setting. The current study provides a novel contribution, focusing specifically on a non-linear mixed-effects model. In this model, the residual variance is assumed to be known, while the regression vector and the covariance matrix of the random effects are unknown and must be estimated. The prior distribution for the sparse regression coefficients consists of a mixture of a point mass at zero and a Laplace distribution, while an Inverse-Wishart prior is employed for the covariance parameter of the random effects. First, the effective dimension of this model is bounded with high posterior probabilities. Subsequently, we derive posterior contraction rates for both the covariance parameter and the prediction term of the response vector. Finally, under additional assumptions, the posterior distribution is shown to contract for recovery of the unknown sparse regression vector at a rate similar to that established in the linear case.

Title:
Dynamic Facility Location under Cumulative Customer Demand
Warley Almeida Silva, Margarida Carvalho, Sanjay Dominik Jena
Comments:
42 pages, 10 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Dynamic facility location problems aim at placing one or more valuable resources over a planning horizon to meet customer demand. Existing literature commonly assumes that customer demand quantities are defined independently for each time period. In many planning contexts, however, unmet demand carries over to future time periods. Unmet demand at some time periods may therefore affect decisions of subsequent time periods. This work studies a novel location problem, where the decision maker places facilities over time to capture cumulative customer demand. We propose two mixed-integer programming formulations for this problem, and show that one of them has a tighter continuous relaxation and allows the representation of more general customer demand behaviour. We characterize the computational complexity for this problem, and analyze which problem characteristics result in NP-hardness. We then propose an exact branch-and-Benders-cut method, and show that this method is approximately five times faster, on average, than solving the tighter formulation directly in our computational experiments. Our results also quantify the benefit of accounting for cumulative customer demand within the optimization framework, since the corresponding planning solutions perform much better than those obtained by ignoring cumulative demand or employing myopic heuristics. We also draw managerial insights on the quality of service perceived by customers when the provider places facilities under cumulative customer demand.

GN-SINDy: Greedy Sampling Neural Network in Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations
Ali Forootani, Harshit Kapadia, Sridhar Chellappa, Pawan Goyal, Peter Benner
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) is a data-driven technique employed for uncovering and representing the fundamental dynamics of intricate systems based on observational data. However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery

Title:
Chordal-NMF with Riemannian Multiplicative Update
Flavia Esposito, Andersen Ang
Comments:
25 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is the problem of approximating a given nonnegative matrix M through the product of two nonnegative low-rank matrices W and H. Traditionally NMF is tackled by optimizing a specific objective function evaluating the quality of the approximation. This assessment is often done based on the Frobenius norm (F-norm). In this work, we argue that the F-norm, as the ``point-to-point'' distance, may not always be appropriate. Viewing from the perspective of cone, NMF may not naturally align with F-norm. So, a ray-to-ray chordal distance is proposed as an alternative way of measuring the quality of the approximation. As this measure corresponds to the Euclidean distance on the sphere, it motivates the use of manifold optimization techniques. We apply Riemannian optimization technique to solve chordal-NMF by casting it on a manifold. Unlike works on Riemannian optimization that require the manifold to be smooth, the nonnegativity in chordal-NMF defines a non-differentiable manifold. We propose a Riemannian Multiplicative Update (RMU), and showcase the effectiveness of the chordal-NMF on synthetic and real-world datasets.

A structure-preserving relaxation Crank-Nicolson finite element method for the Schrödinger-Poisson equation
Huini Liu, Nianyu Yi, Peimeng Yin
Comments:
30 pages, 10 figures
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we propose a mass- and modified energy-conservative relaxation Crank-Nicolson finite element method for the Schrödinger-Poisson equation. Utilizing only a single auxiliary variable, we simultaneously reformulate the distinct nonlinear terms present in both the Schrödinger equation and the Poisson equation into their equivalent expressions, constructing a system equivalent to the original Schrödinger-Poisson equation. Our proposed scheme, derived from this equivalent system, is implemented linearly, avoiding the need for iterative techniques to solve the nonlinear equation. Additionally, it is executed sequentially, eliminating the need to solve a coupled large linear system. We in turn rigorously derive the optimal error estimates for the proposed scheme, demonstrating second order accuracy in time and $(k+1)$th order accuracy in space when employing polynomials of degree up to $k$. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method and emphasize its conservation properties over long-time simulations.

Sharing tea on a graph

Comments:
18 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Probability (math.PR)
Motivated by the analysis of consensus formation in the Deffuant model for social interaction, we consider the following procedure on a graph $G$. Initially, there is one unit of tea at a fixed vertex $r \in V(G)$, and all other vertices have no tea. At any time in the procedure, we can choose a connected subset of vertices $T$ and equalize the amount of tea among vertices in $T$. We prove that if $x \in V(G)$ is at distance $d$ from $r$, then $x$ will have at most $\frac{1}{d+1}$ units of tea during any step of the procedure. This bound is best possible and answers a question of Gantert.
We also consider arbitrary initial weight distributions. For every finite graph $G$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$, we prove that the set of weight distributions reachable from $w$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$.

We show that in the $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ case these maps can realize translations of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules geometrically. The motivation is to investigate translations of locally analytic representations under the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence.

And we assume the coefficients $a^{ij}$ are only measurable in $t$ and satisfy the vanishing mean oscillation in space variables. We establish a global priori estimates of $\nabla_x^u$, $( -\Delta_y )^{1/3} u$ and $( -\Delta_z )^{1/5} u$ in $L^p$ space which extend the work of Dong and Yastrzhembskiy \cite{ref49} where they focus on the 3 different scalings KFP operator. Moreover we establish a kind of Poincare inequality for homogeneous equations.

On adaptive stochastic extended iterative methods for solving least squares

Comments:

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive stochastic extended iterative method, which can be viewed as an improved extension of the randomized extended Kaczmarz (REK) method, for finding the unique minimum Euclidean norm least-squares solution of a given linear system. In particular, we introduce three equivalent stochastic reformulations of the linear least-squares problem: stochastic unconstrained and constrained optimization problems, and the stochastic multiobjective optimization problem. We then alternately employ the adaptive variants of the stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHBM) method, which utilize iterative information to update the parameters, to solve the stochastic reformulations. We prove that our method converges $R$-linearly in expectation, addressing an open problem in the literature related to designing theoretically supported adaptive SHBM methods. Numerical experiments show that our adaptive stochastic extended iterative method has strong advantages over the non-adaptive one.

A pair $(A,\mathbf{b})$ of a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be $\textit{infinitely badly approximable}$ if \[ \liminf_{\mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{Z}^n, \|\mathbf{q}\|\to\infty} \|\mathbf{q}\|^{\frac{n}{m}}\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{b}\|_{\mathbb{Z}} =\infty, \] where $\|\cdot\|_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the distance from the nearest integer vector. In this article, we introduce a novel concept of singularity for $(A,\mathbf{b})$ and characterize the infinitely badly approximable property by this singular property. As an application, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the infinitely badly approximable set. We also discuss dynamical interpretations on the space of grids in $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$.

Bilevel optimization, a well-established field for modeling hierarchical decision-making problems, has recently intersected with sustainability studies and practices, resulting in a series of works focusing on bilevel optimization problems involving multiple decision makers with diverse economic, environmental, and social objectives. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of sustainable bilevel optimization applications. First, we introduce the main concepts related to the nature of bilevel optimization problems and present some typical mathematical formulations for bilevel pricing problems that cover many of the collected applications. Then, we review the most relevant works published in sustainable bilevel optimization, giving a classification based on the application domains and their association with well-known operations research problems, while briefly discussing the proposed solution methodologies. We survey applications on transportation and logistics, production planning and manufacturing, water, waste, and agriculture management, supply chains, and disaster prevention and response. Finally, we outline a list of open questions and opportunities for future research in this domain.

On existence of weak solutions to a Baer-Nunziato type system
Martin Kalousek, Šárka Nečasová
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, a dissipative version of a compressible one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for a mixture of two compressible heat conducting gases is considered. The complete existence proof for weak solutions to this system was addressed as an open problem in [6, Section 5]. The purpose of this paper is to prove the global in time existence of weak solutions to the one velocity Baer--Nunziato type system for arbitrary large initial data. The goal is achieved in three steps. Firstly, the given system is transformed into a new one which possesses the "Navier-Stokes-Fourier" structure. Secondly, the new system is solved by an adaptation of the Feireisl--Lions approach for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. Eventually, the existence of a weak solution to the original one velocity Baer--Nunziato system using the almost uniqueness property of renormalized solutions to pure transport equations.

Numerous renowned algorithms for tackling the compressed sensing problem employ an alternating strategy, which typically involves data matching in one module and denoising in another. Based on an in-depth analysis of the connection between the message passing and operator splitting, we present a novel approach, the Alternating Subspace Method (ASM), which integrates the principles of the greedy methods (e.g., the orthogonal matching pursuit type methods) and the splitting methods (e.g., the approximate message passing type methods). Essentially, ASM enhances the splitting method by achieving fidelity in a subspace-restricted fashion. We reveal that such confining strategy still yields a consistent fixed point iteration and establish its local geometric convergence on the LASSO problem. Numerical experiments on the LASSO, channel estimation, and dynamic compressed sensing problems demonstrate its high convergence rate and its capacity to incorporate different prior distributions. Overall, the proposed method is promising in efficiency, accuracy and flexibility, which has the potential to be competitive in different sparse recovery applications.

Error estimates of physics-informed neural networks for approximating Boltzmann equation

Motivated by the recent successful application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve Boltzmann-type equations [S. Jin, Z. Ma, and K. Wu, J. Sci. Comput., 94 (2023), pp. 57], we provide a rigorous error analysis for PINNs in approximating the solution of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian. The challenge arises from the nonlocal quadratic interaction term defined in the unbounded domain of velocity space. Analyzing this term on an unbounded domain requires the inclusion of a truncation function, which demands delicate analysis techniques. As a generalization of this analysis, we also provide proof of the asymptotic preserving property when using micro-macro decomposition-based neural networks.

Given a set $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, consider the sequences $\{d_n(I)\},\{p_n(I)\}$ where for any $n$, $d_n(I)$ and $p_n(I)$ respectively count the number of permutations in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ whose descent set (respectively peak set) is $I \cap [n-1]$. We investigate the growth rates $\text{gr} \ d_n(I) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(d_n(I)/n!\right)^{1/n}$ and $\text{gr} \ p_n(I) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(p_n(I)/n!\right)^{1/n}$ over all $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Our main contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we prove that the numbers $\text{gr} \ d_n(I)$ over all $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ are exactly the interval $\left[0,2/\pi\right]$. To do so, we construct an algorithm that explicitly builds $I$ for any desired limit $L$ in the interval. Secondly, we prove that the numbers $\text{gr} \ p_n(I)$ for periodic sets $I \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ form a dense set in $\left[0,1/\sqrt[3]{3}\right]$. We do this by explicitly finding, for any prescribed $L$ in the interval, a set $I$ whose corresponding growth rate is arbitrarily close to $L$.

Modified Macdonald polynomials and mu-Mahonian statistics
Emma Yu Jin, Xiaowei Lin
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The Haglund--Haiman--Loehr theorem provides the following combinatorial formula for the modified Macdonald polynomials: $$\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma: \mu\rightarrow \mathbb{P}}x^{\sigma}t^{maj(\sigma)}q^{inv(\sigma)}.$$ Inspired by Martin's multiline-queue formula for the stationary distribution of multitype asymmetric simple exclusion processes, Corteel, Haglund, Mandelshtam, Mason and Williams recently introduced the queue inversion statistic $quinv$ and conjectured that the tableaux formula for $\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)$ is invariant if the inversion statistic $inv$ is replaced by $quinv$. This was subsequently resolved by Ayyer, Mandelshtam and Martin, who proposed a stronger conjecture on the equivalence of the two refined formulas for $\tilde{H}_{\mu}(X;q,t)$.
Our main result confirms this Ayyer--Mandelshtam--Martin conjecture. We establish an equidistribution between the pairs $(inv,maj)$ and $(quinv,maj)$ of $\mu$-Mahonian statistics on any row-equivalency class $[\tau]$, where $\tau$ is a filling of the Young diagram of $\mu$. As a byproduct of our approach, we show that if $\tau$ is a rectangular filling, the triples $(inv,quinv,maj)$ and $(quinv,inv,maj)$ have the same distribution over $[\tau]$.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
This paper introduces the Non-homogeneous Generalized Skellam process (NGSP) and its fractional version NGFSP by time changing it with an independent inverse stable subordinator. We study distributional properties for NGSP and NGFSP including probability generating function, probability mass function (p.m.f.), factorial moments, mean, variance, covariance and correlation structure. Then we investigate the long and short range dependence structures for NGSP and NGFSP, and obtain the governing state differential equations of these processes along with their increment processes. We obtain recurrence relations satisfied by the state probabilities of Non-homogeneous generalized counting process (NGCP), NGSP and NGFSP. The weighted sum representations for these processes are provided. We further obtain martingale and renewal properties along with arrival time distribution for NGSP and NGFSP. An alternative version of NGFSP with a closed-form p.m.f. is introduced along with a discussion of its distributional and asymptotic properties. In addition, we study the running average processes of GCP and GSP which are of independent interest. The p.m.f. of NGSP and the simulated sample paths of GFSP, NGFSP and related processes are plotted. Finally, we discuss an application to a high-frequency financial data set pointing out the advantages of our model compared to existing ones.

We introduce a diffuse-interface Landau-de Gennes free energy for nematic liquid crystals (NLC) systems, with free boundaries, in three dimensions submerged in isotropic liquid, and a phase field is introduced to model the deformable interface. The energy consists of the original Landau-de Gennes free energy, three penalty terms and a volume constraint. We prove the existence and regularity of minimizers for the diffuse-interface energy functional. We also prove a uniform maximum principle of the minimizer under appropriate assumptions, together with a uniqueness result for small domains. Then, we establish a sharp-interface limit where minimizers of the diffuse-interface energy converge to a minimizer of a sharp-interface energy using methods from $\Gamma$-convergence. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments with the diffuse-interface model and the findings are compared with existing works.

For Schrödinger operators $H_V=-\Delta_g+V$ with critically singular potentials $V$ on compact manifolds, we prove sharp estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to submanifolds. Our method refines the perturbative argument by Blair-Sire-Sogge and enables us to deal with submanifolds of all codimensions. As applications, we obtain improved estimates on negatively curved manifolds and flat tori. In particular, we extend the uniform $L^2$ restriction estimates on flat tori by Bourgain-Rudnick to singular potentials.

This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by this http URL, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.

Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups

Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR); Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $G$ be a group. The co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x,{}_k y]\neq1$ and $[y,{}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$, where $[x,{}_ky]$ is the iterated commutator $[x,y,y,\ldots,y]$, with $k$ terms $y$ in the expression; usually we delete isolated vertices (these are the left Engel elements).
This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi~\cite{aa}. However, we argue that it is more naturally called the ``co-Engel graph''.
We compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of co-Engel graphs for groups including the dihedral and generalized quaternion groups and nonabelian groups of order $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number of the co-Engel is at most $4$ and the graph is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that the co-Engel graph is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{č}evi{ć} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.
We also look briefly at the directed Engel graph, with an arc $x\to y$ if $[y,{}_kx]=1$ for some $k$. We show that, if $G$ is a finite soluble group, this graph either is the complete directed graph (which occurs only if $G$ is nilpotent), or has pairs of vertices joined only by single arcs. We also show that the (directed or undirected) Engel graph of a group $G$ is the lexicographic product of a complete graph of order $Z_\infty(G)$ by the (directed or undirected) Engel graph of $G/Z_\infty(G)$, where $Z_\infty(G)$ is the hypercenter of $G$.

Vibrational Control of Complex Networks

Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The stability of complex networks, from power grids to biological systems, is crucial for their proper functioning. It is thus important to control such systems to maintain or restore their stability. Traditional approaches rely on real-time state measurements for feedback control, but this can be challenging in many real-world systems, such as the brain, due to their complex and dynamic nature. This paper utilizes vibrational control -- an open-loop strategy -- to regulate network stability. Unlike conventional methods targeting network nodes, our approach focuses on manipulating network edges through vibrational inputs. We establish sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for vibration-induced functional modifications of network edges and stabilization of network systems as a whole. Additionally, we provide methods for designing effective vibrational control inputs and validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.

An inexact golden ratio primal-dual algorithm with linesearch step for a saddle point problem
Changjie Fang, Jinxiu Liu, Jingtao Qiu, Shenglan Chen
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we propose an inexact golden ratio primal-dual algorithm with linesearch step(IP-GRPDAL) for solving the saddle point problems, where two subproblems can be approximately solved by applying the notations of inexact extended proximal operators with matrix norm. Our proposed IP-GRPDAL method allows for larger stepsizes by replacing the extrapolation step with a convex combination step. Each iteration of the linesearch requires to update only the dual variable, and hence it is quite cheap. In addition, we prove convergence of the proposed algorithm and show an O(1/N) ergodic convergence rate for our algorithm, where N represents the number of iterations. When one of the component functions is strongly convex, the accelerated O(1/N2) convergence rate results are established by choosing adaptively some algorithmic parameters. Furthermore, when both component functions are strongy convex, the linear convergence rate results are achieved. Numerical simulation results on the sparse recovery and image deblurring problems illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of our inexact algorithms.

Factorizations and minimality of the Calkin Algebra norm for $C(K)$-spaces
Antonio Acuaviva
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
For a scattered, locally compact Hausdorff space $K$, we prove that the essential norm on the Calkin algebra \break $\mathscr{B}(C_0(K))/\mathscr{K}(C_0(K))$ is a minimal algebra norm. The proof relies on establishing a quantitative factorization for the identity operator on $c_0$ through non-compact operators $T: C_0(K) \to X$, where $X$ is any Banach space that does not contain a copy of $\ell_1$ or whose dual unit ball is weak$^*$ sequentially compact. It follows that, for every ordinal $\alpha$, the algebras $\mathscr{B}(C[0,\alpha]))$ and $\mathscr{B}(C[0,\alpha]))/\mathscr{K}(C[0,\alpha]))$ have an unique algebra norm.

Advancing Strategic Planning and Dynamic Control of Complex Projects
L. G. Teuber, H. J. van Heukelum, A. R. M. Wolfert
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Strategic project planning and dynamic control are essential to ensure that complex projects are both prepared and executed best-fit-for-common-purpose, guided by three interrelated strategies: (1) Agreeing First, (2) Acting Feasibly, and (3) Adapting Flexibly. When these strategies become too complex for humans to fully conceive and manage, effective computer-aided decision support becomes crucial. However, standard simulation-driven evaluation and a-posteriori decision-making are typically single-sided and technically focused focus, rather than applying a combined simulation-and-optimisation approach that a-priori integrates stakeholder interests and their mitigation behavior. Moreover, current planning and control methodologies often lack robust stochastic representations and associative multi objective optimisation methods that capture the full socio-technical complexity while maximizing the potential within reach. This paper introduces Odycon (Open Design and Dynamic Control), a new purpose-driven project management methodology that provides an actionable solution to these challenges. It presents a generic mathematical framework for project planning and control that integrates stakeholder preferences (human domain) with system performances (physical domain), enabling more effective planning and dynamic control. Odycon integrates standard Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with the novel Integrative Maximisation of Aggregated Preferences (IMAP) optimisation method to develop a best-fit strategic plan and the most effective mitigation control strategies. Its value is demonstrated through applications in offshore wind installation and highway infrastructure projects, showcasing advances in associative design and decision-making, and aiming for a best-fit-for-common-purpose synthesis across different complex project phases.

Periodicity of tiles in finite Abelian groups

Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR); Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In this paper, we introduce the periodic tiling (PT) property for finite abelian groups. A finite abelian group is said to have the PT property if every non-periodic set that tiles the group by translation admits a periodic tiling complement. This notion extends the scope beyond groups with the Hajós property. We give a complete classification of cyclic groups possessing the PT property and identify certain non-cyclic groups that enjoy the PT property but fail to satisfy the Hajós property.. As a byproduct, we obtain new families of groups for which the implication ``Tile $\Longrightarrow$ Spectral" holds. Furthermore, for elementary $p$-groups with the PT property, by analyzing the structure of tiles, we prove that every tile is a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some subgroup.

Flow of the zeros of polynomials under iterated differentiation

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)
For a monic polynomial $Q_n$ of degree $n$, let $Q_{n, k}$ be its $k$-th derivative normalized to be monic. Under the only assumption that the sequence $\{Q_n\}$ has a weak* limiting zero distribution (an empirical distribution of zeros) represented by a probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, we show that as $n, k \rightarrow \infty$ such that $k / n \rightarrow t \in(0,1)$, the Cauchy transform of the normalized zero-counting measure of the polynomials $Q_{n, k}$ converges in a neighborhood of infinity to an analytic function, uniquely determined by $\mu_0$ and $t$, that can be written as the Cauchy transform of a measure $\mu_t$, not necessarily uniquely determined unless $\mu_0$ is supported on the real line.
The family of these Cauchy transforms and, when well defined, the corresponding measures $\mu_t $, $t \in(0,1)$, whose dependence on the parameter $t$ can be interpreted as a flow of the zeros under iterated differentiation, has several interesting connections with the inviscid Burgers equation, the fractional free convolution of $\mu_0$, or a nonlocal diffusion equation governing the density of $\mu_t$ on $\mathbb R$.
We provide an elementary and unified approach that not only recovers, but also explains various phenomena observed in prior works - from Burgers-type PDEs to free probability limits.

We study linear versions of Reedy categories in relation with finite dimensional algebras and abelian model structures. We prove that, for a linear Reedy category $\mathcal{C}$ over a field, the category of left $\mathcal{C}$--modules admits a highest weight structure, which in case $\mathcal{C}$ is finite corresponds to a quasi-hereditary algebra with an exact Borel subalgebra. We also lift complete cotorsion pairs and abelian model structures to certain categories of additive functors indexed by linear Reedy categories, generalizing analogous results from the hereditary case.

Quaternion tensor low rank Quaternion tensor low-rank approximation using a family of non-convex norms

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we propose a new approaches for low rank approximation of quaternion tensors \cite{chen2019low,zhang1997quaternions,hamilton1866elements}. The first method uses quasi-norms to approximate the tensor by a low-rank tensor using the QT-product \cite{miao2023quaternion}, which generalizes the known L-product to N-mode quaternions. The second method involves Non-Convex norms to approximate the Tucker and TT-rank for the completion problem. We demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively approximate the tensor compared to the convexifying of the rank, such as the nuclear norm. We provide theoretical results and numerical experiments to show the efficiency of the proposed methods in the Inpainting and Denoising applications.

Global axisymmetric solutions for Navier-Stokes equation with rotation uniformly in the inviscid limit

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We prove that the solutions to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation with constant rotation exist globally for small axisymmetric initial data, where the smallness is uniform with respect to the viscosity $\nu \in [0,\infty)$. This expands the work by Guo, Pausader, and Widmayer \cite{GPW} which showed the global axisymmetric stability of rotation for 3D incompressible Euler's equation, to the viscous case, but for a single threshold that works for arbitrary viscosity. This is achieved by suitably adapting the dispersive framework established in \cite{GPW} to the Navier-Stokes setting.

We obtain inequalities involving the entropy of a positive integer and the divergence of two positive integers, respectively the entropy of an ideal and the divergence of two ideals in a ring of algebraic integers. Among the important results, we show that the minimal entropy arises for sharp localization, and the maximal entropy occurs for equidistribution. We also study other interesting estimates of entropy and divergence for numbers and for ideals. Finally, we determine the entropies of probability distributions on infinite trees of Schur {\sigma}-groups, which are realized by 3-class field tower groups of imaginary quadratic number fields.

Persistent Khovanov homology of tangles
Jian Liu, Li Shen, Guo-Wei Wei
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Knot data analysis (KDA), which studies data with curve-type structures such as knots, links, and tangles, has emerging as a promising geometric topology approach in data science. While evolutionary Khovanov homology has been developed to analyze the global persistent topological features of links, it has limitations in capturing the local topological characteristics of knots and links. To address this challenge, we introduce the persistent Khovanov homology of tangles, providing a new mathematical framework for characterizing local features in curve-type data. While tangle homology is inherently abstract, we provide a concrete functor which maps the category of tangles to the category of modules, enabling the computation of tangle homology. Additionally, we employ planar algebra to construct a category of tangles without invoking fixed boundaries, thereby giving rise to a persistent Khovanov homology functor that enables practical applications. This framework provides a theoretical foundation and practical strategies for the topological analysis of curve-type data.

Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.

How many points converge to a heteroclinic network in an aperiodic way?
Christian Bick, Alexander Lohse
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Homoclinic and heteroclinic connections can form cycles and networks in phase space, which organize global phenomena in dynamical systems. On the one hand, stability notions for (omni)cycles give insight into how many initial conditions approach the network along a single given (omni)cycle. On the other hand, the term switching is used to describe situations where there are trajectories that follow any possible sequence of heteroclinic connections along the network. Here we give a notion of asymptotic stability for general sequences along a network of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. We show that there cannot be uncountably many aperiodic sequences that attract a set with nontrivial measure. Finally, we discuss examples where one may or may not expect aperiodic convergence towards a network and conclude with some open questions.

The Conjugacy Ratio of Abelian-by-Cyclic Groups

Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
Let $G = K \rtimes \langle t \rangle $ be a finitely generated group where $K$ is abelian and $\langle t\rangle$ is the infinite cyclic group. Let $ R $ be a finite symmetric subset of $K$ such that $S = \{ (r,1),(0,t^{\pm 1}) \mid r \in R \}$ is a generating set of $G$. We prove that the spherical conjugacy ratio, and hence the conjugacy ratio, of $G$ with respect to $S$ is $0$ unless $G$ is virtually abelian, confirming a conjecture of Ciobanu, Cox and Martino in this case. We also show that the Baumslag--Solitar group $\mathrm{BS}(1,2)$ has a one-sided Følner sequence $F$ such that the conjugacy ratio with respect to $F$ is non-zero, even though $\mathrm{BS}(1,2)$ is not virtually abelian. This is in contrast to two-sided Følner sequences, where Tointon showed that the conjugacy ratio with respect to a two-sided Følner sequence is positive if and only if the group is virtually abelian.

We extend the Wirtinger number of links, an invariant originally defined by Blair, Kjuchukova, Velazquez, and Villanueva in terms of extending initial colorings of some strands of a diagram to the entire diagram, to spatial graphs. We prove that the Wirtinger number equals the bridge index of spatial graphs, and we implement an algorithm in Python which gives a more efficient way to estimate upper bounds of bridge indices. Combined with lower bounds from diagram colorings by elements from certain algebraic structures and clasping techniques, we obtain exact bridge indices for a large family of almost unknotted spatial graphs. We also show that for every possible negative Euler characteristic, there exist almost unknotted graphs of arbitrarily large bridge index.

Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations

Subjects:

Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem.
In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.

Measure-to-measure interpolation using Transformers

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Transformers are deep neural network architectures that underpin the recent successes of large language models. Unlike more classical architectures that can be viewed as point-to-point maps, a Transformer acts as a measure-to-measure map implemented as specific interacting particle system on the unit sphere: the input is the empirical measure of tokens in a prompt and its evolution is governed by the continuity equation. In fact, Transformers are not limited to empirical measures and can in principle process any input measure. As the nature of data processed by Transformers is expanding rapidly, it is important to investigate their expressive power as maps from an arbitrary measure to another arbitrary measure. To that end, we provide an explicit choice of parameters that allows a single Transformer to match $N$ arbitrary input measures to $N$ arbitrary target measures, under the minimal assumption that every pair of input-target measures can be matched by some transport map.

Subjects:

This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we present the classical exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm for solving the MLE problem, which suffers from numerical instability when applied to correlated channels. We propose a computationally efficient inexact CD algorithm by approximating the objective function, which approximately solves the one-dimensional subproblem and improves both computational efficiency and numerical stability. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Finally, we study the MLE model in the joint device activity and data detection context. Simulation results demonstrate the computational performance of the presented algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.

This work concerns a construction of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences from right to left we call the generating tree growing on the left. We first apply this construction to inversion sequences avoiding 201 and 210, resulting in a new way of computing their generating function. We then use a slightly modified construction to compute the generating function of inversion sequences avoiding 010 and 102, which was only conjectured before. These generating functions are algebraic in both instances. We end by discussing how the generating tree growing on the left can be applied in a more general setting.

Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha > 2 D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D +1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha>0$, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.

Leveraging the two-timescale strategy, we construct a Lyapunov function and establish the sub-linear convergence of Two-timescale EXTRA to a consensual first-order stationary point. Additionally, we introduce an off-line sequential method for algorithm parameter selection, and the numerical results support the theoretical guarantees.

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, available adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been reported to scale poorly in terms of computational cost when applied to high-dimensional problems. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). PACMANN incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the PINN loss function, that is, the squared PDE residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration into existing physics-informed neural network pipelines. The code is available at this https URL.

Title:
Flattening and algebrisation
Michael McQuillan
Comments:
Numerous fixes, including taking account of the somewhere dense components of the flatifier, the necessity for which was pointed out to me by David Rydh. A useful application to contration/surjectivity of formal schemes and further foundational material (appendix) have been added
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Commutative Algebra (math.AC)
To, say, a proper algebraic or holomorphic space $X/S$, and a coherent sheaf ${\mathcal F}$ on $X$ we identify a functorial ideal, the fitted flatifier, blowing up sequentially in which leads to a flattening of the proper transform of ${\mathcal F}$. As such, this is a variant on theorems of Raynaud \& Hironaka, but it's functorial nature allows its application to a flattening theorem for formal algebraic spaces or Artin champs, where we apply it to prove close to optimal algebraisation theorems for formal deformations. En passant, contrary to what is asserted in EGA-3 Remarque 5.4.6, we give an example of an adic Noetherian formal scheme whose nil radical is not coherent and establish the equivalence conjectured therein between arbitrary algebraisability and that of the reduction.

We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.

Legendrian non-squeezing via microsheaves

Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)
We show that Legendrian pre-quantization lifts of many non-exact Lagrangian submanifolds in $\mathbb{C}^n$ retain some quantitative rigidity from the symplectic base. In particular, they cannot be moved by Legendrian isotopy into an arbitrarily small pre-quantized cylinder. This is a high dimensional generalization of results of Dimitroglou Rizell--Sullivan in dimension 3. In this setting, we give a new proof of non-squeezing using normal rulings, and in high dimension, we obtain our results using a category of (micro)sheaves associated to a Legendrian submanifold of pre-quantizations.

Rectangular Recurrence Relations in $\mathfrak{gl}_{n}$ and $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ Invariant Integrable Models

A new method is introduced to derive general recurrence relations for off-shell Bethe vectors in quantum integrable models with either type $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ or type $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ symmetries. These recurrence relations describe how to add a single parameter $z$ to specific subsets of Bethe parameters, expressing the resulting Bethe vector as a linear combination of monodromy matrix entries that act on Bethe vectors which do not depend on $z$. We refer to these recurrence relations as rectangular because the monodromy matrix entries involved are drawn from the upper-right rectangular part of the matrix. This construction is achieved within the framework of the zero mode method.

W-algebras, Gaussian Free Fields and $\mathfrak{g}$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals
Baptiste Cerclé
Comments:

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR); Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.

On the Maximum and Minimum of a Multivariate Poisson Distribution
Zheng Liu, Feifan Shi, Jing Yao, Yang Yang
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In this paper, we investigate the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the maximum and minimum of multivariate Poisson distributions with three dependence structures, namely, the common shock, comonotonic shock and thinning-dependence models. In particular, we formulate the definition of a thinning-dependent multivariate Poisson distribution based on Wang and Yuen (2005). We derive explicit CDFs of the maximum and minimum of the multivariate Poisson random vectors and conduct asymptotic analyses on them. Our results reveal the substantial difference between the three dependence structures for multivariate Poisson distribution and may suggest an alternative method for studying the dependence for other multivariate distributions. We further provide numerical examples demonstrating obtained results.

Subjects:

In this paper we develop a systematic calculus for the Duistermaat index, a symplectic invariant defined for triples of Lagrangian subspaces. Introduced nearly half a century ago, this index has lately been the subject of renewed attention, due to its central role in eigenvalue interlacing problems on quantum graphs (and more abstractly for self-adjoint extensions of symmetric operators). Here we give an axiomatic characterization of the index that leads to elementary proofs of its fundamental properties. We also relate the index to other quantities often appearing in symplectic geometry, such as the Hörmander--Kashiwara--Wall index and the Maslov index. Among other things, this leads to a curious formula for the Morse index of a difference of Hermitian matrices.

Solving Partial Differential Equations with Random Feature Models

Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Machine learning based partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers have received great attention in recent years. Most progress in this area has been driven by deep neural networks such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and kernel method. In this paper, we introduce a random feature based framework toward efficiently solving PDEs. Random feature method was originally proposed to approximate large-scale kernel machines and can be viewed as a shallow neural network as well. We provide an error analysis for our proposed method along with comprehensive numerical results on several PDE benchmarks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art solvers that face challenges with a large number of collocation points, our proposed method reduces the computational complexity. Moreover, the implementation of our method is simple and does not require additional computational resources. Due to the theoretical guarantee and advantages in computation, our approach is proven to be efficient for solving PDEs.

Towards a Theory of SIC-like Phenomena: Regular Bouquets and Generalised Heisenberg Groups
David Solomon
Comments:
41 pages. This revised version contains various minor changes, corrections and additions
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We lay the foundations for a broad algebraic theory encompassing SICs in the hope of elucidating their heuristic connections with Stark units. What emerges is a greatly generalised set-up with added structure and potential for applications in other areas. Let $A$ and $B$ be finite modules for a commutative ring $R$, $C$ a finite abelian group and $\lambda: A\times B\rightarrow C$ an $R$-balanced bilinear pairing. The main constructs are the generalised Heisenberg group ${\cal H}={\cal H}(A,B,C,\lambda)$ attached to these data (an abstract central extension of $A\oplus B$ by $C$) which plays the role of the Weyl-Heisenberg group in SIC theory, together with its canonical, unitary Schrödinger representations. The SIC itself is replaced by an ${\cal H}$-orbit of complex lines in the representation space, termed a `bouquet'. The overlaps of the SIC are interpreted as a map from ${\cal H}/Z({\cal H})$ into $\mathbb C$ whose absolute values are the Hermitian `angles' between the lines in the bouquet. We also introduce a regularity condition on bouquets in terms of the angle-map, intended to weaken the equiangularity condition of SICs. At the same time, it allows the incorporation of the $R$-structure via the abstract automorphism group of ${\cal H}$ which in turn generalises the Clifford group of SIC theory via its associated Weil representation. As well as several subsidiary definitions and `structural' results, we prove a new `clinometric relation' for the angle-map, determine the structure of the automorphism group and introduce a large class of examples of arithmetic origin, derived from the trace-pairing on quotients of fractional ideals in an arbitrary number field, which we investigate in greater detail.

On finite dimensional regular gradings

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
Let $A$ be an associative algebra over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic 0. A decomposition $A=A_1\oplus\cdots \oplus A_r$ of $A$ into a direct sum of $r$ vector subspaces is called a \textsl{regular decomposition} if, for every $n$ and every $1\le i_j\le r$, there exist $a_{i_j}\in A_{i_j}$ such that $a_{i_1}\cdots a_{i_n}\ne 0$, and moreover, for every $1\le i,j\le r$ there exists a constant $\beta(i,j)\in K^*$ such that $a_ia_j=\beta(i,j)a_ja_i$ for every $a_i\in A_i$, $a_j\in A_j$. We work with decompositions determined by gradings on $A$ by a finite abelian group $G$. In this case, the function $\beta\colon G\times G\to K^*$ ought to be a bicharacter. A regular decomposition is {minimal} whenever for every $g$, $h\in G$, the equalities $\beta(x,g)=\beta(x,h)$ for every $x\in G$ imply $g=h$. In this paper we describe the finite dimensional algebras $A$ (with unit) admitting a $G$-grading such that the corresponding regular decomposition is minimal. Moreover we compute the graded codimension sequence of these algebras assuming complete support. It turns out that the graded PI exponent of every finite dimensional $G$-graded algebra with regular grading such that its regular decomposition is minimal and it has complete support, coincides with its ordinary (ungraded) PI exponent. Finally we have shown that the regular decomposition of a finite dimensional regular $G$-grading $A$ is minimal if and only if $\exp(A)=|G|$.

In this paper, we consider a generalization of cooperative games to the case where a coalition can distribute the earned utility not only among its members but also to other players. In particular, we consider an example where coalitions are required to share their winnings with non-contributing players. For these generalized games, we also provide an analogue of Scarf's theorem. It turns out that in this generalization, the existence of a non-empty core is closely related to a homotopy invariant of covers defined by the cooperative game.

Semiparametrics via parametrics and contiguity
Adam Lee, Emil A. Stoltenberg, Per A. Mykland
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Econometrics (econ.EM); Methodology (stat.ME)
Inference on the parametric part of a semiparametric model is no trivial task. If one approximates the infinite dimensional part of the semiparametric model by a parametric function, one obtains a parametric model that is in some sense close to the semiparametric model and inference may proceed by the method of maximum likelihood. Under regularity conditions, the ensuing maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically normal and efficient in the approximating parametric model. Thus one obtains a sequence of asymptotically normal and efficient estimators in a sequence of growing parametric models that approximate the semiparametric model and, intuitively, the limiting 'semiparametric' estimator should be asymptotically normal and efficient as well. In this paper we make this intuition rigorous: we move much of the semiparametric analysis back into classical parametric terrain, and then translate our parametric results back to the semiparametric world by way of contiguity. Our approach departs from the conventional sieve literature by being more specific about the approximating parametric models, by working not only with but also under these when treating the parametric models, and by taking full advantage of the mutual contiguity that we require between the parametric and semiparametric models. We illustrate our theory with two canonical examples of semiparametric models, namely the partially linear regression model and the Cox regression model. An upshot of our theory is a new, relatively simple, and rather parametric proof of the efficiency of the Cox partial likelihood estimator.

Improved bound on the number of cycle sets
Rajko Nenadov
Comments:
11 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
The cycle set of a graph $G$ is the set consisting of all sizes of cycles in $G$. Answering a conjecture of Erdős and Faudree, Verstraëte showed that there are at most $2^{n - n^{1/10}}$ different cycle sets of graphs with $n$ vertices. We improve this bound to $2^{n - n^{1/2 - o(1)}}$. Our proof follows the general strategy of Verstraëte of reducing the problem to counting cycle sets of Hamiltonian graphs with many chords or a large maximum degree. The key new ingredients are near-optimal container lemmata for cycle sets of such graphs.

This paper presents an elementary proof of quantitative uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the Cucker--Smale model under sufficiently strong interaction. The idea is to combine existing finite-time propagation of chaos estimates with existing uniform-in-time stability estimates for the interacting particle system, in order to obtain a uniform-in-time propagation of chaos estimate with an explicit rate of convergence in the number of particles. This is achieved via a method that is similar in spirit to the classical 'stability + consistency implies convergence' approach in numerical analysis.

On a local property of infinite Galois extensions implying the Northcott property

In 2001, Bombieri and Zannier studied the Northcott property (N) for infinite Galois extensions of the rationals. In particular they provided a local property of the extensions that imply property (N). Later, Checcoli and Fehm demonstrated the existence of infinite extensions satisfying this local property. In this article, we establish two main results. First, we show that this local property, unlike property (N), is not preserved under finite extensions. Second, we show that, for an infinite Galois extension of Q, such local property cannot be read on the Galois group. More precisely, we exhibit several profinite groups that are realizable over Q by fields that do not satisfy the local property.

Multi-Symmetric Schur Functions

Subjects:

We study a multi-symmetric generalization of the classical Schur functions called the multi-symmetric Schur functions. These functions form an integral basis for the ring of multi-symmetric functions indexed by tuples of partitions and are defined as certain stable-limits of key polynomials. We prove combinatorial results about the monomial expansions of the multi-symmetric Schur functions including a diagrammatic combinatorial formula and a triangularity result which completely characterizes their monomial multi-symmetric supports. The triangularity result involves a non-trivial generalization of the dominance order on partitions to tuples of partitions. We prove, using the Demazure character formula, that the multi-symmetric Schur functions expand positively into the basis of tensor products of ordinary Schur functions and describe the expansion coefficients as multiplicities of certain irreducible representations for Levi subgroups inside particular Demazure modules. Lastly, we find a family of multi-symmetric plethystic operators related to the classical Bernstein operators which act on the multi-symmetric Schur basis by a simple recurrence relation.

Evaluating singular and near-singular integrals on $C^2$ smooth surfaces with quadratic geometric approximation and closed form expressions

48 pages, 10 figures. The appendix is 9 pages of formulas
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Most Fredholm integral equations involve integrals with weakly singular kernels. Once the domain of integration is discretized into flat triangular elements, these weakly singular kernels become strongly singular or near-singular. Common methods to compute these integrals when the kernel is a Green's function include the Duffy transform, polar coordinates with closed analytic formulas, and singularity extraction. However, these methods do not generalize well to the normal derivatives of Green's functions due to the strongly singular behavior of these functions on triangular elements. We provide methods to integrate both the Green's function and its normal derivative on smooth surfaces discretized by triangular elements in three dimensions for many commonly encountered differential operators. For strongly singular integrals involving normal derivatives of Green's functions, we introduce a more refined approximation of the derivatives of the Green's function on flat triangles. This method uses geometric information of the true surface of integration to approximate the original integral on the true domain using push-forward maps. This is better than simply setting the singular integrals to zero, while being faster than adaptive refinement methods. We provide an algorithm for explicit computations on triangles, and present necessary analytic formulas that the algorithm requires in the appendix.

We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.

In this article, we identify the existence of a divisibility relationship between the number of ring homomorphisms and surjective group homomorphisms. We demonstrate that for finite cyclic structures, the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We further extend this result for finite abelian structures.

History and Overview (math.HO)
Abraham Robinson's philosophical stance has been the subject of several recent studies. Erhardt following Gaifman claims that Robinson was a finitist, and that there is a tension between his philosophical position and his actual mathematical output. We present evidence in Robinson's writing that he is more accurately described as adhering to the philosophical approach of Formalism. Furthermore, we show that Robinson explicitly argued {against} certain finitist positions in his philosophical writings. There is no tension between Robinson's mathematical work and his philosophy because mathematics and metamathematics are distinct fields: Robinson advocates finitism for metamathematics but no such restriction for mathematics. We show that Erhardt's analysis is marred by historical errors, by routine conflation of the generic and the technical meaning of several key terms, and by a philosophical {parti pris}. Robinson's Formalism remains a viable alternative to mathematical Platonism.

We develop two complementary generative mechanisms that explain when and why Benford's first-digit law arises. First, a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) ensemble induces a geometric law for code length. Maximizing its entropy under a constraint on halting length yields Benford statistics. This model shows a phase transition with respect to the halt probability. Second, a constrained partition model (Einstein-solid combinatorics) recovers the same logarithmic profile as the maximum-entropy solution under a coarse-grained entropy-rate constraint, clarifying the role of non-ergodicity (ensemble vs. trajectory averages). We also perform numerical experiments that corroborate our conclusions.

It has been known for some time that the orders in the four dimensional matrix algebra over a local field that can be written as a finite intersection of maximal orders are precisely those whose Gorenstein closure is Eichler. In this paper, a similar characterization is given for orders whose Gorenstein closure is a Bass order. A second characterization, this time for the Bass orders themselves, is given in terms of their branches, i.e., maximal subgraphs of the Bruhat-Tits tree whose vertices are orders containing them.

Dirac Operators on Orbifold Resolutions: Uniform Elliptic Theory
Viktor F. Majewski
Comments:
We have corrected some minor inaccuracies and typos
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We study Dirac operators on resolutions of Riemannian orbifolds by developing a uniform elliptic theory. The key idea is to view orbifolds as conically fibred singular (CFS) spaces and resolve them by gluing asymptotically conical fibrations (ACF) into the singular strata. This yields smooth Gromov--Hausdorff resolutions that preserve the large--scale structure of the orbifold while replacing its singularities with well--understood local models.
Dirac bundles are resolved compatibly with this construction, which allows us to analyse entire families of Dirac operators in a uniform way. Inspired by the linear gluing framework of Hutchings--Taubes, we build uniformly bounded right inverses and describe precisely how kernels and cokernels behave as the geometry degenerates. The analysis relies on weighted spaces adapted to the conically fibred, conically fibred singular and asymptotically conical fibred regions. These allow us to prove Fredholm properties, uniform bounds and to establish exactness of the linear gluing sequence. Consequently, we obtain an index formula decomposing the index into contributions from the orbifold and the ACF models. This framework provides a direct and flexible analytic approach to Dirac operators on orbifold resolutions, avoiding the full edge calculus, and setting the stage for applications to special holonomy metrics and gauge theory.

Agreement forests continue to play a central role in the comparison of phylogenetic trees since their introduction more than 25 years ago. More specifically, they are used to characterise several distances that are based on tree rearrangement operations and related quantifiers of dissimilarity between phylogenetic trees. In addition, the concept of agreement forests continues to underlie most advancements in the development of algorithms that exactly compute the aforementioned measures. In this paper, we introduce agreement digraphs, a concept that generalises agreement forests for two phylogenetic trees to two phylogenetic networks. Analogous to the way in which agreement forests compute the subtree prune and regraft distance between two phylogenetic trees but inherently more complex, we then use agreement digraphs to bound the subnet prune and regraft distance between two tree-child networks from above and below and show that our bounds are tight.

We consider the set $\mathcal M_n\left(\mathbb Z; H\right)$ of $n\times n$-matrices with integer elements of size at most $H$ and obtain and asymptotic formula on the number of matrices from $\mathcal M_n\left(\mathbb Z; H\right)$ with square-free determinants. We also use our approach with some further enhancements, to obtain an asymptotic formula for the sum of the Euler function with determinants of matrices from $\mathcal M_n\left(\mathbb Z; H\right)$.

Title:
Operators on injective tensor products of separable Banach spaces and spaces with few operators
Antonio Acuaviva
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We give a characterization of the operators on the injective tensor product $E \hat{\otimes}_\varepsilon X$ for any separable Banach space $E$ and any (non-separable) Banach space $X$ with few operators, in the sense that any operator $T: X \to X$ takes the form $T = \lambda I + S$ for a scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{K}$ and an operator $S$ with separable range. This is used to give a classification of the complemented subspaces and closed operator ideals of spaces of the form $C_0(\omega \times K_\mathcal{A})$, where $K_\mathcal{A}$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space induced by an almost disjoint family $\mathcal{A}$ such that $C_0(K_\mathcal{A})$ has few operators.

Locally minimax optimal confidence sets for the best model
Ilmun Kim, Aaditya Ramdas
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
This paper tackles a fundamental inference problem: given $n$ observations from a distribution $P$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ with unknown mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, we must form a confidence set for the index (or indices) corresponding to the smallest component of $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. By duality, we reduce this to testing, for each $r$ in $1,\ldots,d$, whether $\mu_r$ is the smallest. Based on the sample splitting and self-normalization approach of Kim and Ramdas (2024), we propose "dimension-agnostic" tests that maintain validity regardless of how $d$ scales with $n$, and regardless of arbitrary ties in $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. Notably, our validity holds under mild moment conditions, requiring little more than finiteness of a second moment, and permitting possibly strong dependence between coordinates. In addition, we establish the \emph{local} minimax separation rate for this problem, which adapts to the cardinality of a confusion set, and show that the proposed tests attain this rate. Furthermore, we develop robust variants that continue to achieve the same minimax rate under heavy-tailed distributions with only finite second moments. While these results highlight the theoretical strength of our method, a practical concern is that sample splitting can reduce finite-sample power. We show that this drawback can be substantially alleviated by the multi-split aggregation method of Guo and Shah (2025). Finally, empirical results on simulated and real data illustrate the strong performance of our approach in terms of type I error control and power compared to existing methods.

On the Picard number and the extension degree of period matrices of complex tori

Comments:
Final version to appear in the Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Complex Variables (math.CV)
The rank $\rho$ of the Néron-Severi group of a complex torus $X$ of dimension $g$ satisfies $0\leq\rho\leq g^2=h^{1,1}.$ The degree $\mathfrak{d}$ of the extension field generated over $\mathbb{Q}$ by the entries of a period matrix of $X$ imposes constraints on its Picard number $\rho$ and, consequently, on the structure of $X$. In this paper, we show that when $\mathfrak{d}$ is $2$, $3$, or $4$, the Picard number $\rho$ is necessarily large. Moreover, for an abelian variety $X$ of dimension $g$ with $\mathfrak{d}=3,$ we establish a structure-type result: $X$ must be isogenous to $E^g$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve without complex multiplication. In this case, the Picard number satisfies $\rho(X)=\frac{g(g+1)}{2}.$ As a byproduct, we obtain that if $\mathfrak{d}$ is odd, then $\rho(X)\leq\frac{g(g+1)}{2}.$

Relation morphisms of directed graphs

Associating graph algebras to directed graphs leads to both covariant and contravariant functors from suitable categories of graphs to the category k-Alg of algebras and algebra homomorphisms. As both functors are often used at the same time, finding a new category of graphs that allows a "common denominator" functor unifying the covariant and contravariant constructions is a fundamental problem. Herein, we solve this problem by first introducing the relation category of graphs RG, and then determining the concept of admissible graph relations that yields a subcategory of RG admitting a contravariant functor to k-Alg simultaneously generalizing the aforementioned covariant and contravariant functors. Although we focus on Leavitt path algebras and graph C*-algebras, on the way we unravel functors to k-Alg given by path algebras, Cohn path algebras and Toeplitz graph C*-algebras from suitable subcategories of RG. Better still, we illustrate relation morphisms of graphs by naturally occurring examples, including Cuntz algebras, quantum spheres and quantum balls.

The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective: Enumerations and Bounds

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Computational Geometry (cs.CG)
A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We construct upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence towards more general results.

We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.

Fractal geometry deals mainly with irregularity and captures the complexity of a structure or phenomenon. In this article, we focus on the approximation of set-valued functions using modern machinery on the subject of fractal geometry. We first provide a construction of fractal functions for countable data sets and use these functions in the approximation and study of set-valued mappings. We also show the existence and uniqueness of an invariant Borel measure supported on the graph of a set-valued fractal function. In addition, we obtain some effective bounds on the dimensions of the constructed set-valued fractal functions.

The existence and local uniqueness of the eigenfunctions of the non-linear operator $ Δ_H u^{n}$ in the hyperbolic Poincaré half-plane

In this article we find locally an eigenfunctions for a particular nonlinear hyperbolic differential operator $\Delta_H u^{n}$, where $\Delta_H$ is the hyperbolic Laplacian in the half-plane of Poincairé. We have proved that these eigenfunctions are an analytic and non-exact whose coefficients satisfy a specific algebraic recursive rule. The existence of these eigenfunctions allows us to find non-exact solutions respecting the spatial coordinate of nonlinear diffusive PDEs on the Poincairé half-plane, which could describe a possible one-dimensional physical model.

Let $K$ be the connected sum in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of an arbitrary knot and the $(2,q)$-torus knot for $q\neq \pm 1$, and consider its conormal bundle $L_K$ in $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove that there is no compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\varphi$ on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\varphi(L_K)$ and the zero section $\mathbb{R}^3$ intersect cleanly along the unknot in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For the proof, we examine the knot DGA, whose homology was proved to be isomorphic to the knot contact homology by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan, with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm},\mu^{\pm},U^{\pm}]$. We find an algebraic constraint imposed on every $\mathbb{Q}$-valued augmentation of the knot DGA of $K$ when $q\geq 3$. This constraint involves rational roots of polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[T]$, and we apply Hilbert's irreducibility theorem to complete the proof. Using a similar idea, we also prove an analogous result replacing the $(2,q)$-torus knot with the figure-eight knot.

In these examples, we compare global activity scores with Sobol' sensitivity indices, derivative-based sensitivity measures, and activity scores. The results show that in the presence of noise or high variability, global activity scores outperform derivative-based measures and activity scores, while in noiseless settings the three approaches yield similar results.

In particular, we generalize Atteson's work on the safety radius of phylogenetic reconstruction methods, as well as Gascuel and Steel's work on the stochastic safety radius, to arbitrary matroids. We also show that although the tropical Fermat-Weber points of an $M$-ultrametric sample are generally not contained in the space of $M$-ultrametrics, the intersection between the Fermat-Weber set and the space of $M$-ultrametrics is non-empty.

Musical Chords by the Numbers

Subjects:
History and Overview (math.HO)
The mathematics of musical intervals and scales has been extensively studied. Vastly simplified, our ears seem to prefer intervals whose frequency ratios have small numerator and denominator, such as 2:1 (octave), 3:2 (perfect fifth), 4:3 (perfect fourth), and so on. While there also have been numerous studies on the mathematics of musical chords, very few of them consider a model that measures consonance/dissonance of a given chord in analogy with this simple-fractions perspective. Our aim is to develop a measure for the consonance of a chord with crucial symmetry features, including invariance under chord translation, inversion, and interval sets. We apply our model to chords in various musical scales and compare it to existing models and empirical studies.

Time reversal of reflected Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting
Fausto Colantoni, Mirko D'Ovidio, Gianni Pagnini
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
In this paper, we study reflecting Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting. After providing a probabilistic description of the phenomenon using jump diffusions and semigroups, we analyze the time-reversed process starting from the stationary measure. We prove that the time-reversed process is a Brownian motion with a negative drift and non-local boundary conditions at zero. Moreover, we further study the time-reversed process between two consecutive resetting points and show that, within this time window, it behaves as the same reflecting Brownian motion with a negative drift, where both the jump sizes and the time spent at zero coincide with those of the process obtained under the stationary measure. We characterize the dynamics of both processes, their local times, and finally investigate elliptic problems on positive half-spaces, showing that the two processes leave the same traces at the boundary.

Higher Order Bell Symmetric Functions

Comments:
18 pages; corrected minor errors in sections 2.3 and 3.3; added citations
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We study symmetric function analogues of the higher order Bell numbers. Their construction involves iterated plethystic exponential towers mimicking the single variable exponential generating functions for the higher order Bell numbers. We derive explicit recurrence relations for the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions into the monomial and power sum bases of the ring of symmetric functions. Using the machinery of combinatorial species, the Bell functions are proven to be the Frobenius characteristics of the permutation representations of symmetric groups on hyper-partitions of certain orders and sizes. In the order 1 case, we are able to give more details about the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions in terms of vector partitions and divisor sums as well as give a recurrence relation analogous to the well known recursion for the Bell numbers. Lastly, we use Littlewood's reciprocity theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem to prove that the Schur expansion coefficients of the order 1 Bell functions are certain asymptotic averages of restriction coefficients.

Subjects:

We study online adversarial regression with convex losses against a rich class of continuous yet highly irregular prediction rules, modeled by Besov spaces $B\_{pq}^s$ with general parameters $1 \leq p,q \leq \infty$ and smoothness $s > \tfrac{d}{p}$. We introduce an adaptive wavelet-based algorithm that performs sequential prediction without prior knowledge of $(s,p,q)$, and establish minimax-optimal regret bounds against any comparator in $B\_{pq}^s$. We further design a locally adaptive extension capable of dynamically tracking spatially inhomogeneous smoothness. This adaptive mechanism adjusts the resolution of the predictions over both time and space, yielding refined regret bounds in terms of local regularity. Consequently, in heterogeneous environments, our adaptive guarantees can significantly surpass those obtained by standard global methods.

Kernel Ridge Regression with Predicted Feature Inputs and Applications to Factor-Based Nonparametric Regression
Xin Bing, Xin He, Chao Wang
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Kernel methods, particularly kernel ridge regression (KRR), are time-proven, powerful nonparametric regression techniques known for their rich capacity, analytical simplicity, and computational tractability. The analysis of their predictive performance has received continuous attention for more than two decades. However, in many modern regression problems where the feature inputs used in KRR cannot be directly observed and must instead be inferred from other measurements, the theoretical foundations of KRR remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for analyzing KRR with predicted feature inputs. Our framework is not only essential for handling predicted feature inputs -- enabling us to derive risk bounds without imposing any assumptions on the error of the predicted feature -- but also strengthens existing analyses in the classical setting by allowing arbitrary model misspecification, requiring weaker conditions under the squared loss, particularly allowing both an unbounded response and an unbounded function class, and being flexible enough to accommodate other convex loss functions. We apply our general theory to factor-based nonparametric regression models and establish the minimax optimality of KRR when the feature inputs are predicted using principal component analysis. Our theoretical findings are further corroborated by simulation studies and real-data analyses using pretrained LLM embeddings for the downstream prediction task.

In this paper, we gain the new almost unbiased Liu-type estimators to literature for the Bell regression model.

We also design an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study to show that the proposed estimators outperforms the competitors in terms of mean squared error theoretically. Finally, we present a real data study to assess the performance of the introduced estimators in modeling real-life data. The findings of both the simulation and the empirical study demonstrate that the proposed regression estimators surpasses its competitors based on the mean square error criterion.

Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System
Haiquan Lu, Yong Zeng, Shaodan Ma, Bin Li, Shi Jin, Rui Zhang
Comments:
15 pages, 10 figures
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication when the uniform plane wave (UPW) model holds, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying minimum safe distance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.

Here we first give an expository account of Mostowski's construction and surrounding results, and then we show that the construction bridges the domain of Tarski-style truth theories over PA with certain subsystems of second order arithmetic.

Revised version; Dedicated in memory of Bent Fuglede and will appear in Analysis Mathematica
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Bounded holomorphic interpolation problems associated to finitely many data have, in general, distinct solutions. Uniqueness arises only in some convex extreme configurations. Rational inner functions in a polydisk are the best understood examples in this sense. We analyze the continuity of global solutions as functions of the finite interpolation data in neighbourhoods of elements distinguished by this uniqueness property. Our study covers rational inner or Cayley rational inner functions in the polydisk and automorphisms of the Euclidean ball. The proof of the main superresolution result is derived from optimization theory techniques and volume estimates of sublevel sets of real polynomials, both emerging from Markov's multivariable moment problem.

Vietoris--Rips Shadow for Euclidean Graph Reconstruction
Rafal Komendarczyk, Sushovan Majhi, Atish Mitra
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Computational Geometry (cs.CG)
The shadow of an abstract simplicial complex $K$ with vertices in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ defined as the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space $(S,d)$ at scale $\beta$ is an abstract simplicial complex whose each $k$-simplex corresponds to $(k+1)$ points of $S$ within diameter $\beta$. In case $S\subset\mathbb R^2$ and $d(a,b)=\|a-b\|$ the standard Euclidean metric, the natural shadow projection of the Vietoris--Rips complex is already proved by Chambers et al. to induce isomorphisms on $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$. We extend the result beyond the standard Euclidean distance on $S\subset\mathbb R^N$ to a family of path-based metrics, $d^\varepsilon_{S}$. From the pairwise Euclidean distances of points in $S$, we introduce a family (parametrized by $\varepsilon$) of path-based Vietoris--Rips complexes $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ for a scale $\beta>0$. If $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is Hausdorff-close to a planar Euclidean graph $G$, we provide quantitative bounds on scales $\beta,\varepsilon$ for the shadow projection map of the Vietoris--Rips complex of $(S,d^\varepsilon_S)$ at scale $\beta$ to induce $\pi_1$-isomorphism. This paper first studies the homotopy-type recovery of $G\subset\mathbb R^N$ using the abstract Vietoris--Rips complex of a Hausdorff-close sample $S$ under the $d^\varepsilon_S$ metric. Then, our result on the $\pi_1$-isomorphism induced by the shadow projection lends itself to providing also a geometrically close embedding for the reconstruction. Based on the length of the shortest loop and large-scale distortion of the embedding of $G$, we quantify the choice of a suitable sample density $\varepsilon$ and a scale $\beta$ at which the shadow of $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ is homotopy-equivalent and Hausdorff-close to $G$.

Were Residual Penalty and Neural Operators All We Needed for Solving Optimal Control Problems?
Oliver G. S. Lundqvist, Fabricio Oliveira
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data, differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an iterative optimization routine. Our results show acceptable accuracy for practical applications and potential computational savings for more complex and higher-dimensional problems.

Optimization and Control (math.OC); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
There is extensive literature on accelerating first-order optimization methods in a Euclidean setting. Under which conditions such acceleration is feasible in Riemannian optimization problems is an active area of research. Motivated by the recent success of dynamic stepsize methods in the Euclidean setting, we undertake a study of such algorithms in the Riemannian setting. We provide the new class of algorithms determined by the choice of vector transport that allows the dynamic stepsize acceleration on Riemannian manifolds for the function classes associated with the corresponding vector transport. As a core application, we show our algorithm recovers the standard Wasserstein gradient descent on 2-Wasserstein space, and as a result provides the first provable accelerated gradient method in Wasserstein space. In addition, we validate the numerical strength of the algorithm for standard benchmark tasks on the space of symmetric positive definite matrices.

Let $\ell$ be prime, and $K$ be a number field containing the $\ell$-th roots of unity. We use classical algebraic number theory and some analytic techniques to prove that the Steinitz classes of $\mathbb Z/\ell\mathbb Z$ extensions of $K$ ordered by relative discriminant are equidistributed among realizable classes in the ideal class group of $K$. For $\ell = 2$, this was proved by Kable and Wright using the deep theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces. Foster proved that Steinitz classes are uniformly distributed between realizable classes for tamely ramified elementary-$m$ extensions using the theory of Galois modules; our approach eliminates this tameness hypothesis.

We propose a new nonconforming \(P_1\) finite element method for elliptic interface problems. The method is constructed on a locally anisotropic mixed mesh, which is generated by fitting the interface through a simple connection of intersection points on an interface-unfitted background mesh, as introduced in \cite{Hu2021optimal}. We first establish interpolation error estimates on quadrilateral elements satisfying the regular decomposition property (RDP). Building on this, the main contribution of this work is a novel consistency error analysis for nonconforming elements, which removes the quasi-regularity assumption commonly required in existing approaches. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.

Perturbation Effects on Word Lengths in Three-Reflection Symmetric Presentations of Dihedral Groups
Michael Allocca, Max Trimmer
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR)
We investigate the properties of word lengths of elements from a three-reflection symmetric generating set of the dihedral group $D_n$. Specifically, we provide the upper bound $\lambda_1(D_n,S) \leq \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor + 1$ for a quantity $\lambda_1$ defined in arXiv:1104.5044, which measures the stability of a finitely presented group under perturbations in the words corresponding to certain elements with respect to specific presentations. This quantity has been of recent interest due to its role in the application of group theory to computational genomics, and we aim to introduce techniques in additive combinatorics to its discourse.

Hutchcroft and Pete showed that countably infinite groups with Property (T) admit cost one actions, resolving a question of Gaboriau. We give a streamlined proof of their theorem, and extend it both to locally compact second countable groups and unimodular random graphs. We prove unimodular random graph analogues of the Connes--Weiss and Glasner--Weiss theorem characterising Property (T).

Quasi-triangular and factorizable Poisson bialgebras
Yuanchang Lin, Dilei Lu
Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
In this paper, we introduce the notions of quasi-triangular and factorizable Poisson bialgebras. A factorizable Poisson bialgebra induces a factorization of the underlying Poisson algebra. We prove that the Drinfeld classical double of a Poisson bialgebra naturally admits a factorizable Poisson bialgebra structure. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebras and show that a quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebra of zero weight induces a triangular Poisson bialgebra. Moreover, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable Poisson bialgebras and quadratic Rota-Baxter Poisson algebras of nonzero weights. Finally, we establish the quasi-triangular and factorizable theories for differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras, and construct quasi-triangular and factorizable Poisson bialgebras from quasi-triangular and factorizable (commutative and cocommutative) differential ASI bialgebras respectively.

On Weary Drivers, Records of Trees, and Parking Functions

This work builds on a decomposition of a Cayley tree using the notion of a record, a concept closely related to the blob encoding of a tree introduced by Kreweras and Moszkowski, and Picciotto, that we explore and extend. We provide an alternative definition of parking functions and derive from it a record-preserving bijection between Cayley trees and parking functions. Finally, we use this bijection to establish an equidistribution between a sextuple of statistics on Cayley trees and a corresponding sextuple of statistics on parking functions.

Elias' Encoding from Lagrangians and Renormalization

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In the present paper we give a principled derivation of Elias' Omega code by combining a constrained variational formulation of prefix coding with a renormalization flow on codeword distributions. Starting from a Lagrangian that minimizes average code length under the Kraft-McMillan constraint, we show that the implied distribution is a fixed point of a coarse-graining map, yielding the canonical iterated logarithm length, up to an additive constant.
This establishes completeness and asymptotic optimality, and connects universal integer coding with coarse-grained entropy, uncertainty-type bounds, and multiplicity relations familiar from statistical physics. The renormalization operator induces a discrete flow that converges to the Elias fixed point for any admissible initialization, up to a bounded error, offering a clean bridge between information-theoretic constraints and RG-style scale invariance.

Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes
Rahim Rahmati-asghar
Comments:
Comments are welcome
Subjects:

We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.

Random Flights and Anomalous Diffusion: A Non-Markovian Take on Lorentz Processes
Lorenzo Facciaroni, Costantino Ricciuti, Enrico Scalas, Bruno Toaldo
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We study Lorentz processes in two different settings. Both cases are characterized by infinite expectation of the free-flight times, contrary to what happens in the classical Gallavotti-Spohn models. Under a suitable Boltzmann-Grad type scaling limit, they converge to non-Markovian random-flight processes with superdiffusive behavior. A further scaling limit yields another non Markovian process, i.e., a superdiffusion obtained by a suitable time-change of Brownian motion. Furthermore, we obtain the governing equations for our random flights and anomalous diffusion, which represent a non-local counterpart for the linear-Boltzmann and diffusion equations arising in the classical theory. It turns out that these equations have the form of fractional kinetic equations in both time and space. To prove these results, we develop a technique based on mixtures of Feller semigroups.

Plücker coordinates define the $T^n$-equivariant embedding $p : G_{n,2}\to \C P^{N}$ of a complex Grassmann manifold $G_{n,2}$ into the complex projective space $\C P^{N}$, $N=\binom{n}{2}-1$ for the canonical $T^n$-action on $G_{n,2}$ and the $T^n$-action on $\C P^{N}$ given by the second exterior power representation $T^n\to T^{N}$ and the standard $T^{N}$-action. Let $\mu : G_{n,2}\to \Delta_{n,2}\subset \R ^{n}$ and $\tilde{\mu}: \C P^{N}\to \Delta _{n,2}\subset \R^n$ be the moment maps for the $T^n$-actions on $G_{n,2}$ and $\C P^{N}$ respectively, such that $\tilde{\mu} \circ p=\mu$. The preimages $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})$ and $\tilde{\mu} ^{-1}({\bf y})$ are smooth submanifolds in $G_{n, 2}$ and $\C P^{N}$, for any regular values ${\bf x}, {\bf y} \in \Delta _{n,2}$ for these maps, respectively. The orbit spaces $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})/T^n$ and $\tilde{\mu}^{-1}({\bf y})/T^n$ are symplectic manifolds, which are known as symplectic reduction.
The regular values for $\mu$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ coincide for $n=4$ and we prove that $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})$ and $\tilde{\mu}^{-1}({\bf x}) $ do not depend on a regular value ${\bf x}\in \Delta_{4,2}$. We provide their explicit topological description, that is we prove $\mu^{-1}({\bf x})\cong S^3\times T^2$ and $\tilde{\mu} ^{-1}({\bf x})\cong S^5\times T^2$.
The Deligne - Mumford compactification $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$ is proved to be a symplectic reduction of $G_{n,2}$ by the canonical $T^n$-action if and only if $n=4,5$, while the Losev - Manin compactification is a such symplectic reduction if and only if $n=5$.

Moduli space of spin connections on three-dimensional homogeneous spaces

Subjects:

In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous SU(2) connections on three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy groups.
Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in the cosmological setting.

A Homothetic Gauge Theory
Fereidoun Sabetghadam
Comments:
24 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We introduce a Homothetic Hodge-de Rham (HHDR) theory that extends the de Rham complex to homothetically transformed differential forms and develops the associated homothetic Hodge machinery. Enforcing homothetic symmetry on physical laws naturally yields scale-covariant couplings, interpretable as canonical penalty terms in the framework of differential equations. Building on this foundation, we construct a Homothetic Gauge Theory (HGT) and apply it to classical electromagnetism, leading to generalized homothetic Maxwell equations. The approach establishes a link between homothetic scaling and conformal field theory concepts such as the dilaton field and vacuum expectation values (VEVs). As a concrete physical application, we address the classical divergence of point charge self-energy. By modeling the source as a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition, we obtain a non-singular electrostatic potential. This framework highlights a mathematically rigorous and physically meaningful extension of gauge theory with potential relevance across field theory and electrodynamics.

Classification of global attractors for $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant parabolic equations: a survey
Carlos Rocha, Bernold Fiedler, Alejandro López-Nieto
Comments:
37+ii pages, 9 figures, 1 table
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We survey the global dynamics of semiflows generated by scalar semilinear parabolic equations which are $\mathbb{SO}(2)$ equivariant under spatial shifts of $x\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $$ u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x),\qquad x\in \mathbb{S}^1.$$ For dissipative $C^2$ nonlinearities $f$, the semiflow possesses a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ which we call Sturm attractor. The Sturm attractor $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ decomposes as $$ \mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}\cup\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P},$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$ denotes heteroclinic orbits between distinct elements of spatially homogeneous equilibria $\mathcal{E}$, rigidly rotating waves $\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and, as their non-rotating counterparts, frozen waves $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}$. We therefore represent $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ by its connection graph $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$, with vertices in $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P},\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and edges $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$. Under mild hyperbolicity assumptions, the directed graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ are finite and transitive. For illustration, we enumerate all 21 connection graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ with up to seven vertices. The result uses a lap signature of period maps associated to integrable versions of the steady state ODE of our PDE.
As an example, we freeze and reconstruct the connection graph of the Vas tulip attractor, known from delay differential equations, in our PDE setting.

Splitting a graph by a given partition of the set of vertices based on the minimum weight of the induced trees

A method for considering a weighted directed graph with an accuracy of up to a given partition of the set of vertices is proposed. The resulting digraph (the splitting graph) does not contain arcs inside each partition element, and the arcs between the partition atoms are calculated in a special way taking into account the arcs of the original directed graph inside the atoms. This accounting is based on minimal trees defined on atoms. A study was made of what information about the original digraph is preserved in its splitting.

2-switch-degree classification of split graphs

The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of indecomposable graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying indecomposable split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify indecomposable split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.

We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

Bounds and Constructions of High-Memory Spatially-Coupled Codes
Lei Huang
Subjects:

In this paper, we apply the Clique Lovász Local Lemma to provide sufficient conditions on memory and lifting degree for removing certain harmful combinatorial structures in spatially-coupled (SC) codes that negatively impact decoding performance. Additionally, we present, for the first time, a constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.

Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods with Multiquadric and Inverse Multiquadric Radial Basis Functions
Shipra Mahata, Samala Rathan
Comments:

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this article, a family of two- and three-stage explicit multiquadric (MQ) and inverse multiquadric (IMQ) radial basis functions (RBFs) Runge-Kutta methods are introduced for solving ordinary differential equations. These methods are developed by utilizing MQ- and IMQ-RBF Euler methods. The main advantage of these RBF-based methods lies in their ability to achieve a one-order higher accuracy than their classical Runge-Kutta counterparts without increasing the number of stages. This improvement is made possible by incorporating RBF corrections, where the optimal shape parameter is determined through the local truncation error analysis of the proposed schemes. Convergence and stability analyses, including the study of stability regions, are presented to illustrate how these methods compare with standard Runge-Kutta schemes. Numerical experiments on five benchmark problems further confirm predicted accuracy and stability, demonstrating that MQ- and IMQ-based RBF Runge-Kutta methods provide an alternative to conventional low-stage explicit RungeKutta schemes.

Fair coalition in graphs

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. A dominating set of $G$ is a subset $D\subseteq V$ such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. The cardinality of a smallest dominating set of $G$, denoted by $\gamma(G)$, is the domination number of $G$. For $k \geq 1$, a $k$-fair dominating set ($kFD$-set) in $G$, is a dominating set $S$ such that $|N(v) \cap D|=k$ for every vertex $ v \in V\setminus D$. A fair dominating set in $G$ is a $kFD$-set for some integer $k\geq 1$. We consider $1FD$-sets and define a fair coalition in a graph $G$ as a pair of disjoint subsets $A_1, A_2 \subseteq A$ that satisfy the following conditions: (a) neither $A_1$ nor $A_2$ constitutes a $1$-fair dominating set of $G$, and (b) $A_1\cup A_2$ constitutes a $1$-fair dominating set of $G$. A fair coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\Upsilon = \{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_k\}$ of its vertex set such that every set $A_i$ of $\Upsilon$ is either a singleton $1$-fair dominating set of $G$, or is not a $1$-fair dominating set of $G$ but forms a fair coalition with another non-$1$-fair dominating set $A_j\in \Upsilon$. We define the fair coalition number of $G$ as the maximum cardinality of a fair coalition partition of $G$, and we denote it by $\mathcal{C}_f(G)$. We initiate the study of the fair coalition in graphs and obtain $\mathcal{C}_f(G)$ for some specific graphs.

Optimization and Control (math.OC); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
When given a generalized matrix separation problem, which aims to recover a low rank matrix $L_0$ and a sparse matrix $S_0$ from $M_0=L_0+HS_0$, the work \cite{CW25} proposes a novel convex optimization problem whose objective function is the sum of the $\ell_1$-norm and nuclear norm. In this paper we detail the iterative algorithms and its associated computations for solving this convex optimization problem. We present various efficient implementation strategies, with attention to practical cases where $H$ is circulant, separable, or block structured. Notably, we propose a preconditioning technique that drastically improved the performance of our algorithms in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. While this paper serves as an illustrative algorithm implementation manual, we also provide theoretical guarantee for our preconditioning strategy. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A nonzero solution is obtained via Morse theory when the nonlinearity is asymptotically scaled at infinity. For this purpose we prove an abstract result on the critical groups at infinity for functionals satisfying the geometric assumptions of the scaled saddle point theorem of Mercuri \& Perera [arXiv:2411.15887]. For the case that $f (| x |, \cdot)$ is odd, a sequence of solutions are obtained via a version of Clark's theorem due to Kajikiya [J.\ Funct.\ Anal.\ 225 (2005) 352--370].

Concentration comparison for nonlinear diffusion on model manifolds and Pólya-Szegő inequality
Matteo Muratori, Bruno Volzone
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
We investigate the validity of the mass concentration comparison for a class of nonlinear diffusion equations posed on Riemannian manifolds $ \mathbb{M}^n $ that are spherically symmetric, that is, model manifolds. The concentration comparison states that the solution of a certain diffusion equation that takes the radially decreasing (Schwarz) rearrangement $ u_0^\star $ as its initial datum is more concentrated than the original solution starting from $u_0$. This is known to hold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a consequence of the celebrated Pólya-Szegő inequality, which asserts that the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of a function $f$ (belonging to an appropriate Sobolev space) is always larger than the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of its radially decreasing rearrangement $f^\star$. However, if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ is a general model manifold, it is not for granted that the Pólya-Szegő inequality holds; in fact, we will provide a simple condition involving the scalar curvature of $\mathbb{M}^n $ under which such an inequality actually fails. The main result we prove states that, given any continuous, nondecreasing, and nontrivial function $ \phi: [0,+\infty) \to [0,+\infty) $, the filtration equation $ \partial_t u = \Delta \phi(u) $ satisfies the concentration comparison in $ \mathbb{M}^n \times (0,+\infty) $ if and only if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports the Pólya-Szegő inequality. In particular, the validity of such a comparison for the heat equation is sufficient to guarantee that the same holds for all filtration equations. Moreover, we prove that if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports a centered isoperimetric inequality then the Pólya-Szegő inequality, and thus the concentration comparison, holds. This allows us to include important examples such as the hyperbolic space and the sphere.

We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra.
We show that if two such RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, their multiplier algebras are likewise almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. In such cases, the underlying varieties are almost automorphically equivalent. For tractable homogeneous varieties, we further show that if the corresponding multiplier algebras are almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras or one variety is almost the image of the other under a unitary transformation, then the associated RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs.

For any three nonzero vectors $a,b,c$ in $\mathbb R^2$, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the sum of the three pairwise angles between these vectors to equal $2\pi$. As an easy consequence of this, a proof of Euclid's theorem that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is $\pi$ is provided. So, the main result of this note can be considered a generalization of Euclid's theorem. To a large extent, the consideration is reduced almost immediately to a choice for the sum of three related angles among the three integer multiples $0,2\pi,4\pi$ of $\pi$. The rest of the consideration concerns only various betweenness relations.

We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates. A detailed comparison of the Itô and Stratonovich interpretations for the proposed model is presented in the Appendix.

Improved existence time for the Whitham equation and a Whitham-Boussinesq system

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we investigate the time of existence of the solutions to two full dispersion models derived from the water waves equations in the shallow water regime: the Whitham equation and a Whitham-Boussinesq system in dimension one and two. The regime is characterized by the nonlinearity parameter $\epsilon\in(0,1]$ and the shallow water parameter $\mu\in(0,1]$.
We extend the lifespan of the solution beyond the hyperbolic time $\epsilon^{-1}$. More precisely, we establish well-posedness on the timescale of order $\mu^{\frac{1}{4}^-}\epsilon^{(-\frac{5}{4})^+}$ in the one-dimensional case, and of order $\mu^{\frac{1}{4}^-}\epsilon^{(-\frac{3}{2})^+}$ in dimension two. We emphasize that for the two-dimensional case, we obtain a time of existence of order $\epsilon^{-\frac54}$ in the long wave regime $\mu \sim \epsilon$. This kind of result seems to be new, even for the Boussinesq systems.
The proofs combine energy methods with Strichartz estimates. Here, a key ingredient is to obtain new refined Strichartz estimates that include the small parameter $\mu$. These techniques are robust and could be adapted to improve the lifespan of solutions for other equations and systems of the same form.

The density conjecture for activated random walk on the interval was recently resolved using a new tool called layer percolation. As a step towards understanding how layer percolation extends to activated random walk on more complex graphs, we develop its analog for the comb graph and use it to prove bounds on the critical density. Additionally, we provide simulation evidence suggesting that the comb has different critical densities on its spine and teeth, both of which are smaller than the critical density for the interval.

Invariant Random Subgroups, Soficity, and Lück's determinant conjecture

Subjects:

We extend Lück's determinant conjecture from groups to invariant random subgroups (IRS) of free groups, a framework generalizing groups where a non-sofic object is known to exist. For every free group, we prove the existence of an IRS satisfying the determinant conjecture that is not co-hyperlinear, and hence not co-sofic. This provides evidence that satisfying the determinant conjecture might be a weaker property than soficity for groups, and consequently the conjecture possibly holds for all groups. We use techniques from non-local games and $\mathsf{MIP}^* = \mathsf{RE}$, showing more generally when the latter can be used to narrow down when a von Neumann algebra (or IRS) contains a non-Connes embeddable object.

Transcendency of variants of Mills' constant
Kota Saito
Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
Let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denote the integer part of $x$. For every sequence $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ of positive integers, we define $\xi(C_k)$ as the smallest real number $\xi>1$ such that $\lfloor \xi^{C_k} \rfloor$ is a prime number for every positive integer $k$. The number $\xi(3^k)$ is called Mills' constant. Recently, the author showed that $\xi(3^k)$ is irrational, but the transcendency of this number is still open. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on $(C_k)_{k\ge 1}$ to determine the transcendency of $\xi(C_k)$. For example, we obtain the following three results:
(A) $\xi(\lfloor b^k\rfloor)$ is irrational for every real number $b\geq 1+\sqrt{2}$;
(B) $\xi((1+\sqrt{2})^k+(1-\sqrt{2})^k)$ is transcendental;
(C) $\xi(r3^k-1)$ is transcendental for every integer $r\geq 4.003\times 10^{14}$.
Furthermore, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, $\xi(3^k-1)$ is transcendental. However, we still do not know whether Mills' constant is transcendental.

Exact Solution for Two $δ$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $δ$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.

In their seminal work (Amer. J.

However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.

We investigate harmonic analysis of random matrices of large size with their Dyson indices going simultaneous to zero, that is in the high temperature limit. In this regime, we show that the multivariate Bessel function/Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function of the empirical spectral distribution converges to the Fourier/Mellin transform of a measure, which and the limiting empirical distribution are intimately related by the Markov-Krein correspondence. The uniqueness, existence and other properties of the Markov-Krein correspondence can be studied using the theory of the Dirichlet process.

We present a new proof of a theorem of Chen and Jiang: for any integer $n>1$, there is a constant $K_n>0$ such that every smooth projective $n$-fold $X$ with $\operatorname{vol}(X)>K_n$ has either the stable birational $2$-canonical map or a M$^c$Kernan fibration. This amends a gap in the original proof. As a direct application of our method, we improve a former boundedness theorem of Lacini and prove that for any integer $r>1$ and $n\geq 1$, $r$-canonical maps of $n$-folds of general type have birationally bounded fibers. This gives an affirmative answer to a question posed by Chen and Jiang in 2014.

$K$-Theory of Adelic and Rational Group $C^*$-algebras via Generalized Winding Numbers
Wenqing Wu, Hang Wang
Subjects:

We take the following approach to analyze homotopy equivalence in periodic adelic functions. First, we introduce the concept of pre-periodic functions and define their homotopy invariant through the construction of a generalized winding number. Subsequently, we establish a fundamental correspondence between periodic adelic functions and pre-periodic functions. By extending the generalized winding number to periodic adelic functions, we demonstrate that this invariant completely characterizes homotopy equivalence classes within the space of periodic adelic functions. Building on this classification, we obtain an explicit description of the $K_{1}$-group of the rational group $C^\ast$-algebra, $K_{1}(C^{*}(\mathbb{Q}))$. Finally, we employ a similar strategy to determine the structure of $K_1(C^{\ast}(\mathbb{A}))$.

We establish new convergence rates for PAGE, showing that its complexity improves as $\tau$ decreases.

Stabilization by Harvesting in Age-Structured Trophic Networks

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We propose and analyze a nonlinear age-structured multi-species model that serves as a unifying framework for ecological and biotechnological systems in complex environments (microbial communities, bioreactors, and others). The formulation incorporates nonlocal intra- and interspecific interactions modulated by environmental covariates. Under general assumptions on mortality, reproduction rates, and interaction kernels, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions. We illustrate the model's practical relevance along two lines. First, multi-species examples, notably a non-transitive (cyclic) competition model, for which we show that, under the model assumptions, a control applied to a single species can achieve global stabilization of the system. Second, the population dynamics of malaria-vector mosquitoes, for which we develop two control strategies (biological and genetic). In the biological-control scenario, we prove global asymptotic stability of the aquatic compartment by constructing an explicit Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and compare the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in reducing vector density and malaria transmission.

For each case in which the total space is orientable, we construct, by explicit clutching, a realization as a $T^2$-equivariant linear $S^4$-bundle over $S^4$. We determine which of the total spaces of these examples are non-equivariantly homotopy equivalent, homeomorphic or diffeomorphic, thereby finding many examples of a) pairs of homotopy equivalent, non-homeomorphic GKM manifolds with different first Pontryagin class, and b) pairs of GKM actions on the same smooth manifold whose GKM graphs do not agree as unlabeled graphs.

By using the vector-valued theory of singular integrals, we prove a Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality on product Hardy spaces $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$, which is a parallel result of the classical Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality. The same technique shows the $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$-boundedness of the iterated Hilbert transform. As a byproduct, new proofs of several recently discovered Hardy type inequalities on product Hardy spaces are obtained, which avoid complicated Calderón--Zygmund theory on product domain, rendering them considerably simpler than the original proofs.

We provide a Caporaso-Harris type recursive formula for the refined counts of higher genus floor diagrams. As an application of the correspondence theorem, we propose a higher genus version of the BPS polynomials of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\geq3$ and Hirzebruch surfaces, which generalize the higher genus Block-Göttsche polynomials.

Statistical Inference for Misspecified Contextual Bandits
Yongyi Guo, Ziping Xu
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)
Contextual bandit algorithms have transformed modern experimentation by enabling real-time adaptation for personalized treatment and efficient use of data. Yet these advantages create challenges for statistical inference due to adaptivity. A fundamental property that supports valid inference is policy convergence, meaning that action-selection probabilities converge in probability given the context. Convergence ensures replicability of adaptive experiments and stability of online algorithms. In this paper, we highlight a previously overlooked issue: widely used algorithms such as LinUCB may fail to converge when the reward model is misspecified, and such non-convergence creates fundamental obstacles for statistical inference. This issue is practically important, as misspecified models -- such as linear approximations of complex dynamic system -- are often employed in real-world adaptive experiments to balance bias and variance.
Motivated by this insight, we propose and analyze a broad class of algorithms that are guaranteed to converge even under model misspecification. Building on this guarantee, we develop a general inference framework based on an inverse-probability-weighted Z-estimator (IPW-Z) and establish its asymptotic normality with a consistent variance estimator. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed method provides robust and data-efficient confidence intervals, and can outperform existing approaches that exist only in the special case of offline policy evaluation. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of designing adaptive algorithms with built-in convergence guarantees to enable stable experimentation and valid statistical inference in practice.

Then we show that all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathcal{HI}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$ are defined over certain cyclotomic fields. As a direct result, we obtain the formal codegrees of $\mathcal{HI}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$, which satisfy the pseudo-unitary inequality.

We further relate the optimal constant in this interpolation inequality to a corresponding variational problem. These results extend classical Sobolev logarithmic inequalities to the nonlocal Euclidean framework and provide new tools for analysis in fractional Sobolev spaces.

The Landscape of Fairness: An Axiomatic and Predictive Framework for Network QoE Sensitivity
Zhiyuan Ren, Xinke Jian, Wenchi Cheng, Kun Yang
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
Evaluating network-wide fairness is challenging because it is not a static property but one highly sensitive to Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters. This paper introduces a complete analytical framework to transform fairness evaluation from a single-point measurement into a proactive engineering discipline centered on a predictable sensitivity landscape. Our framework is built upon a QoE-Imbalance metric whose form is not an ad-hoc choice, but is uniquely determined by a set of fundamental axioms of fairness, ensuring its theoretical soundness. To navigate the fairness landscape across the full spectrum of service demands, we first derive a closed-form covariance rule. This rule provides an interpretable, local compass, expressing the fairness gradient as the covariance between a path's information-theoretic importance and its parameter sensitivity. We then construct phase diagrams to map the global landscape, revealing critical topological features such as robust "stable belts" and high-risk "dangerous wedges". Finally, an analysis of the landscape's curvature yields actionable, topology-aware design rules, including an optimal "Threshold-First" tuning strategy. Ultimately, our framework provides the tools to map, interpret, and navigate the landscape of system sensitivity, enabling the design of more robust and resilient networks.

We show that any action of a finite group on a finitely presentable group arises as the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on its fundamental group. In doing so, we prove that any finite connected (abstract) simplicial complex $\mathbf{K}$ can be rigidified -- meaning it can be perturbed in a way that reduces the full automorphism group to any subgroup -- while preserving the homotopy type of the geometric realization $| \mathbf{K} |$. We also obtain that every action of a finite group on a finitely generated abelian group is the action of the group of self-homotopy equivalences of a space on one of its higher homotopy groups.

We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.

We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the Čech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively Høegh-Krohn-Skjelbred.

Jacobi permutations, introduced by Viennot in the context of Jacobi elliptic functions, are counted by the Euler numbers $E_{n}$ appearing in the series expansion $\sec x+\tan x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}E_{n}x^{n}/n!$. We conduct a systematic study of pattern avoidance in Jacobi permutations, achieving a complete enumeration of Jacobi permutations avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. In the case of a single pattern restriction, we obtain refined enumerations with respect to several permutation statistics: the number of ascents (or descents), the number of left-to-right minima, and the last letter. Bijections involving certain subfamilies of binary trees and Dyck paths, as well as generating function techniques, play important roles in our proofs.

In 1959, Erdős and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established.
In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erdős--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959. In particular, our result confirms a remark of Billsborough et al., who observed that if the original Erdős--Szekeres proof could be fixed, the O'Hara--Rodriguez bound would yield exactly this inequality.

Title:
The Aubin Property for Generalized Equations over $C^2$-cone Reducible Sets

v2: Minor corrections and typo fixes
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper establishes the equivalence of the Aubin property and the strong regularity for generalized equations over $C^2$-cone reducible sets. This result resolves a long-standing question in variational analysis and extends the well-known equivalence theorem for polyhedral sets to a significantly broader class of non-polyhedral cases. Our proof strategy departs from traditional variational techniques, integrating insights from convex geometry with powerful tools from algebraic topology. A cornerstone of our analysis is a new fundamental lemma concerning the local structure of the normal cone map for arbitrary closed convex sets, which reveals how the dimension of normal cones varies in the neighborhood of a boundary point. This geometric insight is the key to applying degree theory, allowing us to prove that a crucial function associated with the problem has a topological index of $\pm1$. This, via a homological version of the inverse mapping theorem, implies that the function is a local homeomorphism, which in turn yields the strong regularity of the original solution map. This result unifies and extends several existing stability results for problems such as conventional nonlinear programming, nonlinear second-order cone programming, and nonlinear semidefinite programming under a single general framework.

The Serre depth of Stanley-Reisner rings and the depth of their symbolic powers
Yuji Muta, Naoki Terai
Comments:

Subjects:
Commutative Algebra (math.AC); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We investigate an invariant, called the Serre depth, from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. In this paper, we establish several properties of an analogue of the depth of Stanley-Reisner rings. In particular, we relate the Serre depth both to the minimal free resolution of a Stanley-Reisner ring and to that of its Alexander dual. Also, we establish an analogue of a known result that describes the depth of Stanley-Reisner rings in terms of skeletons. Moreover, we study the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth on the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals. It had been an open question whether the depth of the symbolic powers of Stanley-Reisner ideals satisfies a non-increasing property, but Nguyen and Trung provided a negative answer. We construct an example that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth do not satisfy this property and its second symbolic power is Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we prove that the sequence of the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the symbolic powers is convergent and that its limit coincides with the minimum value. Finally, we study the Serre depth on edge and cover ideals. Whether the depth on symbolic powers of edge ideals satisfies a non-increasing property has remained an open question. We address a related problem and show that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on edge ideals of any well-covered graph satisfies a non-increasing property. In addition, we prove that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the cover ideals of any graph also satisfies a non-increasing property. Moreover, we determine the Serre depth on edge ideals of very well-covered graphs.

Boundedness of solutions of the first-order linear multidimensional difference equations

Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We investigate the boundedness of solutions of the first order linear difference equation of the form $x_{n+1} = Ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $A$ is a square matrix with complex entries, sequence $\{y_{n}\}_{n\geq 1}$ and initial value $x_1$ are supposed to be known. Firstly, we discuss the one-dimensional case of this equation $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $a$ is a complex number. In particular, we obtain the sufficient conditions for boundedness or unboundedness of the solutions in case $|a|=1$(the critical case) by considering the exponential sums of the forms $\sum y_{n}e(n\varphi)$ and $\sum e(f(n))$.
Then we proceed to the investigation of the equation in the multidimensional case and reduce our problem to analysis of the spectrum and Jordan cells of matrix $A$. The problem is especially interesting when spectrum of $A$ contains eigenvalues $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|=1$. At the end of the article we obtain a theorem that reveals the connection between equations $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $|a|=1$ and $x_{n+1} = Jx_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $J$ being a Jordan cell of an eigenvalue $\lambda$, $|\lambda|=1$.

Title:
A class of flexible and efficient partitioned Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev methods for some time-dependent partial differential equations
Xiao Tang, Junwei Huang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Many time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) can be transformed into an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) containing moderately stiff and non-stiff terms after spatial semi-discretization. In the present paper, we construct a new class of second-order partitioned explicit stabilized methods for the above ODEs. We treat the moderately stiff term with an s-stage Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) method and treat the non-stiff term with a 4m-stage explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) method. Different from several existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods that employ fixed-stage RK methods to handle the non-stiff term, both the parameters $s$ and $m$ in our methods can be flexibly adjusted as needed for the problems. This feature endows our methods with superior flexibility and applicability compared to several existing partitioned explicit stabilized methods, as demonstrated in several specific numerical examples (including the advection-diffusion equations, the Burgers equations, the Brusselator equations and the damped wave equations).

Computing the Zeros of a Holomorphic Function Using Quadrature-Based Subdivision and Rational Approximation of the Logarithmic Derivative
Jake Bowhay, Yuji Nakatsukasa, Irwin Zaid
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce a new method that uses AAA approximation to reliably compute all the zeros of a holomorphic function in a specified search region in the complex plane. Specifically, the method is based on rational approximation of the logarithmic derivative in combination with subdivision of the search region based on Cauchy's argument principle. This is motivated by the fact that, while it is straightforward to compute the zeros of a AAA rational approximation, there is no guarantee that all of the zeros of the function being approximated will be found. Many of the ideas presented are also applicable to computing both the zeros and the poles of a meromorphic function. A implementation of the method is provided by the Python package skzeros.

Equitably Coloring Planar and Outerplanar Graphs
Daniel W. Cranston, Reem Mahmoud
Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A proper $s$-coloring of an $n$-vertex graph is \emph{equitable} if every color class has size $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ or $\lceil{n/s}\rceil$. A necessary condition to have an equitable $s$-coloring is that every vertex $v$ appears in an independent set of size at least $\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. That is $\min_{v\in V(G)}\alpha_v\ge \lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$. Various authors showed that when $G$ is a tree and $s\ge 3$ this obvious necessary condition is also sufficient. Kierstead, Kostochka, and Xiang asked whether this result holds more generally for all outerplanar graphs. We show that the answer is No when $s=3$, but that the answer is Yes when $s\ge 6$. The case $s\in\{4,5\}$ remains open. We also prove an analogous result for planar graphs, with a necessary and sufficient hypothesis. Fix $s\ge 40$. Let $G$ be a planar graph, and let $w_0,w_1$ be its $2$ vertices with largest degrees. If there exist disjoint independent sets $I_0, I_1$ such that $|I_0|=\lfloor{n/s}\rfloor$ and $|I_1| = \lfloor{(n+1)/s}\rfloor$ and $w_0,w_1\in I_0\cup I_1$, then $G$ has an equitable $s$-coloring.

A ring polymer is a random walk whose steps obey a single linear condition; their sum vanishes. Factoring the graph Laplacian into the product of the incidence matrix and its transpose allows us to show that for a more complicated network, the steps must lie in a linear subspace determined by the graph topology. This provides a useful new perspective on the James--Guth theory of phantom elastic networks. In particular, we formulate phantom networks which are free from the constraints of fixed crosslinks. For a given network the solution of the loop constraints makes the partition function finite-valued in the path integral formulation without applying any external forces or fixing any monomer positions. The resulting probability distribution on edge displacements is rotationally invariant, which is practically quite useful for generating unbiased random samples of edge displacements and monomer positions. Furthermore, one can exactly calculate many physical quantities such as correlation functions with respect to this distribution. Finally, this reformulation lends itself well to the case of non-Gaussian distributions. We illustrate this by computing the expected radius of gyration of a ring polymer in a wide variety of models.

We define a generalized form of $L_\infty$-algebras called $E_2L_\infty$-algebras. As we show, these provide the natural algebraic framework for generalized geometry and the symmetries of double field theory as well as the gauge algebras arising in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. Our perspective shows that the kinematical data of the tensor hierarchy is an adjusted higher gauge theory, which is important for developing finite gauge transformations as well as non-local descriptions. Mathematically, $E_2L_\infty$-algebras shed some light on Loday's problem of integrating Leibniz algebras.

Minimizing an Uncrossed Collection of Drawings

Subjects:

In this paper, we introduce the following new concept in graph drawing. Our task is to find a small collection of drawings such that they all together satisfy some property that is useful for graph visualization. We propose investigating a property where each edge is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. We call such collection uncrossed. This property is motivated by a quintessential problem of the crossing number, where one asks for a drawing where the number of edge crossings is minimum. Indeed, if we are allowed to visualize only one drawing, then the one which minimizes the number of crossings is probably the neatest for the first orientation. However, a collection of drawings where each highlights a different aspect of a graph without any crossings could shed even more light on the graph's structure.
We propose two definitions. First, the uncrossed number, minimizes the number of graph drawings in a collection, satisfying the uncrossed property. Second, the uncrossed crossing number, minimizes the total number of crossings in the collection that satisfy the uncrossed property. For both definitions, we establish initial results. We prove that the uncrossed crossing number is NP-hard, but there is an FPT algorithm parameterized by the solution size.

Recently, [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1] considered spin glass models with additional conventional order parameters characterizing single-replica properties. These parameters are distinct from the standard order parameter, the overlap, used to measure correlations between replicas. A ``min-max'' formula for the free energy was prescribed in [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1007/s10955-023-03135-1]. We rigorously verify this prescription in the setting of vector spin glass models featuring additional deterministic spin interactions. Notably, our results can be viewed as a generalization of the Parisi formula for vector spin glass models in [DOI:https://doi.org/10.1214/17-AOP1194], where the order parameter for self-overlap is already present.

In [Incer Romeo, I. X., \textit{The Algebra of Contracts}. Ph.D. Thesis, UC Berkeley (2022)] an algebraic perspective on assume-guarantee contracts is proposed. This proposal relies on a construction involving Boolean algebras. However, the structures thus proposed lack a clearly prescribed set of basic operations, necessary if we want to see them as a class of algebras (in the sense of Universal Algebra). In this article, by prescribing a suitable set of basic operations on contracts, we manage to describe these algebras as (a generating set of members of) well-known varieties.

Implicational bases (IBs) are a common representation of finite closure systems and lattices, along with meet-irreducible elements. They appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from logic and databases to Knowledge Space Theory. Different IBs can represent the same closure system. Therefore, several IBs have been studied, such as the canonical and canonical direct bases. In this paper, we investigate the $D$-base, a refinement of the canonical direct base. It is connected with the $D$-relation, an essential tool in the study of free lattices. The $D$-base demonstrates desirable algorithmic properties, and together with the $D$-relation, it conveys essential properties of the underlying closure system. Hence, computing the $D$-base and the $D$-relation of a closure system from another representation is crucial to enjoy its benefits. However, complexity results for this task are lacking. In this paper, we give algorithms and hardness results for the computation of the $D$-base and $D$-relation. Specifically, we establish the $NP$-completeness of finding the $D$-relation from an arbitrary IB; we give an output-quasi-polynomial time algorithm to compute the $D$-base from meet-irreducible elements; and we obtain a polynomial-delay algorithm computing the $D$-base from an arbitrary IB. These results complete the picture regarding the complexity of identifying the $D$-base and $D$-relation of a closure system.

Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks for (Mixed-Integer) Quadratic Programs

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective preconditioner. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. However, the theoretical understanding of GNNs in this context remains limited. Specifically, it is unclear what GNNs can and cannot achieve for QP tasks in theory. This work addresses this gap in the context of linearly constrained QP tasks. In the continuous setting, we prove that message-passing GNNs can universally represent fundamental properties of convex quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions. In the more challenging mixed-integer setting, while GNNs are not universal approximators, we identify a subclass of QP problems that GNNs can reliably represent.

We study the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that any deterministic approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio depends only on $n$ requires at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.206})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.412})$ in all fixed dimensions.

Theoretical Insights into CycleGAN: Analyzing Approximation and Estimation Errors in Unpaired Data Generation
Luwei Sun, Dongrui Shen, Han Feng
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
In this paper, we focus on analyzing the excess risk of the unpaired data generation model, called CycleGAN. Unlike classical GANs, CycleGAN not only transforms data between two unpaired distributions but also ensures the mappings are consistent, which is encouraged by the cycle-consistency term unique to CycleGAN. The increasing complexity of model structure and the addition of the cycle-consistency term in CycleGAN present new challenges for error analysis. By considering the impact of both the model architecture and training procedure, the risk is decomposed into two terms: approximation error and estimation error. These two error terms are analyzed separately and ultimately combined by considering the trade-off between them. Each component is rigorously analyzed; the approximation error through constructing approximations of the optimal transport maps, and the estimation error through establishing an upper bound using Rademacher complexity. Our analysis not only isolates these errors but also explores the trade-offs between them, which provides a theoretical insights of how CycleGAN's architecture and training procedures influence its performance.

Twisted holography captures protected aspects of well-known holographic dualities. We show how the holographic dual B-model background can be systematically derived from the 't Hooft expansion of the chiral algebras associated to four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories. A crucial tool is the match of planar BRST anomalies in the field theory and on the worldsheet, especially in the presence of probe D-branes. Our construction is very general and can be applied to chiral algebras which do not have a four-dimensional origin. The resulting holographic dual backgrounds are typically non-geometric and appear to be novel. We expect our strategy to have a wide range of applications to other examples of twisted holography and, potentially, weak coupling holography.

Sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions is fundamental in machine learning and statistics. As datasets grow larger, computational efficiency becomes increasingly important, particularly in reducing adaptive complexity, namely the number of sequential rounds required for sampling algorithms. While recent works have introduced several parallelizable techniques, they often exhibit suboptimal convergence rates and remain significantly weaker than the latest lower bounds for log-concave sampling. To address this, we propose a novel parallel sampling method that improves adaptive complexity dependence on dimension $d$ reducing it from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^2 d)$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log d)$. which is even optimal for log-concave sampling with some specific adaptive complexity. Our approach builds on parallel simulation techniques from scientific computing.

Graphical model estimation from multi-omics data requires a balance between statistical estimation performance and computational scalability. We introduce a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes the target precision matrix while preserving the sparsity pattern and estimates it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework was tested using simulated data with up to one million variables, demonstrating complex dependency structures similar to those found in biological networks. Leveraging this scalability, we estimated a partial correlation network from a dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the ultrahigh-dimensional data demonstrated superior specificity in prioritizing key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of epigenetic regulation, thereby highlighting the value of computational scalability in multi-omic data analysis.

Optimization models have been applied to solve a wide variety of decision-making problems. These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.

Quantum algorithm for the gradient of a logarithm-determinant

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
The logarithm-determinant is an widely-present operation in many areas of physics and computer science. Derivatives of the logarithm-determinant compute physically relevant quantities in statistical physics models, quantum field theories, as well as the inverses of matrices. A multi-variable version of the quantum gradient algorithm is developed here to evaluate the derivative of the logarithm-determinant. From this, the inverse of a sparse-rank input operator may be determined efficiently. Measuring an expectation value of the quantum state--instead of all $N^2$ elements of the input operator--can be accomplished in $O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ time in the idealized case for $k$ relevant eigenvectors of the input matrix with precision $\varepsilon$. A practical implementation of the required operator will likely need $\log_2N$ overhead, giving an overall complexity of $O((k\log_2 N)/\varepsilon^2)$. The method applies widely and converges super-linearly in $k$ when the condition number is high. The best classical method we are aware of scales as $N$.
Given the same resource assumptions as other algorithms, such that an equal superposition of eigenvectors is available efficiently, the algorithm is evaluated in the practical case as $O(\log_2 N/\varepsilon^2)$. The output is given in $O(1)$ queries of oracle, which is given explicitly here and only relies on time-evolution operators that can be implemented with arbitrarily small error. The algorithm is envisioned for fully error-corrected quantum computers but may be implementable on near-term machines. We discuss how this algorithm can be used for kernel-based quantum machine-learning.

Physically consistent predictive reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints

Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.

We develop a form Thompson sampling for online learning under full feedback - also known as prediction with expert advice - where the learner's prior is defined over the space of an adversary's future actions, rather than the space of experts. We show regret decomposes into regret the learner expected a priori, plus a prior-robustness-type term we call excess regret. In the classical finite-expert setting, this recovers optimal rates. As an initial step towards practical online learning in settings with a potentially-uncountably-infinite number of experts, we show that Thompson sampling over the $d$-dimensional unit cube, using a certain Gaussian process prior widely-used in the Bayesian optimization literature, has a $\mathcal{O}\Big(\beta\sqrt{Td\log(1+\sqrt{d}\frac{\lambda}{\beta})}\Big)$ rate against a $\beta$-bounded $\lambda$-Lipschitz adversary.

Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

Classical unsupervised learning methods like clustering and linear dimensionality reduction parametrize large-scale geometry when it is discrete or linear, while more modern methods from manifold learning find low dimensional representation or infer local geometry by constructing a graph on the input data. More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.

Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model

The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm that finds approximate solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization, especially those that can be formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. In prior work, researchers have considered various ways of "warm-starting" QAOA by constructing an initial quantum state using classically-obtained solutions or information; these warm-starts typically cause QAOA to yield better approximation ratios at much lower circuit depths. For the Max-Cut problem, one warm-start approaches constructs the initial state using the high-dimensional vectors that are output from an SDP relaxation of the corresponding Max-Cut problem. This work leverages these semidefinite warmstarts for a broader class of problem instances by using a standard reduction that transforms any QUBO instance into a Max-Cut instance. We empirically compare this approach to a "QUBO-relaxation" approach that relaxes the QUBO directly. Our results consider a variety of QUBO instances ranging from randomly generated QUBOs to QUBOs corresponding to specific problems such as the traveling salesman problem, maximum independent set, and portfolio optimization. We find that the best choice of warmstart approach is strongly dependent on the problem type.

Virtual Contraction Approach to Decentralized Adaptive Stabilization of Nonlinear Time-Delayed Networks
Yu Kawano, Zhiyong Sun
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we exploit a diagonally dominant structure for the decentralized stabilization of unknown nonlinear time-delayed networks. To this end, we first introduce a novel generalization of virtual contraction analysis to diagonally dominant time-delayed control systems. We then show that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized using diagonal high-gains, provided that the input matrices satisfy certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant conditions. To enable stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, guaranteeing that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin while the gains converge to finite values. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is illustrated through a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.

Towards Quantifying the Hessian Structure of Neural Networks

Subjects:

Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs) exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation remains unclear. In this work, we reveal that the reported Hessian structure comes from a mixture of two forces: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a ''dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of ''static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models and 1-hidden-layer networks for classification tasks with $C$ classes. By leveraging random matrix theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C$ becomes large. Our findings reveal that $C$ is one primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models (LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$.

Wasserstein Convergence of Score-based Generative Models under Semiconvexity and Discontinuous Gradients

Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.

Dynamical Low-Rank Compression of Neural Networks with Robustness under Adversarial Attacks

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy. The method is model- and data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.

On the $O(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{K^{1/4}})$ Convergence Rate of AdamW Measured by $\ell_1$ Norm

Comments:

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
As the default optimizer for training large language models, AdamW has achieved remarkable success in deep learning. However, its convergence behavior is not theoretically well-understood. This paper establishes the convergence rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[||\nabla f(x^k)||_1\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{K^{1/4}})$ for AdamW measured by $\ell_1$ norm, where $K$ represents the iteration number, $d$ denotes the model dimension, and $C$ matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we have $||\nabla f(x)||_2\ll ||\nabla f(x)||_1\leq \sqrt{d}||\nabla f(x)||_2$ for any high-dimensional vector $x$ and $E\left[||\nabla f(x)||_1\right]\geq\sqrt{\frac{2d}{\pi}}E\left[||\nabla f(x)||_2\right]$ when each element of $\nabla f(x)$ is generated from Gaussian distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. Empirically, our experimental results on real-world deep learning tasks reveal $||\nabla f(x)||_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d})||\nabla f(x)||_2$. Both support that our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[||\nabla f(x^k)||_2\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD.

Absorb and Converge: Provable Convergence Guarantee for Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Models

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Signal Processing (eess.SP); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.

Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light

We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fröhlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.

GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD

Machine Learning (cs.LG); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.

The proliferation of low-precision units in modern high-performance architectures increasingly burdens domain scientists. Historically, the choice in HPC was easy: can we get away with 32 bit floating-point operations and lower bandwidth requirements, or is FP64 necessary? Driven by Artificial Intelligence, vendors introduce novel low-precision units for vector and tensor operations, and FP64 capabilities stagnate or are reduced. This forces scientists to re-evaluate their codes, but a trivial search-and-replace approach to go from FP64 to FP16 will not suffice.
We introduce RAPTOR: a numerical profiling tool to guide scientists in their search for code regions where precision lowering is feasible. Using LLVM, we transparently replace high-precision computations using low-precision units, or emulate a user-defined precision. RAPTOR is a novel, feature-rich approach -- with focus on ease of use -- to change, profile, and reason about numerical requirements and instabilities, which we demonstrate with four real-world multi-physics Flash-X applications.

The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.

We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.

Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As condensed matter physics applications, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices and analytically determine the asymptotics of the return probability. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.

In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately 70%.

A fundamental reform has been introduced in the 2024/25 season of club competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA): the well-established group stage has been replaced by an incomplete round-robin format. In this format, the 36 teams are ranked in a single league table, but play against only a subset of the competitors. While this innovative change has highlighted that the incomplete round-robin tournament is a reasonable alternative to the standard design of allocating the teams into round-robin groups, the characteristics of the new format remain unexplored. Our paper contributes to this topic by using simulations to compare the uncertainty generated by the draw in the old format with that in the new format of the UEFA Champions League. We develop a method to break down the impact of the 2024/25 reform into various components for each team. The new format is found to decrease the overall effect of the draw. However, this reduction can mainly be attributed to the inaccurate seeding system used by UEFA. If the teams are seeded based on their actual strengths, the impact of the draw is about the same in a tournament with an incomplete round-robin league or a group stage.

Canonical Representations of Markovian Structural Causal Models: A Framework for Counterfactual Reasoning
Lucas de Lara (IECL)
Subjects:
Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Counterfactual reasoning aims at answering contrary-to-fact questions like ``Would have Alice recovered had she taken aspirin?'' and corresponds to the most fine-grained layer of causation. Critically, while many counterfactual statements cannot be falsified-even by randomized experiments-they underpin fundamental concepts like individual-wise fairness. Therefore, providing models to formalize and implement counterfactual beliefs remains a fundamental scientific problem. In the Markovian setting of Pearl's causal framework, we propose an alternative approach to structural causal models to represent counterfactuals compatible with a given causal graphical model. More precisely, we introduce counterfactual models, also called canonical representations of structural causal models. They enable analysts to choose a counterfactual assumption via random-process probability distributions with preassigned marginals and characterize the counterfactual equivalence class of structural causal models. Using these representations, we present a normalization procedure to disentangle the (arbitrary and unfalsifiable) counterfactual choice from the (typically testable) interventional constraints. In contrast to structural causal models, this allows to implement many counterfactual assumptions while preserving interventional knowledge, and does not require any estimation step at the individual-counterfactual layer: only to make a choice. Finally, we illustrate the specific role of counterfactuals in causality and the benefits of our approach on theoretical and numerical examples.

A principled approach for comparing Variable Importance
Angel Reyero-Lobo, Pierre Neuvial, Bertrand Thirion
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Variable importance measures (VIMs) aim to quantify the contribution of each input covariate to the predictability of a given output. With the growing interest in explainable AI, numerous VIMs have been proposed, many of which are heuristic in nature. This is often justified by the inherent subjectivity of the notion of importance. This raises important questions regarding usage: What makes a good VIM? How can we compare different VIMs?
In this paper, we address these questions by: (1) proposing an axiomatic framework that bridges the gap between variable importance and variable selection. This framework formalizes the intuitive principle that features providing no additional information should not be assigned importance. It helps avoid false positives due to spurious correlations, which can arise with popular methods such as Shapley values; and (2) introducing a general pipeline for constructing VIMs, which clarifies the objective of various VIMs and thus facilitates meaningful comparisons. This approach is natural in statistics, but the literature has diverged from it.
Finally, we provide an extensive set of examples to guide practitioners in selecting and estimating appropriate indices aligned with their specific goals and data.

The goal of this thesis is to obtain new exact results for models of active particles in one dimension, focusing on two different aspects: their behavior in the presence of long-range interactions and their first-passage properties. In the first part we give an overview of existing exact results both for active particle models and for Brownian particles with long-range interactions (Riesz gases). The next two parts focus on how methods from these two fields can be combined and extended to derive new results for models of active particles with long-range interactions. In part two, we study the density of particles in the stationary state, in the limit where the number of particles is very large, using an extension of the Dean-Kawasaki equation to run-and-tumble particles (RTPs). In the case of the 1D Coulomb interaction (attractive or repulsive), we obtain exact expressions for the stationary density for different types of confining potentials, which sheds lights on new non-equilibrium phase-transitions. Some results are also obtained for a repulsive 2D Coulomb interaction (log-gas), although the single-file constraint makes the study more difficult in this case. In part three, we focus on the fluctuations at the tagged particle level. In the limit of weak noise, we compute exactly and analyze in different regimes a variety of correlation functions of the particle positions and interparticle distances, both for the Brownian Riesz gas and for its active counterpart, and show that the activity plays an important role both at short times and at small distances. The last part of this thesis focuses on Siegmund duality, which connects the first-passage properties of a stochastic process with absorbing boundaries to its spatial distribution with hard walls. We extend this duality to a new class of stochastic processes, which includes active particles and diffusing diffusivity models.

Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of integer programming models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.

In this paper we consider posterior Bayesian fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent weights. Particularly, if the likelihood is Gaussian, we identify the distribution of the wide width limit and provide an algorithm to sample from the network. In the shallow case we explicitly compute the distribution of the conditional output, proving that it is a Gaussian mixture. All the theoretical results are numerically validated.

Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.

Parameterized complexity of isometric path partition: treewidth and diameter

We investigate the parameterized complexity of the Isometric Path Partition problem when parameterized by the treewidth ($\mathrm{tw}$) of the input graph, arguably one of the most widely studied parameters. Courcelle's theorem shows that graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit FPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This encompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph problems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the graph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant size. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them, require individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story of parameterization by treewidth.
We prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when parameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by Dumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the aforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a tailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\mathrm{tw})}$ time. This dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{O(\mathrm{tw}^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the graph. Note that the dependency on treewidth is unusually high, as most problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(\mathrm{tw})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $2^{O(\mathrm{tw} \log (\mathrm{tw}))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. However, we rule out the possibility of a significantly faster algorithm by proving that Isometric Path Partition does not admit an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{o(\mathrm{tw}^2/(\log^3(\mathrm{tw})))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, unless the Randomized-ETH fails.

Discrete-Time Two-Strain Epidemic Dynamics on Complex Networks

We investigate a discrete-time two-strain symbiotic epidemic model on complex networks with both random and long-range interactions. Our analysis examines how the co-infection recovery rate ($\mu$), the long-range decay exponent ($\alpha$), and the scale-free connectivity exponent ($\gamma$) shape epidemic persistence under cooperative dynamics. Comparison with a two-strain competition model shows how these parameters control strain dominance, coexistence, or extinction. The results demonstrate that contagion dynamics are strongly affected by environmental randomness and long-range couplings. In facultative symbiosis, the co-infection recovery rate undergoes a clear phase transition, separating persistence from extinction. In the competitive setting, regimes with $\alpha < 2$ and $\gamma < 3$ markedly lower the epidemic threshold, allowing persistence even at small contagion rates ($\sigma$). Statistical analysis further reveals that $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ exert pronounced, nonlinear, and time-dependent effects on strain survival.

Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem

In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \& Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.

Optimizing Paths for Adaptive Fly-Scan Microscopy: An Extended Version
Yu Lu, Thomas F. Lynn, Ming Du, Zichao Di, Sven Leyffer
Subjects:
Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs, and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the next scan iteration.

Quantum carrollian bosonic strings

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Representation Theory (math.RT)
We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model à la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincaré duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.

Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems

Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis

This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the `power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty, making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a `safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps. One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden `power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design philosophies.

Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits

Subjects:

We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.

Rate doubly robust estimation for weighted average treatment effects
Yiming Wang, Yi Liu, Shu Yang
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
The weighted average treatment effect (WATE) defines a versatile class of causal estimands for populations characterized by propensity score weights, including the average treatment effect (ATE), treatment effect on the treated (ATT), on controls (ATC), and for the overlap population (ATO). WATE has broad applicability in social and medical research, as many datasets from these fields align with its framework. However, the literature lacks a systematic investigation into the robustness and efficiency conditions for WATE estimation. Although doubly robust (DR) estimators are well-studied for ATE, their applicability to other WATEs remains uncertain. This paper investigates whether widely used WATEs admit DR or rate doubly robust (RDR) estimators and assesses the role of nuisance function accuracy, particularly with machine learning. Using semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF) theory and double/debiased machine learning (DML), we propose three RDR estimators under specific rate and regularity conditions and evaluate their performance via Monte Carlo simulations. Applications to NHANES data on smoking and blood lead levels, and SIPP data on 401(k) eligibility, demonstrate the methods' practical relevance in medical and social sciences.

We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.
