Title:
Symmetry and Pseudosymmetry properties with Ricci soliton of the Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter spacetime
Absos Ali Shaikh, Kamiruzzaman
Comments:
35 pages
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
The primary objective of the article is to investigate the symmetry and pseudosymmetry properties of the Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter (briefly, RNdS) spacetime. The secondary aim of the paper is to explore the notion of Ricci solitons in RNdS spacetimes. The study is important due to the conceding of almost Ricci soliton and almost Ricci Yamabe soliton of the RNdS spacetime. The analysis shows that this spacetime satisfies multiple types of symmetric and pseudosymmetric conditions. It is interesting to note that RNdS spacetime reveled pseudosymmetry, conformal pseudosymmetry, Weyl projective pseudosymmetry, conharmonic pseudosymmetry, and concircular pseudosymmetry. Furthermore, in the RNdS spacetime, obtained by second order covariant derivatives $R\cdot R$ is linearly dependent on $Q(S,R)$ and $Q(g,C)$. It is demonstrated that the RNdS spacetime is 2-quasi Einstein and an Ein(2) space with recurrent conformal 2-forms. We derive the general form of the compatible tensors for this spacetime. The energy-momentum tensor of the RNdS spacetime is also shown to be pseudosymmetric and also the energy momentum tensor is pseudosymmetric due to conformal, conharmonic, concircular and projective curvature tensor. The energy momentum tensor is compatible with these curvature. We study a generalized notion of curvature inheritance and find that, with respect to the non-Killing vector fields $\partial/\partial r$ and $\partial/\partial \theta$, the RNdS spacetime does not satisfy these inheritance conditions. However, the RNdS spacetime is shown to admit an almost Ricci soliton and an almost $\eta$-Ricci Yamabe soliton with respect to the non-Killing vector field $\partial/\partial r$ but with respect to the non-Killing vector field $\partial/\partial \theta$ the spacetime does not admit such notions. Finally, we present a comparison between the RNdS and Vaidya-Bonner-de Sitter (VBdS) spacetimes.

Let $p>1$ be a large prime number, let $q=O(\log\log p)$ and let $1\leq a<q$ be a pair of relatively prime integers. It is proved that there is a prime primitive root $u\ll (\log p)(\log \log p)^5$ such that $u\equiv a\bmod q$ in the prime finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$.

Title:
The properties of general Fourier partial sums of functions $f \in C_L$
Giorgi Tutberidze, Vakhtang Tsagareishvili, Giorgi Cagareishvili
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties of Fourier partial sums associated with general orthonormal systems, focusing on functions that belong to specific differentiable function classes. While classical Fourier analysis has extensively studied trigonometric systems, our approach considers a broader class of orthonormal systems, including those adapted to weighted function spaces or arising from orthogonal polynomials. The primary objective is to analyze how the smoothness and differentiability of the function \( f \) affect the rate and nature of convergence of its Fourier partial sums. We derive estimates for the approximation error in various norms and establish sufficient conditions under which uniform or pointwise convergence occurs. In particular, we highlight how differentiability constraints on \( f \) can lead to sharper convergence results than those available for general \( L^2 \)-functions. Furthermore, we explore the impact of specific system properties, such as localization and boundedness, on the summation behavior. Several illustrative examples are provided, demonstrating the theoretical findings for commonly used orthonormal systems. Our results contribute to the deeper understanding of spectral approximations and have potential applications in numerical analysis, signal processing, and the theory of function spaces.

Initial Value Problems for Some Functional Equations and the PENLP
Hailu Bikila Yadeta
Comments:
34 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
In this paper, we study initial value problems for a class of functional equations. We introduce the concept of appropriate initial sets to enable the unique extension of an initial function into a solution defined over larger domains. Our analysis characterizes the structure and size of these initial sets, illustrating how functions specified on them can be uniquely extended to broader regions. Furthermore, we propose the Principle of Exclusion of Neighborhoods of Limit Points (PENLP)-a novel conceptual framework that elucidates the behavior of solutions near limit points and their impact on the extension process. We demonstrate that the initial sets must avoid the limit points of the functional equations to ensure uniqueness and well-posedness. The functional equations examined in this study include: $$ y(x+1)= y(bx),\quad b \neq 0, $$ $$ y(x)=y(2x),\quad y(x)=y(-2x),\quad y(3x)=y(x)+y(2x), $$ as well as the equations characterizing even functions and odd functions.

In this paper we prove and discuss some new $\left( H_{p},weak-L_{p}\right) $ type inequalities of maximal operators of $T$ means with respect to Vilenkin systems with monotone coefficients. We also apply these results to prove a.e. convergence of \ such $T$ means. It has also been proven that these results are the best possible in a special sense. As applications, both well-known and new results are highlighted.

In this brief article, we present the formula created by Rafael Barrett in 1903 in a note to Henri Poincaré, which remained unknown for decades. Once discovered in the 1930s by an Uruguayan mathematician, this formula was disseminated and analyzed in a journal published in Montevideo in 1935. In this study, we present Barrett's formula and discuss some of its challenges it may pose.

Title:
Conic optimization techniques yield sufficient conditions for set-completely positive matrix completion under arrowhead specification pattern
Markus Gabl
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
Matrix completion results deal with the question of when a partially specified symmetric matrix can be completed to a member of certain matrix cones. Results from positive semidefinite matrix completion and completely positive matrix completion have been successfully applied in optimization to greatly reduce the number of variables in conic optimization problems in the space of symmetric matrices. In this text, we go the other direction and show that we can use tools from conic optimization (more precisely: from copositive optimization) to establish a new completion result that complements the existing literature in two regards: firstly, we consider set-completely positive matrix completion, which generalizes completion with respect to the traditional completely positive matrix cone. Secondly, we consider a specification pattern that is not in the scope of classical results for completely positive matrix completion. Namely, we consider arrow-head specification patterns where the width is equal to one. Our theory is applied to a class of quadratic optimization problems.

Row completion of polynomial and rational matrices II
Agurtzane Amparan, Itziar Baragaña, Silvia Marcaida, Alicia Roca
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
We study the row completion problem of polynomial and rational matrices with partial prescription of the structural data. The prescription of the complete structural data has been solved in Amparan et al., Lin. Alg. Appl. 720 (2025) 109-138, where several results of prescription of some of the four types of invariants composing the structural data have also been obtained. In this paper we deal with the cases not analyzed there. More precisely, we solve the row completion problem of a rational or a polynomial matrix when we prescribe the infinite (finite) structure and the column and/or the row minimal indices, and when only the column and/or row minimal indices are prescribed. The necessity of the conditions obtained are valid over arbitrary fields, but in some cases the proof of the sufficiency requires working over algebraically closed fields. By transposition the results obtained hold for the corresponding column completion problems.

The Inverse Function Fallacy: On Sign Determination and Forgotten Fundamentals
Meliksah Yorulmazlar
Comments:
6 pages, 0 figures
Subjects:
History and Overview (math.HO)
Although inverse functions are introduced early in algebra, many students remain unaware that an inverse expression may legitimately involve a negative root. Instead, they default to assuming a positive root, overlooking the role of domain restrictions in determining the correct solution. This paper identifies this misconception as the "inverse function fallacy" and introduces a systematic approach, the Inverse Function Point method, that establishes sign determination to a single domain-based reference point. In a study of 69 STEM students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, only 19% solved a sign-determination problem correctly on their first attempt. Those students were not re-tested. Of the remaining 56 who answered incorrectly, I was able to re-test 40 after teaching the proposed method. In this subgroup, accuracy rose to 80%. These results highlight both the fragility of assumed mathematical knowledge and the potential of simple, intuitive procedures to reinforce conceptual understanding.

This work discusses an approach to solving geometric construction problems in which the given figure is included in a set ordered by construction steps. The flow of information is carried through the chain, allowing the original problem to be transformed and solved in a broader context. For demonstration, three classical tasks of construction are considered: proportional segments, a Gothic detail, and proportional angles.

Properties of Selector Proofs
Elijah Gadsby
Comments:
18 pages
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
A serial property is a suitably enumerated sequence $\{F_n\}$ of formulas and is called selector provable in PA if there is a PA-recursive function $s(x)$ such that PA $\vdash \forall x (s(x){:}_{\text{PA}} \ulcorner F_x\urcorner)$ where $x{:}_{\text{PA}} y$ is a suitable proof predicate. These notions were introduced by Artemov in his analysis of consistency and the formalisation of metamathematics. These matters aside, the notion is intimately connected with that of relative consistency.
This paper will give an overview of the mathematical properties of selector proofs. Topics include: the relationship between selector proofs, ordinary provability and the omega rule, the relationship between selector proofs and relative consistency, iterated selector proofs, and the complexity of selectors.

Evaluating the Infinite
Toby Ord
Comments:
25 pages
Subjects:
General Mathematics (math.GM)
I present a novel mathematical technique for dealing with the infinities arising from divergent sums and integrals. It assigns them fine-grained infinite values from the set of hyperreal numbers in a manner that refines the standard theories of summation and integration. This has implications in statistics (helping us work with distributions whose mean or variance is infinite), decision theory (allowing comparison of options with infinite expected values), economics (allowing evaluation of infinitely long streams of utility without discounting), and ethics (allowing evaluation of infinite worlds). There are even implications for finite cases, as the ability to handle these infinities undermines a common argument for bounded utility and the discounting of future utility.

Radon-Nikodym derivative of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation
Pantelis Tassopoulos, Sourav Sarkar
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of the spatial increments (with endpoints away from the origin) of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation (LPP) with non-decreasing initial data against the Wiener measure $\mu$ on compacts is in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$; and for any fixed $p>1$, the $L^p$ norm is at most of the order $O_p(\mathrm{e}^{d_pm^2\log m})$ for some $p$-dependent constant $d_p>0$.
Furthermore, when the initial data is homogeneous, we establish optimal growth on $L^p$ norms ($\asymp O(\exp(dm^2))$) of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the Brownian LPP (i.e. top line of an $m$-level Dyson Brownian motion) away from the origin, as the number of curves $m$ tends to infinity, for all $p>1$ sufficiently large.
As an application of our framework, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of certain toy models for the KPZ fixed point lies in $L^{\infty-}(\mu)$, inspired by its variational characterisation in terms of the directed landscape.

Quantitative Brownian regularity of the KPZ fixed point with meagre initial data

We show that the spatial increments of the KPZ fixed point starting from initial data that is locally bounded and whose support admits $\epsilon$-coverings with moderate growth, exhibit strong quantitative comparison against rate two Brownian motion on compacts. The above estimates are uniform on the $L^p$ norms, the compact set containing the support of the initial data and the length of the interval considered.

Existence of flat flows for volume-preserving mean curvature flow with contact angle
Jiwoong Jang
Comments:
24 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We study the motion of a droplet evolving by mean curvature with volume constraint and contact angle condition on a half space. We prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution, called the flat flow. A difficulty arises when we establish the local-in-time equi-boundedness of approximate solutions and a uniform $L^2$-estimate of multipliers. The difficulty is handled by conducting blowup analysis at a point in contact to a spherical cap with sharp angle.

Quantum Harmonic Analysis and the Structure in Data: Augmentation

Comments:
13 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this short note, we study the impact of data augmentation on the smoothness of principal components of high-dimensional datasets. Using tools from quantum harmonic analysis, we show that eigenfunctions of operators corresponding to augmented data sets lie in the modulation space $M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, guaranteeing smoothness and continuity. Numerical examples on synthetic and audio data confirm the theoretical findings. While interesting in itself, the results suggest that manifold learning and feature extraction algorithms can benefit from systematic and informed augmentation principles.

PySymmetry: A Sage/Python Framework for the Symmetry Reduction of Linear G-Equivariant Systems
Leon D. da Silva, Marcelo P. Santos
Subjects:
Group Theory (math.GR); Symbolic Computation (cs.SC); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Representation Theory (math.RT)
Despite the prevalence of symmetry in scientific linear systems, these structural properties are often underutilized by standard computational software. This paper introduces PySymmetry, an open-source Sage/Python framework that implements classical representation theory to simplify G-equivariant linear systems. PySymmetry uses projection operators to generate symmetry-adapted bases, transforming equivariant operators into a more efficient block-diagonal form. Its functionalities include defining and reducing representations, calculating multiplicities, and obtaining the explicit block structure.
We demonstrate PySymmetry's versatility through three case studies: a chemistry application, a numerical benchmark on the non-Hermitian Schrödinger equation that achieved a performance increase of over 17x compared to standard methods, and a symbolic investigation that enabled the first complete analytical classification of a challenging problem in celestial mechanics. Designed for seamless integration with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, PySymmetry offers a powerful, user-friendly tool for exploring symmetries in theoretical and applied contexts. ```

Operator Algebras (math.OA)
In this paper we prove that whenever $G$ is hyperbolic relative to a family of exact, ressidually finite subgroups $\{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, the corresponding von Neumann algebra $\mathcal L(G)$ is solid relative to the family of subalgebras $\{\mathcal L(H_1),\ldots ,\mathcal L(H_n)\}$. Building on this result and combining it with findings from geometric group theory, we construct a continuum of icc property (T) relative hyperbolic groups that give rise to pairwise non virtually isomorphic factors, each of which has trivial one-sided fundamental semigroup.

Stability of high-order Scott-Vogelius elements for 2D non-Newtonian incompressible flow
Charles Parker, Endre Süli
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We consider the stability of high-order Scott-Vogelius elements for 2D non-Newtonian incompressible flow problems. For elements of degree 4 or higher, we construct a right-inverse of the divergence operator that is stable uniformly in the polynomial degree $N$ from $L^p$ to $\boldsymbol{W}^{1,p}$, show that the associated inf-sup constant is bounded below by a constant that decays at worst like $N^{-3\left| \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}\right|}$, and construct local Fortin operators with stability constants explicit in the polynomial degree. We demonstrate these results with several numerical examples suggesting that the $p$-version method can offer superior convergence rates over the $h$-version method even in the non-Newtonian setting.

Hierarchical null controllability of a degenerate parabolic equation with nonlocal coefficient
Juan Límaco, João Carlos Barreira, Suerlan Silva, Luis P. Yapu
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper we use a Stackelberg-Nash strategy to show the local null controllability of a parabolic equation where the diffusion coefficient is the product of a degenerate function in space and a nonlocal term. We consider one control called \textit{leader} and two controls called \textit{followers}. To each leader we associate a Nash equilibrium corresponding to a bi-objective optimal control problem; then, we find a leader that solves the null controllability problem. The linearized degenerated system is treated adapting Carleman estimates for degenerated systems from Demarque, Límaco and Viana \cite{DemarqueLimacoViana_deg_sys2020} and the local controllability of the non-linear system is obtained using Liusternik's inverse function theorem. The nonlocal coefficient originates a multiplicative coupling in the optimality system that gives rise to interesting calculations in the applications of the inverse function theorem.

Property B: A Baumgartner-style Property that Applies to Preservation of $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_2$ under Iterations with Supports of Size $\aleph_1$
Mirna Džamonja
Comments:
A version submitted for publication
Subjects:
Logic (math.LO)
We prove a theorem on iterated forcing that can be used for preservation of $\aleph_2$ and $\aleph_1$ in iterations with supports of size $\aleph_1$ of forcings that have amalgamation properties similar to those present in the perfect set forcing. The work is modelled after Baumgartner's Axiom A and his proof that iterations with countable support of the same preserve $\aleph_1$. In honour of James E. Baumgartner, the property introduced here is called Property B$(\kappa)$. The known additional difficulties when forcing at cardinals higher than $\aleph_1$ make for a less general theorem and a more complex theorem on the iteration, which is not an iteration theorem in the classical sense.
The results extend to other cardinals $\kappa$ such that $\kappa^{<\kappa}=\kappa$, in place of $\aleph_1$. We give examples of individual forcings that have Property B$(\kappa)$ and their products. In particular, we introduce a correct version of the generalised Prikry forcing, which we call Perfect Set Forcing with Respect to a Filter and give its basic properties.

Driverless vehicles are complex systems operating in constantly changing environments. Automated driving is achieved by controlling the coupled longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. Model predictive control is one of the most promising tools for this type of application due to its optimal performance and ability to handle constraints. This paper addresses autonomous driving with an adaptive linear parameter varying model predictive controller (LPV-MPC), which is adapted by a neural network and optimized by an improved Genetic Algorithm. The proposed controller is evaluated on a challenging track under variable wind disturbance. Code can be found here: this https URL

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Autonomous driving is achieved by controlling the coupled nonlinear longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. Longitudinal control greatly affects lateral dynamics and must preserve lateral stability conditions, while lateral controllers must take into account actuator limits and ride comfort. This work deals with the coordinated longitudinal and lateral control for autonomous driving. An improved particle swarm optimized PID (PSO-PID) is proposed to handle the task of speed tracking based on nonlinear longitudinal dynamics. An enhanced linear parameter varying model predictive controller (LPV-MPC) is also designed to control lateral dynamics, the latter is formulated with an adaptive LPV model in which the tire cornering stiffness coefficients are estimated by a recursive estimator. The proposed LPV-MPC is enhanced with an improved cost function to provide better performance and stability. Matlab/Carsim co-simulations are carried out to validate the proposed controllers.

Markovian families for pseudo-Anosov flows
Ioannis Iakovoglou
Comments:
191 pages, 55 figures
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Generalizing the classification approach described for transitive Anosov flows in dimension 3 in a previous preprint of the author, in this paper we describe a method for classifying (not necessarily transitive) pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds up to orbital equivalence. To every pseudo-Anosov flow $\Phi$ (with no 1-prongs) on $M^3$ is associated a bifoliated plane $\mathcal{P}$ endowed with an action of $\pi_1(M)$. It is known that the previous action characterizes $\Phi$ up to orbital equivalence and admits infinitely many Markovian families (i.e. collections of rectangles in $\mathcal{P}$ generalizing the notion of Markov partition for group actions on the plane). Our goal in this paper consists in showing that :
1) if $\mathcal{R}$ is a Markovian family of $\Phi$, the number of orbits of rectangles of $\mathcal{R}$ and their pattern of intersection can be encoded by a finite combinatorial object, called a geometric type, which describes completely $\Phi$ up to Dehn-Goodman-Fried surgeries on a specific finite set $\Gamma$ of periodic orbits of $\Phi$
2) our previous choices of surgeries on $\Gamma$ can be read as sequences of rectangles in $\mathcal{R}$ and can be encoded by finite combinatorial objects, called cycles
3) a geometric type with cycles of $\mathcal{R}$ describes the original flow $\Phi$ up to orbital equivalence
Several of the above results will be stated and proven in a slightly more general setting involving strong Markovian actions on the plane. Finally, due to the lack of bibliographic references on pseudo-Anosov flows in dimension 3, in the first part of the paper we provide an introduction to pseudo-Anosov flow theory containing several useful results for our classification approach together with their proofs.

Nearly Optimal Chaotic Desynchronization of Neural Oscillators

Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Motivated by deep brain stimulation treatment of neural disorders such as Parkinson's disease, it has been proposed that desynchronization of neural oscillators can be achieved by maximizing the Lyapunov exponent of the phase difference between pairs of oscillators. Here we consider two approximations to optimal stimuli for chaotic desynchronization of neural oscillators. These approximations are based on the oscillators' phase response curve, and unlike previous approaches do not require numerical solution of a two-point boundary value problem. It is shown that these approximations can achieve nearly optimal desynchronization, and can be used with an event-based control scheme to desynchronize populations of noisy, coupled neurons.

An eternal dominating family of graph $G$ in the eviction game is a collection $\mathcal{D}_{k}=\{D_{1},...,D_{l}\}$ of dominating sets of $G$ such that (a) $|D_{i}|=|D_{j}|$ for all $i,j\in\{1,2,...,l\}$, and (b) for any $i\in \{1,2,...,l\}$ and any $v\in D_{i}$, either all neighbours of $v$ belong to $D_{i}$, or there are a neighbour $w$ of $v$ not in $D_{i}$ and an integer $j\in\{1,2,...,l\}\setminus\{i\}$ such that $D_{i}\cup\{w\}\setminus \{v\}=D_{j}$. The eviction number of $G$, denoted by $e^{\infty}(G)$, is the smallest cardinality of the sets in such an eternal dominating family.
We compare $e^{\infty}$ to the independence number $\alpha$. We show that the ratio $\alpha/e^{\infty}$ is unbounded and construct an infinite class of connected graphs for which $e^{\infty}/\alpha \approx 4/3$. As our main result, we use Ramsey numbers to show that for any integer $k\geq1$, there exists a function $f(k)$ such that any graph with independence number $k$ has eviction number at most $f(k)$.

These are motivic lifts of Mahowald and Kane's splitting of $BP \langle 1 \rangle \wedge BP \langle 1 \rangle$. These splittings are given in terms of motivic Adams covers and constructed over the base fields $\mC, \, \mR,$ and $\mF_q$, where $\textup{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) \neq p$. As an application, we compute the $E_1$-page of the $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$-based Adams spectral sequence as a module over $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$, both in homotopy and in terms of motivic spectra. We also record analogous splittings for $BPGL \langle 0 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 0 \rangle$.

Spectral theory of matrix-sequences: perspectives of the GLT analysis and beyond
Stefano Serra-Capizzano
Comments:

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In recent years there has been a growing attention on distribution results in the sense of Weyl for the collective behavior of eigenvalues and singular values of matrix-sequences. Starting from the work of Szegö regarding the case of Toeplitz matrix-sequences, there has been a wealth of associated results, which culminated in the works of Tilli and of Tyrtyshnikov, Zamarashkin, and of the author for preconditioned and non-preconditioned $r$-block $d$-level Toeplitz matrix-sequences with Lebesgue integrable generating functions. In the latter the use of matrix-valued linear positive operators and related Korovkin theories has been crucial. The subsequent steps induced by the analysis of preconditioning techniques and inspired by the rich world of the (pseudo) differential operators have been studies from the same perspective of matrix-sequences with hidden (asymptotic) structure, widely studied in the literature. The widest generalization is represented by the notion of generalized locally Toeplitz matrix-sequences, which have inherent hidden structure and which include virtually any approximation via local numerical methods of (systems of) integral equations, partial and fractional differential equations, also with nonsmooth variable coefficients and irregular bounded/unbounded domains/manifolds.
In the current work, instead of focusing on a specific type of results, starting from the most recent advances on the topic, we describe shortly a series of open problems, challenges to be developed in the future.

Geometric Topology (math.GT); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Strata of translation surfaces are covered by the closures of finitely many iso-Delaunay regions: open subspaces parametrizing surfaces whose Delaunay triangulations are combinatorially equivalent. We prove that the iso-Delaunay regions for triangulations with involutions called triangle matchings are convex with respect to the angle coordinates of the triangles. As a corollary, we show that all iso-Delaunay regions in hyperelliptic stratum components are convex. This work generalizes two directions in the theory of flat surfaces.

Design, modeling and control of a hybrid grid-connected photovoltaic-wind system for the region of Adrar, Algeria

Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The use of fossil energy for electricity production is an evident source of pollution, global warming and climate change. Consequently, researchers have been working to shift toward sustainable and clean energy by exploiting renewable an environmentally friendly resources such as wind and solar energies. On the other hand, energy security can only be achieved by considering multiple resources. Large-scale renewable energy power plants are a key solution for diversifying the total energy mix and ensuring energy security. This paper presents a contribution to diversify the energy mix in Algeria and help mitigate power shortages and improve grid performance. In particular, the paper aims at designing and modeling a large-scale hybrid photovoltaic-wind system that is grid connected. An innovative control approach using improved particle swarm optimized PI controllers is proposed to control the hybrid system and generate the maximum power from the available wind and solar energy resources. Furthermore, economic, environmental and feasibility studies of the project were conducted using HOMER software to assess the viability of the system and its contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Inexact and Stochastic Gradient Optimization Algorithms with Inertia and Hessian Driven Damping
Harsh Choudhary, Jalal Fadili, Vyachelav Kungurtsev
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
In a real Hilbert space setting, we study the convergence properties of an inexact gradient algorithm featuring both viscous and Hessian driven damping for convex differentiable optimization. In this algorithm, the gradient evaluation can be subject to deterministic and stochastic perturbations. In the deterministic case, we show that under appropriate summability assumptions on the perturbation, our algorithm enjoys fast convergence of the objective values, of the gradients and weak convergence of the iterates toward a minimizer of the objective. In the stochastic case, assuming the perturbation is zero-mean, we can weaken our summability assumptions on the error variance and provide fast convergence of the values both in expectation and almost surely. We also improve the convergence rates from $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ to $o(\cdot)$ in almost sure sense. We also prove almost sure summability property of the gradients, which implies the almost sure fast convergence of the gradients towards zero. We will highlight the trade-off between fast convergence and the applicable regime on the sequence of errors in the gradient computations. We finally report some numerical results to support our findings.

We describe a unified and computationally tractable framework for finding outliers in, and maximum-diversity subsets of, finite metric spaces of strict negative type. Examples of such spaces include finite subsets of Euclidean space and finite subsets of a sphere without antipodal points. The latter accounts for state-of-the-art text embeddings, and we apply our framework in this context to sketch a hallucination mitigation strategy and separately to a class of path diversity optimization problems with a real-world example.

The problem of estimating the information rate distortion perception function (RDPF), which is a relevant information-theoretic quantity in goal-oriented lossy compression and semantic information reconstruction, is investigated here. Specifically, we study the RDPF tradeoff for Gaussian sources subject to a mean-squared error (MSE) distortion and a perception measure that belongs to the family of {\alpha} divergences. Assuming a jointly Gaussian RDPF, which forms a convex optimization problem, we characterize an upper bound for which we find a parametric solution. We show that evaluating the optimal parameters of this parametric solution is equivalent to finding the roots of a reduced exponential polynomial of degree {\alpha}. Additionally, we determine which disjoint sets contain each root, which enables us to evaluate them numerically using the well-known bisection method. Finally, we validate our analytical findings with numerical results and establish connections with existing results.

We prove convergence of eigenvector processes of the form $(\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{u}_k,A_t\mathbf{u}_k\rangle)_{t\in[0,1]}$ where $\mathbf{u}_k$ is a bulk eigenvector of generalized Wigner matrices and $(A_t)$ a family of symmetric matrices with bounded norm and Hölder regularity. We give explicit examples of limiting processes and prove that a large class of Gaussian process with Hölder-continuous covariance function can be obtained as such a limit using its Karhunen--Loève expansion. The proof is based on the multi-dimensional convergence proved Benigni and Cipolloni (2024) and a tightness criterion proved using Hölder regularity of the observables.

Efficient $\varepsilon$-approximate minimum-entropy couplings
Spencer Compton
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)
Given $m \ge 2$ discrete probability distributions over $n$ states each, the minimum-entropy coupling is the minimum-entropy joint distribution whose marginals are the same as the input distributions. Computing the minimum-entropy coupling is NP-hard, but there has been significant progress in designing approximation algorithms; prior to this work, the best known polynomial-time algorithms attain guarantees of the form $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + c$, where $c \approx 0.53$ for $m=2$, and $c \approx 1.22$ for general $m$ [CKQGK '23].
A main open question is whether this task is APX-hard, or whether there exists a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). In this work, we design an algorithm that produces a coupling with entropy $H(\operatorname{ALG}) \le H(\operatorname{OPT}) + \varepsilon$ in running time $n^{O(\operatorname{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \operatorname{exp}(m) )}$: showing a PTAS exists for constant $m$.

Computing Resilience Measures in Dynamical Systems
Andreas Morr, Christian Kuehn, George Datseris
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Resilience broadly describes a quality of withstanding perturbations. Measures of system resilience have gathered increasing attention across applied disciplines, yet existing metrics often lack computational accessibility and generalizability. In this work, we review the literature on resilience measures through the lens of dynamical systems theory and numerical methods. In this context, we reformulate pertinent measures into a general form and introduce a resource-efficient algorithm designed for their parallel numerical estimation. By coupling these measures with a global continuation of attractors, we enable their consistent evaluation along system parameter changes. The resulting framework is modular and easily extendable, allowing for the incorporation of new resilience measures as they arise. We demonstrate the framework on a range of illustrative dynamical systems, revealing key differences in how resilience changes across systems. This approach provides a more global perspective compared to traditional linear stability metrics used in local bifurcation analysis, which can overlook inconspicuous but significant shifts in system resilience. This work opens the door to genuinely novel lines of inquiry, such as the development of new early warning signals for critical transitions or the discovery of universal scaling behaviours. All code and computational tools are provided as an open-source contribution to the this http URL software library.

Condorcet domains are subsets of permutations arising in voting theory: regarding their permutations as preference orders on a list of candidates, one avoids Condorcet's paradox when aggregating the preferences via a simple majority relation. We use poset theory to show that, for the subclass of Condorcet domains of tiling type, the majority rule has stronger properties. We then develop techniques to predict the majority rule explicitly for the uniform vote tally on Condorcet domains of tiling type, and apply this to several well-known examples.

Mean-field limits in interacting particle systems with symmetric superlinear rates

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
We derive the exchange-driven growth (EDG) equations as the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems on the complete graph. Extending previous work, we consider symmetric exchange kernels $c(k, l) = c(l, k)$ satisfying super-linear bounds of the form $c(k, l) \leq C(k^{\mu}l^{\nu} + k^{\nu}l^{\mu})$, with $0 \leq \mu, \nu \leq 2$ and $\mu + \nu \leq 3$. Under these conditions the EDG equations are known to have global solutions. We establish a law of large numbers for the empirical measures, showing that the solutions of the EDG equation describe the limiting distribution of cluster sizes in the particle system. Furthermore, we analyse the dynamics of tagged particles and prove convergence to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process governed by a nonlinear master equation, derived via a law of large numbers for size-biased empirical processes.

Some of the performance results at large scale supercomputing installations produced Exascale-level compute throughput numbers thus proving the viability of the proposed benchmark for evaluating such machines. We also present the potential of the benchmark to continue increasing its use with proliferation of hardware accelerators for AI workloads whose reliable evaluation continues to pose a particular challenge for the users.

Let $N$ be a closed submanifold of a complete manifold, $M$. Then under certain topological conditions, there exists an orthogonal geodesic chord beginning and ending in $N$. In this paper we establish an upper bound for the length of such a geodesic chord in terms of geometric bounds on $M$. For example, if $N$ is a $2$-dimensional sphere embedded in a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold, then there exists an orthogonal geodesic chord in $M$ with endpoints on $N$ that has length at most $$ (4d+96D +8232\sqrt{A})(2n+1) $$ where $d$ is the diameter of $M$, and $A$ and $D$ are the area and intrinsic diameter of $N$, respectively.

Automatic Structure Identification for Highly Nonlinear MIMO Volterra Tensor Networks
Eva Memmel, Kim Batselier
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The Volterra Tensor Network lifts the curse of dimensionality for truncated, discrete times Volterra models, enabling scalable representation of highly nonlinear system. This scalability comes at the cost of introducing randomness through initialization, and leaves open the challenge of how to efficiently determine the hyperparameters model order and memory length. In this paper, we present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges: We derive two algorithms that incrementally increase the model order and memory length along. Further we proof that the updates are performed along conjugate directions by establishing a mathematical equivalence between our proposed algorithms and equality constrained least squares systems. We present several strategies how to use our proposed algorithms for initialization and hyperparameter selection. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art Volterra Tensor Network and achieve competitive results to several state-of-the-art Volterra models.

Water resource management is vital for sustainable irrigation and food security under growing climatic and economic pressures. In this study, we develop two single-objective optimization models for irrigation planning, one that maximizes net benefit and the other that minimizes environmental flow deficiency, and benchmark them against previous works. We then extend the analysis to a multiobjective linear programming formulation solved through different approaches to evaluate trade-offs. Numerical experiments on the Muhuri Irrigation Project reveal three outcomes: (i) a complete scenario view with profits ranging from $0.2 \times 10^9$ to $1.497\times 10^9$ and environmental flow deficits between 0 and 1200 GL, where the 1200 GL represents the theoretical annual maximum under a 100 GL uniform monthly target; (ii) explicit trade-offs showing higher profits correspond to greater ecological shortfalls; and (iii) an integration-based approach producing nearly 1000 Pareto-optimal solutions within seconds, greatly outperforming earlier studies.

The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-Hölder filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

We study the notion of semistability for principal bundles over curves with possibly disconnected structure group.

A key ingredient is our identification of the rational characters of any linear algebraic group with the Weyl-invariant rational characters of a maximal torus. In the reductive case, we prove an analogous statement for integral cocharacters. As an application, we extend the recursive description of Kirwan stratifications in Geometric Invariant Theory to disconnected groups, and use it in our study semistability for principal bundles.

Green Inventory Management: Leveraging Multiobjective Reverse Logistics

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The paper proposes a novel Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) inventory model within a reverse logistics framework, addressing new and repaired products with varying quality and demand patterns. The model integrates production and remanufacturing rates as functions of lot sizes and cycle numbers to develop a feasible inventory cost function. A key contribution of the study is formulating a multiobjective optimization framework that simultaneously minimizes inventory costs and accounts for environmental sustainability by considering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption during production processes. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, with integer constraints on lot sizes and cycle counts and a continuous return rate. Numerical case studies taking test problems from existing literature are used to validate the model through extensive sensitivity analyses. Both mathematical optimization and heuristic optimization methods are applied to solve multiobjective optimization problems, and Pareto fronts are illustrated along with the interpretation of the results. The results, obtained using solvers in MATLAB and AMPL, highlight the models ability to balance operational efficiency and environmental responsibility. Pareto frontiers generated from the analysis provide strategic insights for decision-makers seeking to optimize cost and sustainability in inventory systems.

Here we extend the inequalities by these authors to Jack and Macdonald polynomials, and obtain conjectural characterizations of majorization and of weak majorization of the underlying partitions. We prove these characterizations for several cases of partitions, including all partitions with two parts. In fact, we upgrade -- and prove in the above cases -- the characterization of majorization, to containment of Jack and Macdonald differences lying in the Muirhead semiring.

Efficient Online Large-Margin Classification via Dual Certificates

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Online classification is a central problem in optimization, statistical learning and data science. Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in accuracy.

Stochastically Evolving Graphs via Edit Semigroups

Comments:

Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We investigate a randomly evolving process of subgraphs in an underlying host graph using the spectral theory of semigroups related to the Tsetlin library and hyperplane arrangements. Starting with some initial subgraph, at each iteration, we apply a randomly selected edit to the current subgraph. Such edits vary in nature from simple edits consisting of adding or deleting an edge, or compound edits which can affect several edges at once. This evolving process generates a random walk on the set of all possible subgraphs of the host graph. We show that the eigenvalues of this random walk can be naturally indexed by subsets of edges of the host graph. We also provide, in the case of simple edits, a closed-form formula for the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix and a sharp bound for the rate of convergence of this random walk. We consider extensions to the case of compound edits; examples of this model include the previously studied Moran forest model and a dynamic random intersection graph model. Evolving graphs arise in a variety of fields ranging from deep learning and graph neural networks to epidemic modeling and social networks. Our random evolving process serves as a general stochastic model for sampling random subgraphs from a given graph.

A Riemannian AdaGrad-Norm Method

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose a manifold AdaGrad-Norm method (\textsc{MAdaGrad}), which extends the norm version of AdaGrad (AdaGrad-Norm) to Riemannian optimization. In contrast to line-search schemes, which may require several exponential map computations per iteration, \textsc{MAdaGrad} requires only one. Assuming the objective function $f$ has Lipschitz continuous Riemannian gradient, we show that the method requires at most $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations to compute a point $x$ such that $\|\operatorname{grad} f(x)\|\leq \varepsilon$. Under the additional assumptions that $f$ is geodesically convex and the manifold has sectional curvature bounded from below, we show that the method takes at most $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ to find $x$ such that $f(x)-f_{low}\leq\epsilon$, where $f_{low}$ is the optimal value. Moreover, if $f$ satisfies the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition globally on the manifold, we establish a complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$, provided that the norm of the initial Riemannian gradient is sufficiently large. For the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices, we construct a family of nonconvex functions satisfying the PL condition. Numerical experiments illustrate the remarkable performance of \textsc{MAdaGrad} in comparison with Riemannian Steepest Descent equipped with Armijo line-search.

We also show that in the case of $n=5$, respectively $n=6$, the only failure is for $[1;2]$, respectively $[1;3]$. Along the way we also prove that for any finite simple non-abelian group, all potential signatures with quotient genus greater than $1$ are actual signatures.

Higher order weighted Dirichlet type spaces with poly-superharmonic weights and Dirichlet type operators of finite order

Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Complex Variables (math.CV)
We study higher-order weighted Dirichlet integral and weighted Dirichlet type spaces $\mathscr D_{w,k}$ where the associated admissible weights arise from a class of positive poly-superharmonic functions on the open unit disc. We establish a generalized higher order version of the Local Douglas formula for computing the higher order weighted Dirichlet integral induced by Dirac measures supported on the open unit disc. Building on this formula, we analyze the properties of the multiplication operator $M_z$ acting on $\mathscr D_{w,k},$ proving that it is completely hyperexpansive of order $k$ for odd $k$ and completely hypercontractive of order $k$ for even $k$. To unify these cases, we introduce Dirichlet-type operators of finite order and construct model spaces corresponding to allowable tuples. This framework yields a model theorem for cyclic Dirichlet type operators of finite order, thereby extending well known model of cyclic completely hyperexpansive operators and the model of cyclic $m$-isometries.

Scattering of plane waves

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We formulate a problem that can be viewed as a natural variation of the so-called Pompeiu or Schiffer problem in the context of scattering of plane waves for the Linear Helmholtz equation. For the two dimensional version of this variation, we establish conditions on the wave numbers and incident directions, that ensure a non-vanishing scattered field.

ALNS for Tugboat Scheduling in Inland Waterway
Zihang Ma
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)
This paper focuses on the barges shipping problem, also known as the tugboats scheduling problem, within the context of a scenario where a single tugboat has the capacity to tow multiple barges and conduct multiple trips in a drop-and-pull mode during a daily work shift. The problem is mathematically formalized as mixed-integer programming models. To tackle real-world-sized problem instances, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm integrated with a decoding mathematical model is proposed. When applied to large-scale instances, the ALNS algorithm showcases performance superiority over the strengthened mathematical model.

Let $u(x)$ be a subpolynomial function in a Hardy field. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the weighted uniform distribution of the sequences $(u(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(u(p_n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $p_n$ denotes the $n$-th prime. This extends the main result of [4] to the weighted setting and leads to new applications in uniform distribution theory, ergodic theory, and additive combinatorics.

Preconditioning via Randomized Range Deflation (RandRAND)
Oleg Balabanov, Caleb Ju, Kaiwen He, Aryaman Jeendgar, Michael W. Mahoney
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We introduce RandRAND, a new class of randomized preconditioning methods for large-scale linear systems. RandRAND deflates the spectrum via efficient orthogonal projections onto random subspaces, without computing eigenpairs or low-rank approximations. This leads to advantages in computational cost and numerical stability. We establish rigorous condition number bounds that depend only weakly on the problem size and that reduce to a small constant when the dimension of the deflated subspace is comparable to the effective spectral dimension. RandRAND can be employed without explicit operations with the deflation basis, enabling the effective use of fast randomized transforms. In this setting, the costly explicit basis orthogonalization is bypassed by using fast randomized Q-less QR factorizations or iterative methods for computing orthogonal projections. These strategies balance the cost of constructing RandRAND preconditioners and applying them within linear solvers, and can ensure robustness to rounding errors.

High-order Multiscale Preconditioner for Elasticity of Arbitrary Structures
Sabit Mahmood Khan, Yashar Mehmani
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
We present a two-level preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of the elliptic, linear-elastic deformation equation, in displacement unknowns, over domains that have arbitrary geometric and topological complexity and heterogeneity in material properties (including fractures). The preconditioner is an algebraic translation of the high-order pore-level multiscale method (hPLMM) proposed recently by the authors, wherein a domain is decomposed into non-overlapping subdomains, and local basis functions are numerically computed over the subdomains to construct a high-quality coarse space (or prolongation matrix). The term "high-order" stands in contrast to the recent low-order PLMM preconditioner, where BCs of local basis problems assume rigidity of all interfaces shared between subdomains. In hPLMM, interfaces are allowed to deform, through the use of suitable mortar spaces, thereby capturing local bending/twisting moments under challenging loading conditions. Benchmarked across a wide range of complex (porous) structures and material heterogeneities, we find hPLMM exhibits superior performance in Krylov solvers than PLMM, as well as state-of-the-art Schwarz and multigrid preconditioners. Applications include risk analysis of subsurface CO2/H2 storage and optimizing porous materials for batteries, prosthetics, and aircraft.

We study an attractive Hubbard model on bipartite lattices. In the grand canonical formalism,we prove the existence of superconducting long-range order in the ground state with the chemical potential corresponding to half filling. We also study the low-energy excitations above several ground states for the translationally invariant Hamiltonian. We prove the following: (i) The pairing excitations are gapless above the ground states when the number of fermions deviates from that of the half filling by the order of the volume. (ii) A certain class of single-fermion excitations shows a non-vanishing spectral gap above the ground state with an even number of fermions in a strong coupling and low-density regime.

$H$-based Quivers with potentials and their representations
Xiaoyue Lin
Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT)
We generalize Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky's theory of quivers with potentials (QPs) to an $H$-based setting by considering quivers with exactly one loop at each vertex, asking the loops to be nilpotent and so attaching a truncated polynomial ring $H_i$ to each vertex. The algebra is then defined by taking the quotient of the complete path algebra by relations arising from analogs of the Jacobian ideals of a given potential. We develop the mutation theory for such $H$-based QPs and their decorated representations in general position. As an application, we consider generalized cluster algebras introduced by Chekhov-Shapiro. For those algebras corresponding to $H$-based quivers $(Q,\mathbf{d})$ that have mutation degree $d_k\leq 2$ at each vertex $k$ and admit nondegenerate potentials $S$ making $(Q,\mathbf{d},S)$ locally free, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation of $\mathbf{g}$-vectors and $F$-polynomials. When the exchange matrix $B(Q)$ has full rank, we further construct generic character for upper generalized cluster algebras.

As an extension of the Hilbert transform, which characterizes the spacetime conformally invariant integral transform, we show that, based on the Bhabha theory, a spin-dependent conformally invariant integral transform can be written as a product of the spin-independent integral transform and the Casimir operator of the corresponding conformal group. In contrast to an ordinary context, where spacetime translation symmetry is assumed, we introduce an intrinsic momentum operator, by which the Casimir operator turns out to be spacetime dependent (spin-orbit coupling, Pauli-Lubanski pseudo vector, and the like). We also show that the physical state annihilated by the intrinsic momentum operator represents a spin-s state.

Agentic AI for Low-Altitude Semantic Wireless Networks: An Energy Efficient Design

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This letter addresses the energy efficiency issue in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted autonomous systems. We propose a framework for an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-powered low-altitude semantic wireless network, that intelligently orchestrates a sense-communicate-decide-control workflow. A system-wide energy consumption minimization problem is formulated to enhance mission endurance. This problem holistically optimizes key operational variables, including UAV's location, semantic compression ratio, transmit power of the UAV and a mobile base station, and binary decision for AI inference task offloading, under stringent latency and quality-of-service constraints. To tackle the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm which can obtain the globally optimal solution with two-dimensional search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed design, demonstrating significant reductions in total energy consumption compared to conventional baseline approaches.

Moreover, we use these one-dimensional methods and examples to understand the approximation numbers of differences of composition operators acting on the space H 2 (D 2 ) of the bidisc.

On The Cutoff Phenomenon For Dyson-Laguerre Processes
Samuel Chan-Ashing (CEREMADE, CMAP)
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We study the convergence to equilibrium in high dimensions, focusing on explicit bounds on mixing times and the emergence of the cutoff phenomenon for Dyson-Laguerre processes. These are interacting particle systems with non-constant diffusion coefficients, arising naturally in the context of sample covariance matrices. The infinitesimal generator of the process admits generalized Laguerre orthogonal polynomials as eigenfunctions.
Our analysis relies on several distances and divergences, including an intrinsic Wasserstein distance adapted to the non-Euclidean geometry of the process. Within this framework, we employ tools from Riemannian geometry and functional inequalities. In particular, we establish exponential decay and derive a regularization inequality for the intrinsic Wasserstein distance via comparison with relative entropy.

Exact Limsup Growth of Rarely Visited Sites for One-Dimensional Simple Random Walk

Comments:

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We investigate the minimal local time $f(n)$ of a one-dimensional simple random walk up to time $n$, defined as the smallest number of visits to any site in the range. A conjecture formulated repeatedly by Erdős and Révész (1987, 1991) stated that $\limsup_{n\to\infty}f(n)=2$ almost surely, which was disproved by Tóth (1996) who showed $\limsup_{n\to\infty}f(n)=\infty$. Subsequently, Révész (2013) suggested studying the growth rate and established an upper bound of the order $\log n$.
In this paper, we determine the precise asymptotic growth rate, proving that with probability one, $$ \limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{f(n)}{\log\log n}=\frac{1}{\log 2}. $$ This result answers the open question posed in Section 13.2 of Révész (2013).

This paper investigates a minimal time control problem for the heat equation with multiple impulse controls. We first establish the maximum principles for this problem and then prove the equivalence between the minimal time impulse control problem and its corresponding minimal norm impulse control problem. Extending our analysis to the minimal time function itself, we examine its analytical properties (particularly continuity and monotonicity) with respect to the control constraint. This leads to a notable discovery: despite being continuous and generally monotonic, the function may fail to be strictly decreasing.

Monodromy and rigidity of crystalline local systems

We study several rigidity properties of $p$-adic local systems on a smooth rigid analytic space $X$ over a $p$-adic field. We prove that the monodromy of the log isocrystal attached to a $p$-adic local system is ''rigid'' along irreducible components of the special fiber. Then we give several applications. First, suppose that $X$ has good reduction. We show that if a family of semistable representations is crystalline at one classical point on $X$, then it is crystalline everywhere. Second, combining with the $p$-adic monodromy theorem recently studied by the authors and their collaborators, we prove the following surprising rigidity result conjectured by Shankar: for any $p$-adic local system on a smooth projective variety with good reduction, if it is potentially crystalline at one classical point, then it is potentially crystalline everywhere. Finally, we show that if a $p$-adic local system on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor on a smooth rigid analytic space is crystalline at all classical points, then it extends uniquely to a $p$-adic local system on the entire space. In other words, such a local system cannot have geometric monodromy if it has no arithmetic monodromy everywhere on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor.

As well-known, inner functions play an important role in the study of bounded analytic function theory. In recent years, persistence module theory, as a main tool applied to Topological Data Analysis, has received widespread attention. In this paper, we aim to use persistence module theory to study inner functions. We introduce the persistence modules arised from the level sets of inner functions. Some properties of these persistence modules are shown. In particular, we prove that the persistence modules (potentially not of locally finite type) induced by a class of inner functions have interval module decompositions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interleaving distance of the persistence modules is continuous with respect to the supremum norm for a class of Blaschke products, which could be used to discuss the path-connectedness of Blaschke products. As an example, we provide an explicit formula for the interleaving distance of the persistence modules induced by the Blaschke products with order two.

On the asymptotic profile of solutions to semilinear damped wave equations with critical nonlinearities

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for a semilinear damped wave equation with the nonlinear term $|u|^{1+2/n} \mu(|u|)$, where $\mu$ is a modulus of continuity. In recent papers by Ebert,Girardi,Reissig (Math. Ann. 378 (2020)) and Girardi (Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 32 (2025)), the authors obtained a sharp critical condition on $\mu$ in low space dimensions $n=1,2,3$, which determines the threshold between global (in time) existence of small data solutions and blow-up of solutions in finite time. Our new results are to prove that this condition remains valid in dimension $n=4$, together with the asymptotic profiles of global solutions. From this, we see that the behavior of the solution at $t \to \infty$ is identified by the Gauss kernel. Finally, a sharp lifespan estimate for local solutions is also derived in the case when blow-up occurs.

Parameter Estimation for Jump-Diffusion Stochastic Master Equations

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Probability (math.PR); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
This paper investigates parameter estimation for open quantum systems under continuous observation, whose conditional dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion stochastic master equations (SMEs) associated with quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements. Estimation of model parameters such as coupling strengths or measurement efficiencies is essential, yet in practice these parameters are often uncertain. We first establish the existence and well-posedness of a reduced quantum filter: for an N-level system, the conditional evolution can be represented in an O(N)-dimensional real state space rather than the full O(N^2) density-matrix state space. Building on this, we extend the stability theory of quantum filters, showing that exponential convergence persists not only under mismatched initial states but also in the presence of parameter mismatch. Finally, we develop an estimation framework for continuous parameter domains and prove almost sure consistency of the estimator in the long-time limit. These results yield a rigorous treatment of parameter estimation for jump-diffusion SMEs, combining structural reduction with stability and identifiability analysis, and thereby extend the mathematical theory of parameter estimation for open quantum systems.

This work introduces a universal framework for analyzing coupled random matrix models, centered around the newly defined Dyson Trace Flow and the Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law. We derive stochastic differential equations for eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling, establish well-posedness, and prove a large deviation principle with explicit rate functions. The theory is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing phenomena such as exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries is established, connecting to quantum chaos. These results generalize classical random matrix theory to interacting systems, with applications in neural networks and quantum dynamics.

Intersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton Polygon Stratifications of $\mathcal{A}_{5}$

Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)
The moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarised abelian varieties of dimension $g$, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p >0$, is studied through various stratifications. The two most prominent ones are the Newton polygon stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group of an abelian variety, and the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, defined by the isomorphism class of its $p$-torsion group scheme. In general, it is not known how the strata of these two intersect. In this paper we study intersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton polygon stratification in dimension at most $5$. We give an explicit description of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification of the supersingular locus $\mathcal{S}_{5}$, and describe other $p$-rank zero intersections of the two stratifications. For intersections of positive $p$-rank, we describe all such intersections in dimensions at most $5$. Our proofs use Oort's minimality of $p$-divisible groups, as well as related results of Chai-Oort and Harashita. In addition to these, a new approach used in this paper is an inductive argument, based on understanding the Ekedahl-Oort type of products of abelian varieties and the known intersections in lower dimensions.

The numerical radius of fractional powers of matrices

Using integral representations of the fractional power of matrices, and the geometric intuition of sectorial matrices, we show that for any accretive-dissipative matrix $A$ and any $t \in (0,1)$, the matrix \(A^t\) is accretive-dissipative, and that \[ \omega(A^t)\geq \omega^t(A) , \] where \(\omega(\cdot)\) is the numerical radius. This inequality complements the well-known power inequality $\omega(A^k)\leq \omega^k(A)$, valid for any square matrix and positive integer power $k$. As an application, we prove that if $A$ is accretive, then the above fractional inequality holds if $0<t<\frac{1}{2}$. Other consequences will be given too.

Sparse Regularization by Smooth Non-separable Non-convex Penalty Function Based on Ultra-discretization Formula

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Signal Processing (eess.SP)
In sparse optimization, the $\ell_{1}$ norm is widely adopted for its convexity, yet it often yields solutions with smaller magnitudes than expected. To mitigate this drawback, various non-convex sparse penalties have been proposed. Some employ non-separability, with ordered weighting as an effective example, to retain large components while suppressing small ones. Motivated by these approaches, we propose ULPENS, a non-convex, non-separable sparsity-inducing penalty function that enables control over the suppression of elements. Derived from the ultra-discretization formula, ULPENS can continuously interpolate between the $\ell_{1}$ norm and a non-convex selective suppressing function by adjusting parameters inherent to the formula. With the formula, ULPENS is smooth, allowing the use of efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. We establish key theoretical properties of ULPENS and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through numerical experiments.

We consider a class of integer-constrained optimization problems governed by partial differential equation (PDE) constraints and regularized via total variation (TV) in the context of topology optimization. The presence of discrete design variables, nonsmooth regularization, and non-convex objective renders the problem computationally challenging. To address this, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, which enables a decomposition of the original problem into simpler subproblems that can be solved efficiently. The augmented Lagrangian formulation ensures consistency across variable updates while facilitating convergence under appropriate conditions.

The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra.
In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras.
We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.

Lyndon Word Transduction to Improve the Efficiency of Computing Chen-Fliess Series
W. Steven Gray, Fatima Raza, Lance Berlin, Luis A. Duffaut Espinosa
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
The class of input-output systems representable as Chen-Fliess series arises often in control theory. One well known drawback of this representation, however, is that the iterated integrals which appear in these series are algebraically related by the shuffle product. This becomes relevant when one wants to numerically evaluate these series in applications, as this redundancy leads to unnecessary computational expense. The general goal of this paper is to present a computationally efficient way to evaluate these series by introducing what amounts to a change of basis for the computation. The key idea is to use the fact that the shuffle algebra on (proper) polynomials over a finite alphabet is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra generated by the Lyndon words over this alphabet. The iterated integrals indexed by Lyndon words contain all the input information needed to compute the output. The change of basis is accomplished by applying a transduction, that is, a linear map between formal power series in different alphabets, to re-index the Chen-Fliess series in terms of Lyndon monomials. The method is illustrated using a simulation of a continuously stirred-tank reactor system under a cyber-physical attack.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This survey collects, within a unified framework, various results (primarily by the authors themselves) on the use of Deterministic Infinite-Dimensional Optimal Control Theory to address applied economic models. The main aim is to illustrate, through several examples, the typical features of such models (including state constraints, non-Lipschitz data, and non-regularizing differential operators) and the corresponding methods needed to handle them. This necessitates developing aspects of the existing Deterministic Infinite-Dimensional Optimal Control Theory (see, e.g., the book by Li and Yong, 2012) in specific and often nontrivial directions. Given the breadth of this area, we emphasize the Dynamic Programming Approach and its application to problems where explicit or quasi-explicit solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations can be obtained. We also provide insights and references for cases where such explicit solutions are not available.

For various classes of graphical models it has been observed that the ratio of the partition sum to its Bethe approximation is often close to being the square of the ratio of the partition sum to its degree-2 Bethe approximation. This is of relevance because the latter ratio can often better be analyzed and/or quantified than the former ratio. In this paper, we give some justifications for the observed relationship between these two ratios and then analyze these ratios for two classes of log-supermodular graphical models.

We study the core of a proper action by a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$, extending the construction for $G$ compact by Skjelbred and Straume. Moreover, we show that many properties of a proper $G$-action on $M$ are determined by the action of a group $G'$ on the corresponding core $_cM$. We say that such properties admit a reduction principle. In particular, we prove that a proper isometric $G$-action on $M$ is polar (resp. hyperpolar) if and only if the $G'$-action on $_cM$ is polar (resp. hyperpolar). In the case of a proper action by syplectomorphisms on a symplectic manifold, we show that a reduction principle holds for coisotropic and infinitesimally almost homogeneous actions. We further study the coisotropic condition for the case of a proper Hamiltonian action and its relation with the symplectic stratification described by Lermann and Bates. In particular, we obtain several characterizations for coisotropic actions, some of which extend known results for the action of a compact group of holomorphic automorphisms on a compact Kähler manifold obtained by Huckleberry and Wurzbacher. Finally, we study some applications of the core construction for the action of a compact Lie group on a Kähler manifold by holomorphic isometries.

A twice continuously differentiable penalty function for nonlinear semidefinite programming problems and its application
Yuya Yamakawa
Comments:
17 pages
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper presents a twice continuously differentiable penalty function for nonlinear semidefinite programming problems. In some optimization methods, such as penalty methods and augmented Lagrangian methods, their convergence property can be ensured by incorporating a penalty function into them, and hence several types of penalty functions have been proposed. In particular, these functions are designed to apply optimization methods to find first-order stationary points. Meanwhile, in recent years, second-order sequential optimality, such as Approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker2 (AKKT2) and Complementarity AKKT2 (CAKKT2) conditions, has been introduced, and the development of methods for such second-order stationary points would be required in future research. However, existing well-known penalty functions have low compatibility with such methods because they are not twice continuously differentiable. In contrast, the proposed function is expected to have a high affinity for methods to find second-order stationary points. To verify the high affinity, we also present a practical penalty method to find points that satisfy the AKKT and CAKKT conditions by exploiting the proposed function and show their convergence properties.

We obtain tight bounds on Poisson tails which are easy to handle. A short proof based on the median of the gamma distribution is given. Numerical comparisons with other known estimates are made. As an application, we consider the rates of pointwise convergence for $S_nf(x)-f(x)$, as $n\rightarrow \infty$, where $S_n$ is the Szász-Mirakyan operator and $x$ belongs to an open interval $I$. If the function $f$ is affine on $I$, the rate of convergence is exponential. This property is no longer true at the boundary of $I$

Symplectic criteria for elliptic curves, revisited

Let $\ell$ and $p \geq 3$ be different primes. Let $E/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ and $E'/\mathbb{Q}_\ell$ be elliptic curves with isomorphic $p$-torsion. Assume that $E$ has potentially multiplicative reduction. We classify when all $G_{\mathbb{Q}_\ell}$-isomorphisms $\phi : E[p] \to E'[p]$ have the same symplectic type and prove two new criteria to determine the type in that case. In particular, when both curves have multiplicative reduction, our results cover the case of unramified $p$-torsion which is not covered by the original criterion due to Kraus and Oesterlé.
We also give a variant of a symplectic criterion for the case when both $E$ and~$E'$ have good reduction and provide an algorithm to apply it.
As an application, we determine the symplectic type of all the mod $p \geq 5$ congruences between rational elliptic curves with conductor $\leq 500 000$ that satisfy the hypothesis of either of our criteria at some prime~$\ell$.

There is no prime functional digraph: Seifert's proof revisited
Adrien Richard
Comments:
14 pages
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
A functional digraph is a finite digraph in which each vertex has a unique out-neighbor. Considered up to isomorphism and endowed with the directed sum and product, functional digraphs form a semigroup that has recently attracted significant attention, particularly regarding its multiplicative structure. In this context, a functional digraph $X$ divides a functional digraph $A$ if there exists a functional digraph $Y$ such that $XY$ is isomorphic to $A$. The digraph $X$ is said to be prime if it is not the identity for the product, and if, for all functional digraphs $A$ and $B$, the fact that $X$ divides $AB$ implies that $X$ divides $A$ or $B$. In 2020, Antonio E. Porreca asked whether prime functional digraphs exist, and in 2023, his work led him to conjecture that they do not. However, in 2024, Barbora Hudcová discovered that this result had already been proved by Ralph Seifert in 1971, in a somewhat forgotten paper. The terminology in that work differs significantly from that used in recent studies, the framework is more general, and the non-existence of prime functional digraphs appears only as a part of broader results, relying on (overly) technical lemmas developed within this general setting. The aim of this note is to present a much more accessible version of Seifert's proof $-$ that no prime functional digraph exists $-$ by using the current language and simplifying each step as much as possible.

Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Differential Geometry (math.DG)
We introduce the notion of Stäckel lift as a novel geometric setting for the construction of large classes of integrable Hamiltonian systems. The Stäckel lift extends the geometric framework underlying both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian-type classical Eisenhart lifts and is intimately related with Haantjes geometry. In particular, we establish that Hamiltonian systems constructed through Stäckel lifts are naturally endowed with a symplectic-Haantjes structure.
We also show that explicitly momentum-dependent lifting matrices produce systems interpretable as gravitational waves, or momentum-dependent metrics of Hamilton and Finsler geometries, with potential applications in modified gravity theories.

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
Bifoliated planes arise naturally in the study of Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. To any Anosov flow on a $3$-manifold $M$, one can associate a bifoliated plane equipped with an action of the fundamental group of $M$ which encodes the topology of the flow.
This thesis begins by showing left-orderability of any group acting faithfully on a bifoliated plane. We then describe the bifoliated planes associated with two families of Anosov flows which are constructed from algebraic and combinatorial data via gluing procedures. For one of these families, we show that all the resulting bifoliated planes are isomorphic. In contrast, for the other family, we show that the defining data can be recovered as a topological invariant of the bifoliated plane.

Voltage-sensitive distribution factors for contingency analysis and topology optimization

Topology optimization is a promising approach for mitigating congestion and managing changing grid conditions, but it is computationally challenging and requires approximations. Conventional distribution factors like PTDFs and LODFs, based on DC power flow, fail to capture voltage variations, reactive power, and losses - limiting their use in detailed optimization tasks such as busbar splitting. This paper introduces generalized distribution factors derived from a voltage-sensitive linearization of the full AC power flow equations. The proposed formulation accurately reflects reactive power flows, Ohmic losses, and voltage deviations while remaining computationally efficient. We derive and evaluate generalized PTDFs, LODFs, and topology modification factors using matrix identities. We discuss potential applications including voltage-aware N-1 security analysis, and topology optimization with a focus on busbar splitting. Numerical experiments demonstrate close agreement with full AC solutions, significantly outperforming the traditional DC approximation.

A fast direct solver for two-dimensional transmission problems of elastic waves
Yasuhiro Matsumoto, Taizo Maruyama
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper describes a fast direct boundary element method for elastodynamic transmission problems in two dimensions, which can be used for analyzing elastic wave scattering by an inclusion. This paper reports the development of an efficient solver based on a discretization method that is broadly applicable regardless of the inclusion shape. From the smoothness of the solutions of the Navier--Cauchy equation, it is reasonable that the displacement is approximated by the piecewise linear bases and the traction is approximated by the piecewise constant bases. However, in this mixed bases strategy, Calderón preconditioning, that is, an analytical preconditioning with excellent performance, cannot be applied, which means we cannot adopt iterative solvers. To address this challenge, we developed a fast direct solver formulated using both Burton--Miller and Poggio--Miller--Chang--Harrington--Wu--Tsai (PMCHWT) boundary integral equations. Our method uses a technique based on the proxy method for low-rank approximation of the coefficient matrix's off-diagonal blocks. To handle transmission problems, the proposed fast direct solver uses separate binary tree partitions for nodes and elements. Numerical examples demonstrate that our solver achieves linear computational complexity and can efficiently handle problems with multiple right-sides. Notably, the solver based on the Burton--Miller formulation is approximately 20\% faster than the one using the PMCHWT formulation. Our new method provides a versatile, fast solver, whose performance is independent of the shape of inclusions and computational parameters, such as frequency and density, for elastodynamic transmission problems.

Ricci Flow on Weighted Digraphs with Balancing Factor
Shuliang Bai, Rui Li, Shuang Liu, Xin Lai
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
Ricci curvature and Ricci flow have proven to be powerful tools for analyzing the geometry of discrete structures, particularly on undirected graphs, where they have been applied to tasks ranging from community detection to graph representation learning. However, their development on directed graphs remains limited, with Ricci flow being especially underexplored. In this work, we introduce a rigorous formulation of Ricci flow on directed weighted graphs, which evolves edge weights while preserving distances, and establish both the existence and uniqueness of its solutions. To capture the essence of asymmetry in directed networks and to enhance the capability of modeling more flexible structures, we incorporate a node-wise balancing factor that regulates between outflow and inflow. Building on the continuous Ricci flow evolution framework, we propose a discrete Ricci flow algorithm that is applicable to numerical computing. Numerical studies on various directed graph examples demonstrate the capacity of the proposed flow to reveal structural asymmetry and dynamic evolutions.

Modelling and Analysis of Non-Contacting Mechanical Face Seals with Axial Disturbances and Misalignment
Ben S Ashby, Tristan Pryer, Nicola Y Bailey

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Advancements in industrial applications are driving developments in non-contacting
mechanical seal technology. Key requirements include improvements in efficiency and
reliability, which lead to smaller clearances, lower frictional losses, and
minimisation of wear, during operation. However, a critical consideration is the
effect of external disturbances experience by the seal from the local environment
which may cause destabilisation, and lead to premature failures through unanticipated
face contact.
This work examines the dynamic behaviour of a non-contacting mechanical face seals,
where a thin fluid film separates a pair of coaxial discs; a rotor (rotating face) and
stator (stationary face). It is assumed that the rotor-stator have an angular
misalignment and operation is under conditions involving large axial disturbances,
representing external disturbances. A fully coupled unsteady mathematical
representation is developed, where the fluid flow is coupled to the structural
response of the stator, and the rotor motion is prescribed. The stator is modelled as
a spring-mass-damper system, and the fluid film model is based on a lubrication
approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations. The governing equations are solved via a
numerical technique based on finite element and Runge-Kutta methods.
A parameter study reveals the impact of misalignment on the seal dynamics, when
experiencing an external disturbance. The angle of misalignment and corresponding
amplitude of forcing can be identified when the minimum fluid film thickness becomes
less than a given tolerance. This provides insights into safe operating conditions and
manufacturing tolerances, with the research aiding to improve the design critera and
reliability of non-contacting mechanical face seals.

We also show that T-RAAGs are biautomatic, providing an alternative solution to the conjugacy problem.

Functional Analysis (math.FA)
Basis of a Banach space with respect to a filter F on N (F-basis for short) is a generalization of basis, where the ordinary convergence of series is substituted by convergence of partial sums with respect to the filter F. We study the behavior of the norms of partial sums operators for an F-basis, depending on the filter and on the space. One of the central results is:
The following properties of a sequence $(a_n)_{n \in N} \subset (1, \infty)$ are equivalent:
(i) $\sum_{n \in N} a_n^{-1} = \infty$.
(ii) There are a free filter F on N, an infinite-dimensional Banach space X and an F-basis $(u_k)$ of X such that the norms of the partial sums operators with respect of $(u_k)$ are equal to the corresponding $a_n$.

Exploring the potential resource integration under passenger-freight shared mobility: collaborative optimization of multi-type bus scheduling and dynamic vehicle capacity allocation for urban-rural bus routes
Jiabin Wu, Zijian Huang, Linhong Wang, Yiming Bie, Yuting Ji, Jun Gong
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Under the global background of developing urban-rural travel patterns, traditional urban-rural public transport systems are generally faced with the serious challenges of passenger loss and operating deficit, leading to a reduction in the bus frequency and service reliability. In order to break the vicious circle of demand decline-supply shrinkage, passenger-freight shared mobility (PFSM), an innovative operation mode, can achieve synergies between urban-rural logistics and public transport services by integrating public transit network resources and vehicle spare capacity. However, PFSM has changed the operating characteristics of urban-rural bus systems, posing some new challenges. To expand the relevant theory and find the solutions to those challenges, this study proposes an economy-efficiency-low-carbon -oriented resource reconfiguration strategy by formulating the collaborative bilevel optimization of multi-type bus scheduling and dynamic vehicle capacity allocation for urban-rural bus routes. The improved jellyfish search algorithm is developed to solve the premature convergence problem of the traditional algorithms in solving a high-dimensional hybrid discrete-continuous optimization. The results of a case of two urban-rural bus lines in Shanxi Province, China, indicate that the proposed scheme can improve operating revenue by 328.45% and reduce freight carbon emissions by 19.12 tons/year within the increase of 19.46% in average passenger travel time. The sensitivity analysis explicates key parameters selected for PFSM in terms of economic, efficiency and environmental dimensions. The proposed method provides some novel insights and solutions for the sustainable development of urban-rural public transport systems and the last kilometer problem of rural logistics, with significant values of both economic growth and environmental carbon reduction.

To conduct a didactic analysis of the current modality of study of real numbers in the Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics, we rely on the notion of didactic paradigm and employ a novel research methodology within the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic. This methodology proposes that, in general, analysing a modality of study of a field of knowledge, currently implemented in a certain didactic institution, consists of modelling, through respective didactic paradigms, not only the current modality of study but also: (1) an alternative modality of study (a possible future) whose didactic ends include attempting to avoid certain current phenomena considered ``undesirable'' from the perspective of research; and (2) an antecedent modality of study (a possible past) that allows us to explain the emergence of current phenomena as a reaction to the existence of certain antecedent phenomena.

Approximation Analysis of the Entropic Penalty in Quadratic Programming

Comments:
30 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Quadratic assignment problems are a fundamental class of combinatorial optimization problems which are ubiquitous in applications, yet their exact resolution is NP-hard. To circumvent this impasse, it was proposed to regularize such problems via an entropic penalty, leading to computationally tractable proxies. Indeed, this enabled efficient algorithms, notably in the context of Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problems, but it is unknown how well solutions of the regularized problem approximate those of the original one for small regularization parameters. Treating the broader framework of general quadratic programs (QPs), we establish that the approximation gap decays exponentially quickly for concave QPs, while the rate for general indefinite or convex QPs can be as slow as linear. Our analysis builds on the study of the entropic penalty in linear programming by leveraging a new representation for concave QPs, which connects them to a family of linear programs with varying costs. Building on these results, we design an algorithm which, given a local solution of the entropic QP, returns a candidate minimizer of the original QP and certifies it. We apply these findings to a general class of discrete GW problems, yielding new variational forms and the first exponentially vanishing entropic approximation bound in the GW literature.

We provide a comprehensive overview of meshfree collocation methods for numerically approximating differential operators on continuously labeled unstructured point clouds. Meshfree collocation methods do not require a computational grid or mesh. Instead, they approximate smooth functions and their derivatives at potentially irregularly distributed collocation points, often called particles, to a desired order of consistency. We review several meshfree collocation methods from the literature, trace the historical development of key concepts, and propose a classification of methods according to their principle of derivation. Although some of the methods reviewed are similar or identical, there are subtle yet important differences between many, which we highlight and discuss. We present a unifying formulation of meshfree collocation methods that renders these differences apparent and show how each method can be derived from this formulation. Finally, we propose a generalized derivation for meshfree collocation methods going forward.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Metric Geometry (math.MG)
The number of faces of the convex hull of $n$ independent and identically distributed random points chosen on the boundary of a smooth convex body in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is investigated. In dimensions two and three the number of $k$-faces is known to be constant almost surely and in dimension four and higher the variance is known to be non-zero if $k\ge 1$. We show that it is of order $n$. This is complemented by a central limit theorem with a Berry-Esseen bound which is of optimal order $n^{-1/2}$. We derive similar results for the Poissonized model, where additionally the number of random points is Poisson distributed. As a main tool, we develop a representation of the number of faces as a sum of exponentially stabilizing score functions.

Development of a Model Order Reduced Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (MORALE) formulation for structures subjected to dynamic moving loads

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In recent developments, it has been demonstrated that the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation can be utilized to improve computational efficiency, when simulating the response of structures subjected to moving loads. It is also well established in literature, that Model Order Reduction (MOR) techniques significantly enhance calculation speed. This contribution details the combination of both these tools into a novel Model Order Reduced Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (MORALE) formulation. Both hyperelastic and viscoelastic material models are considered. Simulations of pavement structures subjected to moving loads are then carried out, which show a significant enhancement in computational speed and efficiency. Such an efficient and fast simulation framework is of vital importance in technologies such as digital twins of roadway infrastructure (like pavements), as it enables engineers to quickly run what-if analyses and make informed decisions about the management of the structure under consideration.

This paper studies wall crossings in Bridgeland stability for the moduli space of Pandharipande--Thomas stable pairs associated with quintic genus 2 curves in the complex projective three-space. We provide a complete list of irreducible components of the moduli space, together with a birational description of each component. As an application, we recover the geometry of the Hilbert scheme for quintic genus 2 curves, for which no previous results are known.

Constrained Higher-Order Binary Optimization for Wireless Communications Systems Using Ising Machines

Comments:

Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
This paper develops an algorithmic solution using Ising machines to solve large-scale higher-order binary optimization (HOBO) problems with inequality constraints for resource optimization in wireless communications systems. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) aims to solve a special category of these problems widely encountered in engineering and science. To solve QUBO instances, specialized Ising machines have been designed, while sophisticated quantum annealing algorithm and quantum-inspired classical heuristics have been developed. However, the application of QUBO in wireless communications has limited practical interest mainly due to the complexity of resource optimization problems which are often characterized by high-order polynomial terms and strict inequality constraints. To overcome these bottlenecks and take advantage of recent advancements in Ising machines, in this paper, we propose an iterative algorithmic solution to solve HOBO problems, which is based on the augmented Lagrangian method to handle constraints. Specifically, Taylor expansion is employed to approximate higher-order polynomials to quadratic ones in the augmented Lagrangian function, which enables the solution of a single QUBO problem at each iteration without auxiliary variables. As an illustrative case study, we consider the problem of phase optimization in a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system, where a reconfigurable intelligent surface with 1-bit phase resolution is used to facilitate information/energy transfer. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory performance and outperforms heuristic benchmark schemes.

Efficient Long-Time Simulations of Multiscale Systems via High-Order Numerical Homogenization
Bojin Chen, Zeyu Jin, Ruo Li
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
By a high-order numerical homogenization method, a heterogeneous multiscale scheme was developed in Jin & Li (2022) for evolving differential equations containing two time scales. In this paper, we further explore the technique to propose an efficient algorithm able to carry out simulations up to a long time which was prohibitive before. The new algorithm is a multigrid-in-time method which combines coarse-grid high-order approximations with fine-grid low-order evaluations. The high efficiency is attained by minimizing the computational cost while the approximation accuracy is guaranteed. A priori error estimates are rigorously established and validated by numerical examples.

A convergent finite element method for two-phase Stokes flow driven by surface tension
Genming Bai, Harald Garcke, Shravan Veerapaneni
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present the first convergence proof for an iso-parametric finite element discretization of two-phase Stokes flow in $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$, with interface dynamics governed by mean curvature. The proof relies on a crucial discrete coupled parabolicity structure of the error system and a powerful iso-parametric framework of convergence analysis where we do not really discriminate consistency and stability. This new mixing idea leads to a non-trivial construction of the bulk mesh in the consistency analysis. The techniques and analysis developed in this paper provide fundamental numerical analysis tools for general curvature-driven free boundary problems.

Automorphism groups of Boolean powers with ample generics

Let $A$ be a finite non-abelian simple Mal'cev algebra, such as for example a finite simple non-abelian group or a finite simple non-zero ring. We show that the automorphism group of a filtered Boolean power of $A$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $A$ has ample generics. This uses the decomposition of that automorphism group as a semidirect product of a certain closure of a Boolean power of the automorphism group of $A$ by $B$ and the stabiliser of finitely many points in the homeomorphism group Homeo$2^\omega$ of the Cantor space $2^\omega$ by the authors. As an intermediate step, we show that pointwise stabilisers in Homeo$2^\omega$ have ample generics, which extends the result of Kwiatkowska that Homeo$2^\omega$ has ample generics.

Unifying HJB and Riccati equations: A Koopman operator approach to nonlinear optimal control
Tobias Breiten, Bernhard Höveler
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper proposes an operator-theoretic framework that recasts the minimal value function of a nonlinear optimal control problem as an abstract bilinear form on a suitable function space. The resulting bilinear form is shown to satisfy an operator equation with quadratic nonlinearity obtained by formulating the Lyapunov equation for a Koopman lift of the optimal closed-loop dynamics to an infinite-dimensional state space. It is proven that the minimal value function admits a rapidly convergent sum-of-squares expansion, a direct consequence of the fast spectral decay of the bilinear form. The framework thereby establishes a natural link between the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and a Riccati-like operator equation and further motivates numerical low-rank schemes.

The Euler class of the normal bundle of a Seifert fibration and horizontal foliations

Geometric Topology (math.GT)
For Seifert fibred manifolds with orientable base orbifolds, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the Euler class of the normal bundle of the Seifert fibration to vanish. When the base orbifold is hyperbolic, we also provide a second proof of this condition from the perspective of discrete faithful representations of Fuchsian groups.
As an application, we present infinitely many Seifert fibred rational homology spheres that admit co-oriented taut foliations but none with vanishing Euler class. In the context of the $L$-space conjecture, these provide examples of rational homology spheres that admit co-oriented taut foliations (and hence are not $L$-spaces) and have left-orderable fundamental groups yet none of the left-orders arise directly from the universal circle actions associated to co-oriented taut foliations.

Quasi-projective dimension was introduced by Gheibi, Jorgensen and Takahashi to generalize the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula and the depth formula in commutative algebra. In this paper, we establish some basic properties of quasi-projective dimensions of objects in abelian categories. Analogous to global dimension of rings, we also introduce the concept of quasi-global dimension for left Noetherian rings, and then compare quasi-global dimension with global dimension for a class of Nakayama algebras. This provides new examples of finite-dimensional algebras with finite quasi-global dimensions but infinite global dimensions.

Subjects:

Let $L/K$ be a cyclic extension of number fields, and let $S$ be a finite set of places of $K$ containing the ramified and Archimedean ones. We say that $L/K$ has the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property if, for any generator $\sigma \in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$, the kernel of the arithmetic norm map $\mathrm{cl}^S(L)\rightarrow \mathrm{cl}^S(K)$ coincides with $(1-\sigma)\mathrm{cl}^S(L)$.
We establish an effective criterion for the $\mathbf{cl}^S$-Hilbert 90 property and investigate its connections with Iwasawa theory, in particular its relation to the Gross--Kuz'min conjecture. This yields a new method for verifying the property by explicit computation, with further links to the theory of spins of prime ideals. We conjecture that in the totally real case the property fails for at most finitely many primes, and we present numerical evidence supporting a heuristic toward this conjecture.

Leaf it to renewal: Improved predictive maintenance policies via renewal theory and decision trees
Daniel Koutas, Daniel Straub
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We propose a general method for deriving prognostics-based predictive maintenance policies. The method takes into account the available decision options at hand, the information on the future state of the system provided by a prognostic model, as well as the costs of the underlying renewal-reward process. It results in heuristic policies with only a few parameters, which can be determined based on theoretical considerations or by optimization from run-to-failure data. We show the potential of the method on two separate predictive maintenance decision settings, namely preventive replacement and preventive ordering. Numerical investigations show that the derived heuristic policies achieve significantly lower cost ratios than other benchmark heuristic policies, while at the same time being more robust against overfitting.

This provides a partial solution to the characterization problem of rank 3 self-loop graphs.

We study the propagation of solitary waves in a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) lattice with small random heterogeneity in the linear spring force. Perturbed by the random environment, solitary waves lose energy through a radiative tail, resulting in gradual amplitude attenuation. As long as the wave remains coherent, we track its position and amplitude via a modulation approach. An expansion of the resulting modulation equations provides explicit predictions for the slow average amplitude decay, which we verify through numerical simulations.

Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres
Daniil Kucher

9 pages
Subjects:
Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Complex Variables (math.CV)
We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By utilizing Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.

The universal Harish-Chandra $j$-function

Let $F$ be a nonarchimedean local field with residue field of cardinality $q$, let $G$ be the $F$-points of a connected reductive group defined over $F$, let $P$ and $Q$ be two parabolic subgroups with the same Levi factor $M$. We construct intertwining operators $J_{Q|P}$ and the Harish-Chandra $j$-function $j^G$ for finitely generated smooth $A[M]$-modules, where $A$ is any commutative Noetherian algebra over $\mathbb{Z}' :=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$. The construction is functorial, compatible with extension of scalars, and generalizes the previously known constructions. We prove a generic Schur's lemma result for parabolic induction, which circumvents the need for generic irreducibility in defining $j^G$. Setting $A=\mathbb{Z}'$ and applying the construction to finitely generated projective generators produces a universal $j$-function that is a rational function with coefficients in the Bernstein center of $M$ over $\mathbb{Z}'$, and which gives the $j$-function of any object via specializing at points of the Bernstein scheme. We conclude by characterizing the local Langlands in families morphism (when it exists) for quasisplit classical groups in terms of an equality of $j$-functions.

We investigate the convergence of signed null sequences of the form \[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \varepsilon_n a_n, \quad \varepsilon_n \in \{-1,1\}, \] where $(a_n)$ tends to zero in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main result shows that for any such sequence, the set of sign sequences yielding convergence has full Hausdorff dimension in the natural ultrametric topology. This answers a question of Mattila in the one-dimensional case, for which we provide an elementary proof. Moreover, if $(a_n)\notin \ell^1$ in one dimension, then for every $L\in\mathbb{R}$ the set of sign sequences with sum $L$ also has Hausdorff dimension $1$. In higher dimensions the analogous statement does not hold in full generality, but it is guaranteed if the sequence has $d$ linearly independent Lévy vectors.

A heuristic for ray class groups of quadratic number fields

Subjects:

We formulate a model for the average behaviour of ray class groups of real quadratic fields with respect to a fixed rational modulus, locally at a finite set $S$ of odd primes. To that end, we introduce Arakelov ray class groups of a number field, and postulate that, locally at $S$, the Arakelov ray class groups of real quadratic fields are distributed randomly with respect to a natural Cohen--Lenstra type probability measure. We show that our heuristics imply the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics on class groups of real quadratic fields, as well as equidistribution results on the fundamental unit of a real quadratic field modulo an integer, and are consistent with Varma's results on average of sizes of $3$-torsion subgroups of ray class groups of quardratic fields.

For that, we use a quaternionic logarithm, as Singhof did in the complex case for the determination of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the unitary group.
Our result generalizes the known case $n=2$ (by L. Fernández-Suárez, A. Gómez-Tato and D. Tanré) and has to be compared to the equality $\mathrm{cat}\,Q_{3}=3$, established by N. Iwase and T. Miyauchi.

The partition function of each member of the family depends on the set of eigenvalues of monodromies of corner matrices around the vertices of the dual graph $\Gamma^*$ and sets of parameters attached to each vertex of $\Gamma$. We select the cases where the partition function of a model is a tau function of KP, 2KP and BKP hiearachies. We compare integrals over ${U}(N)$ and over ${SU}(N)$ groups. In $U(N)$ case there is no restriction on the number of vertices of $\Gamma$.

Algebraic Topology (math.AT); Spectral Theory (math.SP)
Laplacian operators are classical objects that are fundamental in both pure and applied mathematics and are becoming increasingly prominent in modern computational and data science fields such as applied and computational topology and application areas such as machine learning and network science. In this paper, we introduce a unifying operator-theoretic framework of generalized Laplacians as invariants that encompasses and extends all existing constructions, from discrete combinatorial settings to de Rham complexes of smooth manifolds. Within this framework, we introduce and study a generalized notion of persistent Laplacians. While the classical persistent Laplacian fails to satisfy the desirable properties of monotonicity and stability -- both crucial for robustness and interpretability -- our framework allows us to isolate and analyze these properties systematically. We demonstrate that their component maps, the up- and down-persistent Laplacians, satisfy these properties individually. Moreover, we prove that the spectra of these separate components fully determine the spectra of the full Laplacians, making them not only preferable but sufficient for analysis. We study these questions comprehensively, in both the finite and infinite dimensional settings. Our work expands and strengthens the theoretical foundation of generalized Laplacian-based methods in pure, applied, and computational mathematics.

Measuring Partial Exchangeability with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
Marta Catalano, Hugo Lavenant, Francesco Mascari
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Probability (math.PR)
In Bayesian multilevel models, the data are structured in interconnected groups, and their posteriors borrow information from one another due to prior dependence between latent parameters. However, little is known about the behaviour of the dependence a posteriori. In this work, we develop a general framework for measuring partial exchangeability for parametric and nonparametric models, both a priori and a posteriori. We define an index that detects exchangeability for common models, is invariant by reparametrization, can be estimated through samples, and, crucially, is well-suited for posteriors. We achieve these properties through the use of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, which map any random probability to a random object on a Hilbert space. This leads to many convenient properties and tractable expressions, especially a priori and under mixing. We apply our general framework to i) investigate the dependence a posteriori for the hierarchical Dirichlet process, retrieving a parametric convergence rate under very mild assumptions on the data; ii) eliciting the dependence structure of a parametric model for a principled comparison with a nonparametric alternative.

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
Graph-structured data is central to many scientific and industrial domains, where the goal is often to optimize objectives defined over graph structures. Given the combinatorial complexity of graph spaces, such optimization problems are typically addressed using heuristic methods, and it remains unclear how to systematically incorporate structural constraints to effectively reduce the search space. This paper introduces explicit optimization formulations for graph search space that encode properties such as reachability and shortest paths. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating the correctness and completeness of our graph encoding. To address the symmetry issues arising from graph isomorphism, we propose lexicographic constraints over neighborhoods to eliminate symmetries and theoretically prove that adding those constraints will not reduce the original graph space. Our graph encoding, along with the corresponding symmetry-breaking constraints, forms the basis for downstream optimization tasks over graph spaces.

Indirect Statistical Inference with Guaranteed Necessity and Sufficiency
Z Zhang, X Hu, C Lu, T Liu
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
This paper develops a new framework for indirect statistical inference with guaranteed necessity and sufficiency, applicable to continuous random variables. We prove that when comparing exponentially transformed order statistics from an assumed distribution with those from simulated unit exponential samples, the ranked quotients exhibit distinct asymptotics: the left segment converges to a non-degenerate distribution, while the middle and right segments degenerate to one. This yields a necessary and sufficient condition in probability for two sequences of continuous random variables to follow the same distribution. Building on this, we propose an optimization criterion based on relative errors between ordered samples. The criterion achieves its minimum if and only if the assumed and true distributions coincide, providing a second necessary and sufficient condition in optimization. These dual NS properties, rare in the literature, establish a fundamentally stronger inference framework than existing methods. Unlike classical approaches based on absolute errors (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov), NSE exploits relative errors to ensure faster convergence, requires only mild approximability of the cumulative distribution function, and provides both point and interval estimates. Simulations and real-data applications confirm NSE's superior performance in preserving distributional assumptions where traditional methods fail.

Rational and isolated quadratic points on hyperelliptic curves of rank 0 and small genus

In this article, we present a method for computing rational points on hyperelliptic curves of genus~3 and isolated quadratic points on hyperelliptic curves of genus~2 and~3 whose Jacobians have rank~0. Our approach begins by computing the image of the Mordell--Weil group on the associated Kummer variety and then determining which of these points correspond to rational or isolated quadratic points on the curve. We have developed and implemented this algorithm using the computer algebra system \texttt{\texttt{Magma}}. The method takes advantage of structural properties specific to hyperelliptic curves and their Jacobians. We applied our algorithm to a large dataset, analyzing 7,396 genus~3 hyperelliptic curves and 12,075 genus~2 hyperelliptic curves.

We first prove the conjecture for the family of Lawrence oriented matroids (LOMs) with even rank $r=2k+2$ and also for low ranks by computer. Next, we provide a general upper bound for the number of $k$-neighborly reorientations of any LOM. Finally, we prove that for any $k\ge 1$ and any oriented matroid on $n$ elements, $k$-Roudneff's conjecture holds asymptotically as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and thus giving more credit to the conjecture.

Given positive integers $h, N$ satisfying $1 \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$, we define $T(h,N)$ to be the number of $2\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant equal to $h$ whose entries lie in $[-N,N]$. Our first result states that for any $\varepsilon >0$, one has \[ T(h,N) = \frac{16}{\zeta(2)} N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon} (N+ h)).\] This quantitatively improves upon recent work of Afifurrahman and Ganguly--Guria. We further show that when $N^{1 + \delta} \leqslant h \leqslant 2N^2$ for any fixed $\delta>0$, the error term above is of roughly the right order. Our second result delivers an asymptotic formula for $T(h,N)$ with square-root cancellation whenever $h = N^2 + O(N)$. This error term is much stronger than its corresponding analogue in the smoothened version of this problem. More generally, for any $\varepsilon >0$ and any $N,h \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1\leq h \leq 2N^2$, we prove that \[ T(h,N) = \bigg( \frac{8}{\zeta(2)} - 4 \bigg)N^2 \bigg( \sum_{d |h} \frac{1}{d} \bigg) + O_{\varepsilon}(N^{\varepsilon}(N+ |h-N^2|)). \]

We investigate different notions of "computable topological base" for represented spaces. We show that several non-equivalent notions of bases become equivalent when we consider computably enumerable bases. This indicates the existence of a robust notion of computably second countable represented space. These spaces are precisely those introduced by Grubba and Weihrauch under the name "computable topological spaces". The present work thus clarifies the articulation between Schröder's approach to computable topology based on the Sierpinski representation and other approaches based on notions of computable bases. These other approaches turn out to be compatible with the Sierpinski representation approach, but also strictly less general. We revisit Schröder's Effective Metrization Theorem, by showing that it characterizes those represented spaces that embed into computable metric spaces: those are the computably second countable strongly computably regular represented spaces. Finally, we study different forms of open choice problems. We show that having a computable open choice is equivalent to being computably separable, but that the "non-total open choice problem", i.e., open choice restricted to open sets that have non-empty complement, interacts with effective second countability in a satisfying way.

Turing instability and 2-D pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems derived from kinetic theory
Stefano Boccelli, Giorgio Martalò, Romina Travaglini
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We investigate Turing instability and pattern formation in two-dimensional domains for two reaction-diffusion models, obtained as diffusive limits of kinetic equations for mixtures of monatomic and polyatomic gases. The first model is of Brusselator type, which, compared with the classical formulation, presents an additional parameter whose role in stability and pattern formation is discussed. In the second framework, the system exhibits standard nonlinear diffusion terms typical of predator-prey models, but differs in reactive terms. In both cases, the kinetic-based approach proves effective in relating macroscopic parameters, often set empirically, to microscopic interaction mechanisms, thereby rigorously identifying admissible parameter ranges for the physical description. Furthermore, weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulations extend previously known one-dimensional results and reveal a wider scenario of spatial structures, including spots, stripes, and hexagonal arrays, that better reflect the richness observed in real-world systems.

We study semiorders induced by points drawn from a uniform random distribution. Of particular interest in this paper are the probabilities of generating specific semiorders and the equivalence classes they produce. We present a method for calculating the asymptotic probability of inducing these semiorders and describe the qualities which group these semiorders together. We also find a class of semiorders, called \emph{ladders}, whose probabilities can be calculated using the Up/Down numbers.

On Brinkman flows with curvature-induced phase separation in binary mixtures

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
The mathematical analysis of diffuse-interface models for multiphase flows has attracted significant attention due to their ability to capture complex interfacial dynamics, including curvature effects, within a unified, energetically consistent framework. In this work, we study a novel Brinkman-Cahn-Hilliard system, coupling a sixth-order phase-field evolution with a Brinkman-type momentum equation featuring variable shear viscosity. The Cahn-Hilliard equation includes a nonconservative source term accounting for mass exchange, and the velocity equation contains a non divergence-free forcing term. We establish the existence of weak solutions in a divergence-free variational framework, and, in the case of constant mobility and shear viscosity, prove uniqueness and continuous dependence on the forcing. Additionally, we analyze the Darcy limit, providing existence results for the corresponding reduced system.

Applications of the L-space satellite formula

Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT)
We give a formula for the $\tau$-invariant of a satellite knot $P(K,n)$ when $P$ is an L-space satellite operator. Our formula holds for general L-space satellite operators $P$ when the companion $K$ satisfies $\epsilon(K)=1$. When $\epsilon(K)$ is $0$ or $-1$, we state a formula which requires some additional assumptions on $P$ or $n$. Our main tool is our algorithm which computes the knot Floer complex of satellite knots constructed using L-space satellite operators, which we developed in a previous paper. Our formula for $\tau$ recovers many existing formulas for the behavior of $\tau$ under satellite operators, including for cables. We apply our formula to questions about the slice genus of satellite knots, showing, e.g., that if $K$ is a knot with $\tau(K)=g_4(K)>0$, then satellites of $K$ by L-space satellite operators have the same property. Another application is a proof that L-space satellite operators satisfy a conjecture of Hedden and Pinzón-Caicedo: If $P$ is an L-space satellite operator which acts as a group homomorphism on the smooth concordance group, then $P$ is either the zero operator, the identity operator, or the orientation reversing operator.

Let $X(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be a Banach function space and $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ be a measurable set of positive measure. For a Fourier mutliplier $a$ on $X(\mathbb{R}^n)$, consider the Wiener-Hopf type operator $W_\Omega(a):=r_\Omega F^{-1}aF e_\Omega$, where $F^{\pm 1}$ are the Fourier transforms, $r_\Omega$ is the operator of restriction from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\Omega$ and $e_\Omega$ is the operator of extension by zero from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $X_2(\Omega)$ be the closure of $L^2(\Omega)\cap X(\Omega)$ in $X(\Omega)$. We show that if $X(\Omega)$ satisfies the so-called weak doubling property, then \[ \|a\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)} \le \|W_\Omega(a)\|_{\mathcal{B}(X_2(\Omega),X(\Omega))}. \] Further, we prove that if $X(\Omega)$ satisfies the so-called separated doubling property, then the Kuratowski measure of noncompactness of $W_\Omega(a)$ admits the following lower estimate: \[ \frac{1}{2}\|a\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)} \le \|W_\Omega(a)\|_{\mathcal{B}(X_2(\Omega),X(\Omega)),\kappa}. \] These results are specified to the case of variable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(C,w)$ with Muckenhoupt type weights $w$ over open cones $C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ with the vertex at the origin.

Modularity from $q$-series
Ken Ono
Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the community to provide a proof that takes the summatory forms of the Rogers--Ramanujan $q$-series as input and directly establishes their modularity. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be mysteriously modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for when holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|<1$ form a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.

Spectral theory of Schrödinger operators with potentials that are measures supported on ${\Bbb N}$
Oleg Safronov
Subjects:

We discuss spectral properties of the one-dimensional Schrödinger operator with a potential of the form $\sum V(n)\delta(x-n)$. Our main result says that the absolutely continuous spectum of such an operator covers an interval $[\alpha^2,\beta^2]$, if $V\in \ell^4$ and the Fourier series $\sum e^{2i kn}V(n)$ is a function of $k$ that is square integrable over $[\alpha,\beta]$. We prove that this result is sharp by constructing examples of potentials $V\notin\ell^2$ for which the spectrum of the Schrödinger operator is singular.

On the Poincaré-Einstein manifolds with cylindrical conformal infinity
Sun-Yung Alice Chang, Paul Yang, Ruobing Zhang
Subjects:
Differential Geometry (math.DG)
In this paper, we prove several rigidity and quantitative rigidity results for asymptotically hyperbolic Poincaré-Einstein manifolds whose conformal infinities are diffeomorphic to a cylinder $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$. It is a basic fact that the Riemannian product $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$ can bound, in addition to a complete hyperbolic metric on $S^1 \times D^n$, other Poincaré-Einstein metrics such as the AdS-Schwarzschild metrics on $D^2 \times S^{n - 1}$.
The main result shows that any Poincaré-Einstein filling of $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$ must be hyperbolic if it is non-positively curved. As corollaries, the Poincaré-Einstein filling of $S^1 \times S^{n - 1}$ is unique when the length of circle factor is sufficiently large or the $L^2$-energy of the Weyl curvature is sufficiently small relative to the Yamabe constant of the conformal infinity. To prove the Weyl pinching rigidity, we established a new $\epsilon$-regularity for the Weyl curvature of a general class of Poincaré-Einstein manifolds with conformal infinity of positive Yamabe type, which includes non-compact and volume-collapsed families of Poincaré-Einstein spaces in all dimensions.

We prove continuity for mappings $f \colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, in the Sobolev class $W^{1,n}_{\text{loc}}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ that satisfy the inequality \[
\lvert Df(x) \rvert^n \le K(x) \det Df(x) + \Sigma(x) \] whenever $K \in L^p_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ and $\Sigma \in L^q_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ with $p^{-1} + q^{-1} < 1$. This closes a significant gap between existing methods and known counterexamples. The result is sharp, new even in the planar case, and opens a systematic study of mappings with values of finite distortion in geometric function theory. As a key part of the proof, we introduce an overlooked Sobolev-type inequality based on measures of superlevel sets.

We study the operad structure on the homology of moduli spaces of pointed rooted trees of $d$-dimensional projective spaces, introduced by Chen, Gibney and Krashen a couple of decades ago. We describe this operad by generators and relations, show that it is homotopy Koszul, exhibit a Givental-type action on representations of that operad, and prove that this operad represents the homotopy quotient of the operad of chains of $S^1$-framed little $2d$-disks by its natural circle action. Our approach also sheds new light on the $d=1$ case, revealing a new combinatorial way to write the original Givental formulas.

The Fourth-Moment Theorem on Hilbert Spaces
Marie-Christine Düker, Pavlos Zoubouloglou
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
In a work by Bourguin and Campese [Electron. J. Probab. 25, 1-30 (2020)], a fourth-moment theorem for weak convergence to a Gaussian measure on separable Hilbert spaces was proposed. However, a very recent work by Bassetti, Bourguin, Campese, and Peccati [arXiv:2509.13427 (2025)] showed that the distance employed in the former article does not metrize weak convergence on such spaces; consequently, one of the main results therein does not hold as stated.
In this paper, we characterize convergence in distribution to a non-degenerate Gaussian measure on a separable Hilbert space for sequences of multiple Wiener-Itô integrals of fixed order. Assuming convergence of the associated covariance operators in the trace class norm, we prove that weak convergence holds if and only if the fourth weak moments converge to their Gaussian counterparts. A key tool in our approach is a Stein-Malliavin bound for a distance metrizing weak convergence on Hilbert spaces, hence extending the classical real-valued result of Nualart and Peccati [Ann. Probab. 33, 177-193 (2005)].

Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability. Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in test accuracy and energy efficiency.

Bandwidth of Gamma-Distribution-Shaped Functions via Lambert W Function
Anthony LoPrete, Johannes Burge
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Probability (math.PR)
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) is a useful quantity for characterizing the bandwidth of unimodal functions. However, a closed-form expression for the FWHM of gamma-shaped functions-i.e. functions that are shaped like the gamma distribution probability density function (PDF)-is not widely available. Here, we derive and present just such an expression. To do so, we use the Lambert W function to compute the inverse of the gamma PDF. We use this inverse to derive an exact analytic expression for the width of a gamma distribution at an arbitrary proportion of the maximum, from which the FWHM follows trivially. (An expression for the octave bandwidth of gamma-shaped functions is also provided.) The FWHM is then compared to the Gaussian approximation of gamma-shaped functions. A few other related issues are discussed.

A Novel Two-Dimensional Wigner Distribution Framework via the Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform with a Non-Separable Kernel

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT); Functional Analysis (math.FA)
This paper introduces a novel time-frequency distribution, referred to as the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Wigner Distribution (2D-NSQPWD), formulated within the framework of the Two-Dimensional Non-Separable Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform (2D-NSQPFT). By replacing the classical Fourier kernel with the NSQPFT kernel, the proposed distribution generalizes the classical Wigner distribution and effectively captures complex, non-separable signal structures. We rigorously establish several key properties of the 2D-NSQPWD, including time and frequency shift invariance, marginal behavior, conjugate symmetry, convolution relations, and Moyal's identity. Furthermore, the connection between the 2D-NSQPWD and the two-dimensional short-time Fourier transform (2D-STFT) is explored. The distribution's effectiveness is demonstrated through its application to single-, bi-, and tri-component two-dimensional linear frequency modulated (2D-LFM) signals, where it shows superior performance in cross-term suppression and signal localization.

E2E Learning Massive MIMO for Multimodal Semantic Non-Orthogonal Transmission and Fusion
Minghui Wu, Zhen Gao
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.

With the emergence of fluid antenna (FA) in wireless communications, the capability to dynamically adjust port positions offers substantial benefits in spatial diversity and spectrum efficiency, which are particularly valuable for mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. Therefore, we propose an FA-assisted MEC offloading framework to minimize system delay. This framework faces two severe challenges, which are the complexity of channel estimation due to dynamic port configuration and the inherent non-convexity of the joint optimization problem. Firstly, we propose Information Bottleneck Metric-enhanced Channel Compressed Sensing (IBM-CCS), which advances FA channel estimation by integrating information relevance into the sensing process and capturing key features of FA channels effectively. Secondly, to address the non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problem in FA-assisted MEC systems, which includes FA port selection, beamforming, power control, and resource allocation, we propose a game theory-assisted Hierarchical Twin-Dueling Multi-agent Algorithm (HiTDMA) based offloading scheme, where the hierarchical structure effectively decouples and coordinates the optimization tasks between the user side and the base station side. Crucially, the game theory effectively reduces the dimensionality of power control variables, allowing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly reduces system delay and enhances offloading performance, outperforming benchmarks. Additionally, the IBM-CCS channel estimation demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness under varying port densities, contributing to efficient communication under imperfect CSI.

A Measurement Report Data-Driven Framework for Localized Statistical Channel Modeling

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.

Neural Network Based Framework for Passive Intermodulation Cancellation in MIMO Systems
Xiaolong Li, Zhi-qin John Xu, Peiting You, Yifei Zhu
Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG)
Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.

Impact of RHIs and ipSIC on Active RIS-NOMA Systems with Low-Precision ADCs

Subjects:
Signal Processing (eess.SP); Information Theory (cs.IT); Performance (cs.PF)
This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.

Particle Filtering for Non-Deterministic Electrocardiographic Imaging

Methodology (stat.ME); Probability (math.PR); Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an); Applications (stat.AP)
Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) aims to non-invasively reconstruct activation maps of the heart from temporal body surface potentials. While most existing approaches rely on inverse and optimization techniques that may yield satisfactory reconstructions, they typically provide a single deterministic solution, overlooking the inherent uncertainty of the problem stemming from its very ill-posed nature, the poor knowledge of biophysical features and the unavoidable presence of noise in the measurements. The Bayesian framework, which naturally incorporates uncertainty while also accounting for temporal correlations across time steps, can be used to address this limitation. In this work, we propose a low-dimensional representation of the activation sequence that enables the use of particle filtering, a Bayesian filtering method that does not rely on predefined assumptions regarding the shape of the posterior distribution, in contrast to approaches like the Kalman filter. This allows to produce not only activation maps but also probabilistic maps indicating the likelihood of activation at each point on the heart over time, as well as pseudo-probability maps reflecting the likelihood of a point being part of an earliest activation site. Additionally, we introduce a method to estimate the probability of the presence of a conduction lines of block on the heart surface. Combined with classical reconstruction techniques, this could help discriminate artificial from true lines of block in activation maps. We support our approach with a numerical study based on simulated data, demonstrating the potential of our method.

Analyzing Uncertainty Quantification in Statistical and Deep Learning Models for Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

Forecasting High Dimensional Time Series with Dynamic Dimension Reduction
Daniel Peña, Victor J. Yohai
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Many dimension reduction techniques have been developed for independent data, and most have also been extended to time series. However, these methods often fail to account for the dynamic dependencies both within and across series. In this work, we propose a general framework for forecasting high-dimensional time series that integrates dynamic dimension reduction with regularization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a simulated example and a forecasting application using an economic dataset. We show that several specific methods are encompassed within this framework, including Dynamic Principal Components and Reduced Rank Autoregressive Models. Furthermore, time-domain formulations of Dynamic Canonical Correlation and Dynamic Redundancy Analysis are introduced here for the first time as particular instances of the proposed methodology. All of these techniques are analyzed as special cases of a unified procedure, enabling a coherent derivation and interpretation across methods.

Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.

THINNs: Thermodynamically Informed Neural Networks
Javier Castro, Benjamin Gess
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems, we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established penalization strategies.

Robust Near-Optimal Nonlinear Target Enclosing Guidance
Abhinav Sinha, Rohit V. Nanavati
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Robotics (cs.RO); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper proposes a nonlinear optimal guidance law that enables a pursuer to enclose a target within arbitrary geometric patterns, which extends beyond conventional circular encirclement. The design operates using only relative state measurements and formulates a target enclosing guidance law in which the vehicle's lateral acceleration serves as the steering control, making it well-suited for aerial vehicles with turning constraints. Our approach generalizes and extends existing guidance strategies that are limited to target encirclement and provides a degree of optimality. At the same time, the exact information of the target's maneuver is unnecessary during the design. The guidance law is developed within the framework of a state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE), thereby providing a systematic way to handle nonlinear dynamics through a pseudo-linear representation to design locally optimal feedback guidance commands through state-dependent weighting matrices. While SDRE ensures near-optimal performance in the absence of strong disturbances, we further augment the design to incorporate an integral sliding mode manifold to compensate when disturbances push the system away from the nominal trajectory, and demonstrate that the design provides flexibility in the sense that the (possibly time-varying) stand-off curvature could also be treated as unknown. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence

We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.

A Note on Fine-Grained Quantum Reductions for Linear Algebraic Problems
Kyle Doney, Cameron Musco
Subjects:
Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We observe that any $T(n)$ time algorithm (quantum or classical) for several central linear algebraic problems, such as computing $\det(A)$, $tr(A^3)$, or $tr(A^{-1})$ for an $n \times n$ integer matrix $A$, yields a $O(T(n)) + \tilde O(n^2)$ time \textit{quantum algorithm} for $n \times n$ matrix-matrix multiplication. That is, on quantum computers, the complexity of these problems is essentially equivalent to that of matrix multiplication. Our results follow by first observing that the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm gives a direct quantum reduction from matrix multiplication to computing $tr(ABC)$ for $n \times n$ inputs $A,B,C$. We can then reduce $tr(ABC)$ to each of our problems of interest.
For the above problems, and many others in linear algebra, their fastest known algorithms require $\Theta(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega \approx 2.37$ is the current exponent of fast matrix multiplication. Our finding shows that any improvements beyond this barrier would lead to faster quantum algorithms for matrix multiplication. Our results complement existing reductions from matrix multiplication in algebraic circuits [BCS13], and reductions that work for standard classical algorithms, but are not tight -- i.e., which roughly show that an $O(n^{3-\delta})$ time algorithm for the problem yields an $O(n^{3-\delta/3})$ matrix multiplication algorithm [WW10].

Probing Non-Markovian Quantum Channels via Hilbert-Schmidt Speed and Fidelity Enhanced Teleportation Protocols

The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence, which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM) with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.

Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory: A Framework for Adaptive Control in Non-Convex Domains

Stochastic optimal control methods often struggle in complex non-convex landscapes, frequently becoming trapped in local optima due to their inability to learn from historical trajectory data. This paper introduces Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory, a unified mathematical framework that integrates historical experience into stochastic optimal control. Our approach dynamically constructs memory-based potential fields that identify and encode key topological features of the state space, enabling controllers to automatically learn from past experiences and adapt their optimization strategy. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that memory-augmented potential fields possess non-convex escape properties, asymptotic convergence characteristics, and computational efficiency. We implement this theoretical framework in a Memory-Augmented Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller that demonstrates significantly improved performance in challenging non-convex environments. The framework represents a generalizable approach to experience-based learning within control systems (especially robotic dynamics), enhancing their ability to navigate complex state spaces without requiring specialized domain knowledge or extensive offline training.

Formal Safety Verification and Refinement for Generative Motion Planners via Certified Local Stabilization

We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).

The advent of Scientific Machine Learning has heralded a transformative era in scientific discovery, driving progress across diverse domains. Central to this progress is uncovering scientific laws from experimental data through symbolic regression. However, existing approaches are dominated by heuristic algorithms or data-hungry black-box methods, which often demand low-noise settings and lack principled uncertainty quantification. Motivated by interpretable Statistical Artificial Intelligence, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for symbolic regression that represents scientific laws as ensembles of tree-structured symbolic expressions endowed with a regularized tree prior. This coherent probabilistic formulation enables full posterior inference via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, yielding a balance between predictive accuracy and structural parsimony. To guide symbolic model selection, we develop a marginal posterior-based criterion adhering to the Occam's window principle and further quantify structural fidelity to ground truth through a tailored expression-distance metric. On the theoretical front, we establish near-minimax rate of Bayesian posterior concentration, providing the first rigorous guarantee in context of symbolic regression. Empirical evaluation demonstrates robust performance of our proposed methodology against state-of-the-art competing modules on a simulated example, a suite of canonical Feynman equations, and single-atom catalysis dataset.

Vector search powers transformers technology, but real-world use demands hybrid queries that combine vector similarity with attribute filters (e.g., "top document in category X, from 2023"). Current solutions trade off recall, speed, and flexibility, relying on fragile index hacks that don't scale. We introduce FusedANN (Fused Attribute-Vector Nearest Neighbor), a geometric framework that elevates filtering to ANN optimization constraints and introduces a convex fused space via a Lagrangian-like relaxation. Our method jointly embeds attributes and vectors through transformer-based convexification, turning hard filters into continuous, weighted penalties that preserve top-k semantics while enabling efficient approximate search. We prove that FusedANN reduces to exact filtering under high selectivity, gracefully relaxes to semantically nearest attributes when exact matches are insufficient, and preserves downstream ANN alpha-approximation guarantees. Empirically, FusedANN improves query throughput by eliminating brittle filtering stages, achieving superior recall-latency tradeoffs on standard hybrid benchmarks without specialized index hacks, delivering up to 3 times higher throughput and better recall than state-of-the-art hybrid and graph-based systems. Theoretically, we provide explicit error bounds and parameter selection rules that make FusedANN practical for production. This establishes a principled, scalable, and verifiable bridge between symbolic constraints and vector similarity, unlocking a new generation of filtered retrieval systems for large, hybrid, and dynamic NLP/ML workloads.

We present a complete formalization in Isabelle/HOL of the object part of an equivalence between L-mosaics and bounded join-semilattices, employing an AI-assisted methodology that integrates large language models as reasoning assistants throughout the proof development process. The equivalence was originally established by Cangiotti, Linzi, and Talotti in their study of hypercompositional structures related to orthomodular lattices and quantum logic. Our formalization rigorously verifies the main theoretical result and demonstrates the mutual inverse property of the transformations establishing this equivalence. The development showcases both the mathematical depth of multivalued algebraic operations and the potential for AI-enhanced interactive theorem proving in tackling complex formalization projects.

Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.

Dynamically Optimal Unraveling Schemes for Simulating Lindblad Equations
Yu Cao, Mingfeng He, Xiantao Li
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Stochastic unraveling schemes are powerful computational tools for simulating Lindblad equations, offering significant reductions in memory requirements. However, this advantage is accompanied by increased stochastic uncertainty, and the question of optimal unraveling remains open. In this work, we investigate unraveling schemes driven by Brownian motion or Poisson processes and present a comprehensive parametric characterization of these approaches. For the case of a single Lindblad operator and one noise term, this parametric family provides a complete description for unraveling scheme with pathwise norm-preservation. We further analytically derive dynamically optimal quantum state diffusion (DO-QSD) and dynamically optimal quantum jump process (DO-QJP) that minimize the short-time growth of the variance of an observable. Compared to jump process ansatz, DO-QSD offers two notable advantages: firstly, the variance for DO-QSD can be rigorously shown not to exceed that of any jump-process ansatz locally in time; secondly, it has very simple expressions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DO-QSD scheme may achieve substantial reductions in the variance of observables and the resulting simulation error.

Pure Exploration via Frank-Wolfe Self-Play

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy, yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free, tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm, bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

How deep is your network? Deep vs. shallow learning of transfer operators

We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover, it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems, and the Schrödinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum harmonic oscillator.

We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.

This study presents FREDopt, a newly developed GPU-accelerated open-source optimization software for simultaneous proton dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) optimization in IMPT treatment planning. FREDopt was implemented entirely in Python, leveraging CuPy for GPU acceleration and incorporating fast Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the FRED code. The treatment plan optimization workflow includes pre-optimization and optimization, the latter equipped with a novel superiorization of feasibility-seeking algorithms. Feasibility-seeking requires finding a point that satisfies prescribed constraints. Superiorization interlaces computational perturbations into iterative feasibility-seeking steps to steer them toward a superior feasible point, replacing the need for costly full-fledged constrained optimization. The method was validated on two treatment plans of patients treated in a clinical proton therapy center, with dose and LETd distributions compared before and after reoptimization. Simultaneous dose and LETd optimization using FREDopt led to a substantial reduction of LETd and (dose)x(LETd) in organs at risk (OARs) while preserving target dose conformity. Computational performance evaluation showed execution times of 14-50 minutes, depending on the algorithm and target volume size-satisfactory for clinical and research applications while enabling further development of the well-tested, documented open-source software.

During an epidemic outbreak, decision makers crucially need accurate and robust tools to monitor the pathogen propagation. The effective reproduction number, defined as the expected number of secondary infections stemming from one contaminated individual, is a state-of-the-art indicator quantifying the epidemic intensity. Numerous estimators have been developed to precisely track the reproduction number temporal evolution. Yet, COVID-19 pandemic surveillance raised unprecedented challenges due to the poor quality of worldwide reported infection counts. When monitoring the epidemic in different territories simultaneously, leveraging the spatial structure of data significantly enhances both the accuracy and robustness of reproduction number estimates. However, this requires a good estimate of the spatial structure. To tackle this major limitation, the present work proposes a joint estimator of the reproduction number and connectivity structure. The procedure is assessed through intensive numerical simulations on carefully designed synthetic data and illustrated on real COVID-19 spatiotemporal infection counts.

Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.

In this paper, we study the ergodic theorem for infinite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups, originally introduced by Frigerio and Verri in 1982, and its latest version developed by Carbone and Girotti in 2021. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures exponential convergence towards the positive recurrent subspace, a well-known result for irreducible quantum Markov semigroups in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Several illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the ergodic theorem. Moreover, we show that the positive recurrent subspace plays a crucial role in the study of global asymptotic stability.

Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Title:
A Quantum Algorithm For Computing Contextuality Bounds
Colm Kelleher, Frédéric Holweck
Comments:
35 pages, 18 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Quantum contextuality is a limitation on deterministic hidden variable models, testable in measurement scenarios where outcomes differ under quantum or classical descriptions due to a common set of constraints. When considering measurements of $N$-qubit spin operators, constraints arise from commutation relations and classical bounds are determined by the $\textit{degree}$ of contextuality, an NP-hard quantity to compute in general, related to the larger class of optimisation problems known as $\texttt{MaxLin2}$. In this work we give a quantum algorithm based on Grover's search algorithm, computing the degree of contextuality in $O(\sqrt{n} \log\log{n})$ in $n$ states, a speedup over classical brute force method. We also study variations of Grover which encode the relevant information in the phases of the basis states, reducing circuit width and depth requirements with indicative complexity of $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\log{n})^{2}\log\log{n})$. Testing on contemporary quantum backends with the IBM quantum experience gives inconclusive outputs due to noise-induced errors, an issue hopefully fixed by future hardware.

When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.

Monitoring Violations of Differential Privacy over Time

Subjects:

Auditing differential privacy has emerged as an important area of research that supports the design of privacy-preserving mechanisms. Privacy audits help to obtain empirical estimates of the privacy parameter, to expose flawed implementations of algorithms and to compare practical with theoretical privacy guarantees. In this work, we investigate an unexplored facet of privacy auditing: the sustained auditing of a mechanism that can go through changes during its development or deployment. Monitoring the privacy of algorithms over time comes with specific challenges. Running state-of-the-art (static) auditors repeatedly requires excessive sampling efforts, while the reliability of such methods deteriorates over time without proper adjustments. To overcome these obstacles, we present a new monitoring procedure that extracts information from the entire deployment history of the algorithm. This allows us to reduce sampling efforts, while sustaining reliable outcomes of our auditor. We derive formal guarantees with regard to the soundness of our methods and evaluate their performance for important mechanisms from the literature. Our theoretical findings and experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Alignment-Sensitive Minimax Rates for Spectral Algorithms with Learned Kernels
Dongming Huang, Zhifan Li, Yicheng Li, Qian Lin
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

On Robustness of Consensus over Pseudo-Undirected Path Graphs

Subjects:

Consensus over networked agents is typically studied using undirected or directed communication graphs. Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in information exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states, while directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root nodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on achievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network topologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional connectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to differ, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions. The resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus under connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the system to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull of the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights for a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous interception of a moving target.

A Recovery Guarantee for Sparse Neural Networks

We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks, where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered. Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

Adaptive Event-Triggered Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Systems and Control (eess.SY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on time-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed intervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and communication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG (Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms, ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios with inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to exchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with any policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.

Exponent Function for Stationary Memoryless Channels with Input Cost at Rates above the Capacity
Yasutada Oohama
Comments:
20pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1701.06357
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT)
We consider the stationaly memoryless channels with input cost. We prove that for transmission rates above the capacity the correct probability of decoding tends to zero exponentially as the block length $n$ of codes tends to infinity. In the case where both of channel input and output sets are finite, we determine the optimal exponent function on the above exponential decay of the correct probability. To derive this result we use a new technique called the recuresive method, which is based on the information spectrum approach. The recursive method utilize a certain recursive structure on the information spectrum quantities.

We give a practical method for computing the 3-torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of a genus 3 hyperelliptic curve. We define a scheme for the 3-torsion points of the Jacobian and use complex approximations, homotopy continuation and lattice reduction to find precise expression for the 3-torsion. In the latter stages of the paper, we explain how the 3-torsion subgroup can be used to compute the wild part of the local exponent of the conductor at 2.

On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.

Distributivity in lattices of torsion classes over finite-dimensional algebras

Let $A$ be a basic finite-dimensional algebra and denote by $\operatorname{tors} A$ the collection of all all torsion classes of $A$. It has been proved in \cite{Demonet} that $\operatorname{tors} A$ is always a completely semidistributive lattice. In the present paper, we investigate the distributivity of this lattice and proved that the lattice is distributive if and only if the algebra is the finite direct product of finite-dimensional local algebras.

We determine the action of the automorphism group Aut$(G)$ on the set of irreducible characters Irr$(G)$ for all finite quasi-simple groups $G$. For groups of Lie type, this includes the construction of an Aut$(G)$-equivariant Jordan decomposition of characters (Theorem B). We prove a property called $A(\infty)$ which includes an extendibility statement, known previously in types not $\mathrm{D}$ (Theorem A). Our methods blend here Shintani descent ideas introduced for type $\mathrm{B}$ along with an analysis of semisimple classes in the dual group $G^*$. The condition $A(\infty)$ originates in the program to prove the McKay conjecture using the classification of finite simple groups. Theorem C establishes the McKay conjecture for the prime 3.

Big Ramsey Degrees of Countable Ordinals
Joanna Boyland, William Gasarch, Nathan Hurtig, Robert Rust
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
Ramsey's theorem states that for all finite colorings of an infinite set, there exists an infinite homogeneous subset. What if we seek a homogeneous subset that is also order-equivalent to the original set? Let $S$ be a linearly ordered set and $a \in N$. The big Ramsey degree of $a$ in $S$, denoted $T(a,S)$, is the least integer $t$ such that, for any finite coloring of the $a$-subsets of $S$, there exists $S'\subseteq S$ such that (i) $S'$ is order-equivalent to $S$, and (ii) if the coloring is restricted to the $a$-subsets of $S'$ then at most $t$ colors are used.
Mašulović \& Šobot (2019) showed that $T(a,\omega+\omega)=2^a$. From this one can obtain $T(a,\zeta)=2^a$. We give a direct proof that $T(a,\zeta)=2^a$.
Mašulović and Šobot (2019) also showed that for all countable ordinals $\alpha < \omega^\omega$, and for all $a \in N$, $T(a,\alpha)$ is finite. We find exact value of $T(a,\alpha)$ for all ordinals less than $\omega^\omega$ and all $a\in N$.

Solving the cohomological equation for locally hamiltonian flows, part II -- global obstructions

Continuing the research initiated in \cite{Fr-Ki2}, we study the existence of solutions and their regularity for the cohomological equations $X u=f$ for locally Hamiltonian flows (determined by the vector field $X$) on a compact surface $M$ of genus $g\geq 1$. We move beyond the case studied so far by Forni in \cite{Fo1,Fo3}, when the flow is minimal over the entire surface and the function $f$ satisfies some Sobolev regularity conditions. We deal with the flow restricted to any its minimal component and any smooth function $f$ whenever the flow satisfies the Full Filtration Diophantine Condition (FFDC) (this is a full measure condition). The main goal of this article is to quantify optimal regularity of solutions. For this purpose we construct a family of invariant distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$, $\bar{t}\in\mathscr{TF}^*$ that play the roles of the Forni's invariant distributions introduced in \cite{Fo1,Fo3} by using the language of translation surfaces. The distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$ are global in nature (as emphasized in the title of the article), unlike the distributions $\mathfrak{d}^k_{\sigma,j}$, $(\sigma,k,j)\in\mathscr{TD}$ and $\mathfrak{C}^k_{\sigma,l}$, $(\sigma,k,l)\in\mathscr{TC}$ introduced in \cite{Fr-Ki2}, which are defined locally. All three families are used to determine the optimal regularity of the solutions for the cohomological equation, see Theorem 1.1 and 1.2. As a by-product, we also obtained, interesting in itself, a spectral result (Theorem 1.3) for the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle acting on functional spaces arising naturally at the transition to the first-return map.

Asymmetric Feedback Learning in Online Convex Games
Zifan Wang, Xinlei Yi, Yi Shen, Michael M. Zavlanos, Karl H. Johansson
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
This paper considers convex games involving multiple agents that aim to minimize their own cost functions using locally available information. A common assumption in the study of such games is that the agents are symmetric, meaning that they have access to the same type of information. Here we lift this assumption, which is often violated in practice, and instead consider asymmetric agents; specifically, we assume some agents have access to first-order gradient information and others have access to the zeroth-order oracles (cost function evaluations). We propose an asymmetric learning algorithm that combines the agent information mechanisms. We analyze the regret and Nash equilibrium convergence of this algorithm for convex and strongly monotone games, respectively. Specifically, we show that our algorithm always performs between pure first- and zeroth-order methods, and can match the performance of these two extremes by adjusting the number of agents with access to zeroth-order oracles. Therefore, our algorithm incorporates the pure first- and zeroth-order methods as special cases. We provide numerical experiments on a market problem for both deterministic and risk-averse games to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

A Morse theoretical approach to Fourier transforms of holonomic D-modules in dimension one
Kazuki Kudomi, Kiyoshi Takeuchi
Comments:
substantially revised, 54 pages
Subjects:
Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)
We study Fourier transforms of holonomic D-modules on the complex affine line and show that their enhanced solution complexes are described by a twisted Morse theory. We thus recover and even strengthen the well-known formula for their exponential factors i.e. the stationary phase method. Moreover, we define a Lagrangian cycle that we call the irregular characteristic cycle and describe the enhanced solution complex of the Fourier transform by it. In this way, we obtain a new perspective, from which we can geometrically see how the standard properties of holonomic D-modules are transformed via the Fourier transform. In the course of our study, a formula for the (classical) characteristic cycles of the Fourier transforms will be also obtained and natural bases of their holomorphic solutions will be constructed via rapid decay homology cycles.

On the Absolute-Value Integral of a Brownian Motion with Drift: Exact and Asymptotic Formulae
Weixuan Xia, Yuyang Zhang
Comments:
35 pages, 4 tables, 5 figures; updated references
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Complex Variables (math.CV)
The present paper is concerned with the integral of the absolute value of a Brownian motion with drift. By establishing an asymptotic expansion of the space Laplace transform, we obtain series representations for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the integral, making use of Meijer's G-function. A functional recursive formula is derived for the moments, which is shown to yield only exponentials and Gauss' error function up to arbitrary orders, permitting exact computations. To obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for small- and large-deviation probabilities, we employ a marginal space-time Laplace transform and apply a newly developed generalization of Laplace's method to exponential Airy integrals. The impact of drift on the complete distribution of the integral is explored in depth. The resultant new formulae complement existing ones in the standard Brownian motion case to great extent in terms of both theoretical generality and modeling capacity and have been presented for easy implementation, which numerical experiments demonstrate.

Hopf orbits and the first ECH capacity

Subjects:

We consider dynamically convex star-shaped domains in a symplectic vector space of dimension $4$. For such a domain, a ``Hopf orbit'' is a closed characteristic in the boundary which is unknotted and has self-linking number $-1$. We show that the minimum action among Hopf orbits exists and defines a symplectic capacity for dynamically convex star-shaped domains. We further show that this capacity agrees with the first ECH capacity for such domains. Combined with a result of Edtmair, this implies that for dynamically convex star-shaped domains in four dimensions, the first ECH capacity agrees with the cylinder capacity. This also provides a method to show that the first ECH capacity of a dynamically convex star-shaped domain satisfies the axioms of a normalized symplectic capacity without any need for Seiberg-Witten theory.

Characterization of the asymptotic behavior of $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices
Tâm Le Minh
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
We consider $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices, arrays invariant to separate permutations of rows and columns and common in bipartite data. Under the standard dissociation assumption, we develop a graph-indexed analogue of the Hoeffding decomposition tailored to RCE dependence. We present a new decomposition based on orthogonal projections onto probability spaces generated by sets of Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg variables. These sets are indexed by bipartite graphs, enabling the application of graph-theoretic concepts to describe the decomposition. This framework provides new insights into the characterization of $U$-statistics on row-column exchangeable matrices, particularly their asymptotic behavior, including in degenerate cases. Notably, the limit distribution depends only on specific terms in the decomposition, corresponding to non-zero components indexed by the smallest graphs, namely the principal support graphs. We show that the asymptotic behavior of a $U$-statistic is characterized by the properties of its principal support graphs. The number of nodes in these graphs (the principal degree) dictates the convergence rate to the limit distribution, with degeneracy occurring if and only if this number is strictly greater than 1. Furthermore, when the principal support graphs are connected, the limit distribution is Gaussian, even in degenerate cases. Applications to network analysis illustrate these findings.

Scaled quadratic variation for controlled rough paths and parameter estimation of fractional diffusions

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
We introduce the concept of finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation along a sequence of partitions for paths on a given interval. This concept, with historical roots in the study of Gaussian processes by Gladyshev (1961) and Klein \& Giné (1975), includes the fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with Hurst index $H$, which has finite $1-2H$-scaled quadratic variation. We show that a path that is controlled by a path with finite $\gamma$-scaled quadratic variation in the sense of M. Gubinelli inherits this property, and the corresponding scaled quadratic variation satisfies an Itô-isometry type formula. Moreover, we prove quantitative error bounds that establish a relationship between the convergence rates of the scaled quadratic variation of the controlled path and that of the controlling path. Additionally, we introduce a consistent estimator for the parameter $\gamma$ based on a single sample path, complete with quantitative error bounds. We apply these results to the parameter estimation for fractional diffusions. Our findings specify convergence rates for the estimation of both the Hurst index and the parameters in the noise vector fields. The paper concludes with numerical experiments that substantiate our theoretical findings.

A Combinatorial Perspective on Random Access Efficiency for DNA Storage
Anina Gruica, Daniella Bar-Lev, Alberto Ravagnani, Eitan Yaakobi
Subjects:
Information Theory (cs.IT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We investigate the fundamental limits of the recently proposed random access coverage depth problem for DNA data storage. Under this paradigm, it is assumed that the user information consists of $k$ information strands, which are encoded into $n$ strands via a generator matrix $G$. During the sequencing process, the strands are read uniformly at random, as each strand is available in a large number of copies. In this context, the random access coverage depth problem refers to the expected number of reads (i.e., sequenced strands) required to decode a specific information strand requested by the user. This problem heavily depends on the generator matrix $G$, and besides computing the expectation for different choices of $G$, the goal is to construct matrices that minimize the maximum expectation over all possible requested information strands, denoted by $T_{\max}(G)$.
In this paper, we introduce new techniques to investigate the random access coverage depth problem, capturing its combinatorial nature and identifying the structural properties of generator matrices that are advantageous. We establish two general formulas to determine $T_{\max}(G)$ for arbitrary generator matrices. The first formula depends on the linear dependencies between columns of $G$, whereas the second formula takes into account recovery sets and their intersection structure. We also introduce the concept of recovery balanced codes and provide three sufficient conditions for a code to be recovery balanced. These conditions can be used to compute $T_{\max}(G)$ for various families of codes, such as MDS, simplex, Hamming, and binary Reed-Muller codes. Additionally, we study the performance of modified systematic MDS and simplex matrices, showing that the best results for $T_{\max}(G)$ are achieved with a specific combination of encoded strands and replication of the information strands.

This paper aims to develop and provide a rigorous treatment to the problem of entropy regularized fine-tuning in the context of continuous-time diffusion models, which was recently proposed by Uehara et al. (arXiv:2402.15194, 2024). The idea is to use stochastic control for sample generation, where the entropy regularizer is introduced to mitigate reward collapse. We also show how the analysis can be extended to fine-tuning with a general $f$-divergence regularizer. Numerical experiments on large-scale text-to-image models--Stable Diffusion v1.5 are conducted to validate our approach.

[In case i), it is understood these are continuous.] The actual statement is much stronger: for all $r \geq 1$, under "suitable" assumptions, triangular representations $\rho_r: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ lift to $\rho_{r+1}: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1})$, in the strongest possible step-by-step sense. Here "suitable" is made precise by the concept of $\textit{Kummer flag}$. An essential aspect of this work, is to identify the common properties of groups i) and ii), that suffice to ensure the existence of such lifts.

We establish a theory of scalar Fourier coefficients for a class of non-holomorphic, automorphic forms on the quaternionic real Lie group $\mathrm{U}(2,n)$. By studying the theta lifts of holomorphic modular forms from $\mathrm{U}(1,1)$, we apply this theory to obtain examples of non-holomorphic cusp forms on $\mathrm{U}(2,n)$ whose Fourier coefficients are algebraic numbers.

The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Genus Zero Partition Function

Journal-ref:
SIGMA 21 (2025), 079, 90 pages
Subjects:
Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We compute the genus 0 free energy for the 2-matrix model with quartic interactions, which acts as a generating function for the Ising model's partition function on a random, 4-regular, planar graph. This is consistent with the predictions of Kazakov and Boulatov on this model, as well as subsequent confirmation of this formula using combinatorial methods. We also provide a new parametric formula for the free energy and give a characterization of the phase space. Our analysis is based on a steepest descent Riemann-Hilbert analysis of the associated biorthogonal polynomials and the corresponding isomonodromic $\tau$-function. A key ingredient in the analysis is a parametrization of the spectral curve. This analysis lays the groundwork for the subsequent study of the multicritical point, which we will study in a forthcoming work.

The empirical copula process in high dimensions: Stute's representation and applications

Comments:
35 pages, including an appendix of 7 pages
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST)
The empirical copula process, a fundamental tool for copula inference, is studied in the high dimensional regime where the dimension is allowed to grow to infinity exponentially in the sample size. Under natural, weak smoothness assumptions on the underlying copula, it is shown that Stute's representation is valid in the following sense: all low-dimensional margins of fixed dimension of the empirical copula process can be approximated by a functional of the low-dimensional margins of the standard empirical process, with the almost sure error term being uniform in the margins. The result has numerous potential applications, and is exemplary applied to the problem of testing pairwise stochastic independence in high dimensions, leading to various extensions of recent results in the literature: for certain test statistics based on pairwise association measures, type-I error control is obtained for models beyond mutual independence. Moreover, bootstrap-based critical values are shown to yield strong control of the familywise error rate for a large class of data generating processes.

Explicit Steady-State Approximations for Parallel Server Systems with Heterogeneous Servers

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC)
We study the steady-state performance of parallel-server systems under an immediate routing architecture with two sources of heterogeneity: servers and job classes, subject to compatibility constraints. We focus on the weighted-workload-task-allocation (WWTA) policy, a load-balancing scheme known to be throughput-optimal for such systems. Under a relaxed complete-resource-pooling (CRP) condition, we prove a "strong form" of state-space collapse in heavy traffic and that the scaled workload of each server converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, whose parameter is explicitly given by system primitives. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, the conventional heavy-traffic requirement of a unique static allocation plan can be dropped; a relaxed CRP condition suffices. Second, the limiting workload distribution is shown to be independent of local scheduling policy on server side, allowing substantial flexibility. Third, the inefficient (non-basic) activities prescribed by static allocation plan is proved to receive an asymptotically negligible fraction of routing and service, even though WWTA has no prior knowledge of which activities are basic, highlighting its robustness to changing arrival rates.

It is shown that if $A$ is a Borel subset of the first Heisenberg group with $\dim A >2$, then vertical projections of $A$ almost surely have dimension at least $1+ \frac{1}{2} \dim A$, with respect to the Korányi metric. This improves the known bound when $2 < \dim A < 8/3$. The proof relies on a variable coefficient local smoothing inequality, and a Kakeya-type bound for light ray tubes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ originally due to S. Wu.

We consider the random right-angled Coxeter group $W_{\Gamma}$ whose presentation graph $\Gamma\sim \mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ is an Erd{\H o}s--Rényi random graph on $n$ vertices with edge probability $p=p(n)$. We establish that $p=1/\sqrt{n}$ is a threshold for relative hyperbolicity of the random group $W_{\Gamma}$. As a key step in the proof, we determine the minimal number of pairs of generators that must commute in a right-angled Coxeter group which is not relatively hyperbolic, a result which is of independent interest.
We also show that there is an interval of edge probabilities of width $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$ in which the random right-angled Coxeter group has precisely cubic divergence. This interval is between the thresholds for relative hyperbolicity (whence exponential divergence) and quadratic divergence. Moreover, a simple random walk on any Cayley graph of the random right-angled Coxeter group for $p$ in this interval satisfies a central limit theorem.

Well posedness of F. John's floating body problem for a fixed object

The goal of this paper is to prove the well-posedness of F. John's floating body problem in the case of a fixed object and for unsteady waves, in horizontal dimension $d=1$ and with a possibly emerging bottom. This problem describes the interactions of waves with a partially immersed object using the linearized Bernoulli equations. The fluid domain $\Omega$ therefore has corners where the object meets the free surface, which consists of various connected components. The energy space associated with this problem involves the space of traces on these different connected components of all functions in the Beppo-Levi space $\dot{H}^1(\Omega)$; we characterize this space, exhibiting non local effects linking the different connected components. We prove the well-posedness of the Laplace equation in corner domains, with mixed boundary conditions and Dirichlet data in this trace space, and study several properties of the associated Dirichlet-Neumann operator (self-adjointness, ellipticity properties, etc.). This trace space being only semi-normed, we cannot use standard semi-group theory to solve F. John's problem: one has to choose a realization of the homogeneous space (i.e. choose an adequate representative in the equivalence class) we are working with. When the fluid domain is bounded, this realization is obtained by imposing a zero-mass condition; for unbounded fluid domains, we have to choose a space-time realization which can be interpreted as a particular choice of the Bernoulli constant. Well-posedness in the energy space is then proved. Conditions for higher order regularity in times are then derived, which yield some limited space regularity that can be improved through smallness assumption on the contact angles. We finally show that higher order regularity away from the contact points can be achieved through weighted estimates.

A family of $r$ distinct sets $\{A_1,\ldots, A_r\}$ is an $r$-sunflower if for all $1 \leqslant i < j \leqslant r$ and $1 \leqslant i' < j' \leqslant r$, we have $A_i \cap A_j = A_{i'} \cap A_{j'}$. Erdős and Rado conjectured in 1960 that every family $\mathcal{H}$ of $\ell$-element sets of size at least $K(r)^\ell$ contains an $r$-sunflower, where $K(r)$ is some function that depends only on $r$. We prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a family of $\ell$-element sets of VC-dimension at most $d$ and $|\mathcal{H}| > (C r (\log d+\log^\ast \ell))^\ell$ for some absolute constant $C > 0$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains an $r$-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk. When $d=1$, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that $|\mathcal{H}| > (r-1)^\ell$ is sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent interest.

This is in contrast with the results known in the Euclidean case, in which for symbols $P(\xi) = |\xi|^a$ with $a > 1$ the exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is sufficient, but we do not know if it is necessary.

Fair Clustering with Minimum Representation Constraints

Clustering is a well-studied unsupervised learning task that aims to partition data points into a number of clusters. In many applications, these clusters correspond to real-world constructs (e.g., electoral districts, playlists, TV channels), where a group (e.g., social or demographic) benefits only if it reaches a minimum level of representation in the cluster (e.g., 50% to elect their preferred candidate). In this paper, we study the k-means and k-medians clustering problems under the additional fairness constraint that each group must attain a minimum level of representation in at least a specified number of clusters. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer (nonlinear) optimization problem and propose an alternating minimization algorithm, called MiniReL, to solve it. Although incorporating fairness constraints results in an NP-hard assignment problem within the MiniReL algorithm, we present several heuristic strategies that make the approach practical even for large datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that our method yields fair clusters without increasing clustering cost across standard benchmark datasets.

Let $H = -d^2/dx^2 + q(x)$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, where $q(x)$ is a periodic potential, and suppose that the spectrum $\sigma(H)$ of $H$ is the positive semi-axis $[0, \infty)$. In the case where $q(x)$ is real-valued (and locally square-integrable) a well-known result of G. Borg states that $q(x)$ must vanish almost everywhere. However, as it was first observed by M.G. Gasymov, there is an abundance of complex-valued potentials for which $\sigma(H) = [0, \infty)$.
In this article we conjecture a characterization of all complex-valued entire potentials whose spectrum is $[0, \infty)$. We also present an analog of Borg's result for complex potentials.

A proof of Lagrange's and Jacobi's four-square theorem due to Hurwitz utilizes orders in a quaternion algebra over the rationals. Seeking a generalization of this technique to orders over number fields, we identify two key components: an order with a good factorization theory and the condition that all orbits under the action of the group of elements of norm $1$ acting by multiplication intersect the suborder corresponding to the quadratic form to be studied. We use recent results on class numbers of quaternion orders and then find all suborders satisfying the orbit condition. Subsequently, we obtain universality and formulas for the number of representations by the corresponding quadratic forms. We also present a quaternionic proof of Götzky's four-square theorem.

Such functions can be realized as transfer functions of infinite dimensional dichotomous discrete-time linear systems, and we employ the strict bounded real lemma for this class of systems, together with associated Krein space theory, to derive explicit formulas for the left and right canonical factorizations.

On high-order/low-order and micro-macro methods for implicit time-stepping of the BGK model
Cory Hauck, M. Paul Laiu, Stefan Schnake
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, a high-order/low-order (HOLO) method is combined with a micro-macro (MM) decomposition to accelerate iterative solvers in fully implicit time-stepping of the BGK equation for gas dynamics. The MM formulation represents a kinetic distribution as the sum of a local Maxwellian and a perturbation. In highly collisional regimes, the perturbation away from initial and boundary layers is small and can be compressed to reduce the overall storage cost of the distribution. The convergence behavior of the MM methods, the usual HOLO method, and the standard source iteration method is analyzed on a linear BGK model. Both the HOLO and MM methods are implemented using a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization in phase space, which naturally preserves the consistency between high- and low-order models required by the HOLO approach. The accuracy and performance of these methods are compared on the Sod shock tube problem and a sudden wall heating boundary layer problem. Overall, the results demonstrate the robustness of the MM and HOLO approaches and illustrate the compression benefits enabled by the MM formulation when the kinetic distribution is near equilibrium.

Characterisation of asymptotic behaviour of perturbed deterministic and stochastic pantograph equations

Subjects:
Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA); Probability (math.PR)
This paper considers the asymptotic behaviour of deterministically and stochastically forced linear pantograph equations. The asymptotic behaviour is studied in the case when all solutions of the pantograph equation without forcing tend to a trivial equilibrium. In all cases, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the forcing terms which enable all solutions to converge to the equilibrium of the unforced equation, and which enable solutions to remain bounded. In the deterministic case, we give sharp conditions on forcing terms which enable the solutions of the forced equations to inherit the power law behaviour of the unforced equation, as well as slower rates of decay or growth not present in the unforced equation. Extensions to equations with general unbounded delay, and to finite--dimensional equations are also presented.

Data privacy is a significant concern when using numerical simulations for sensitive information such as medical, financial, or engineering data -- especially in untrusted environments like public cloud infrastructures. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution for achieving data privacy by enabling secure computations directly on encrypted data. Aimed at computational scientists, this work explores the viability of FHE-based, privacy-preserving numerical simulations of partial differential equations. The presented approach utilizes the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, a widely used FHE method for approximate arithmetic on real numbers. Two Julia packages are introduced, OpenFHE$.$jl and SecureArithmetic$.$jl, which wrap the OpenFHE C++ library to provide a convenient interface for secure arithmetic operations. With these tools, the accuracy and performance of key FHE operations in OpenFHE are evaluated, and implementations of finite difference schemes for solving the linear advection equation with encrypted data are demonstrated. The results show that cryptographically secure numerical simulations are possible, but that careful consideration must be given to the computational overhead and the numerical errors introduced by using FHE. An analysis of the algorithmic restrictions imposed by FHE highlights potential challenges and solutions for extending the approach to other models and methods. While it remains uncertain how broadly the approach can be generalized to more complex algorithms due to CKKS limitations, these findings lay the groundwork for further research on privacy-preserving scientific computing.

What is the maximum number of $r$-term sums admitting rational values in $n$-element sets of irrational numbers? We determine the maximum when $r<4$ or $r\geq n/2$ and also in case when we drop the condition on the number of summands. It turns out that the $r$-term sum problem is equivalent to determine the maximum number of $r$-term zero-sum subsequences in $n$-element sequences of integers, which can be seen as a variant of the famous Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem.

On the inadequacy of nudging data assimilation algorithms for non-dissipative systems

Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
In this work, we study the applicability of the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) nudging algorithm for continuous data assimilation to evolutionary dynamical systems that are not dissipative. Specifically, we apply the AOT algorithm to a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in 1D, and the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Our analysis reveals that both the Euler and KdV equations lack the finitely many determining modes property, leading to the construction of infinitely many solutions with exactly the same sparse observational data, which data assimilation methods cannot distinguish between. Simultaneously, we numerically verify that the AOT algorithm successfully recovers these counterexamples for the damped and driven KdV equation, which is dissipative. Additionally, to further support our argument, we present numerical evidence showing that the AOT algorithm is ineffective at accurately recovering solutions for a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system.

On Multilevel Energy-Based Fragmentation Methods
James Barker, Michael Griebel, Jan Hamaekers
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Energy-based fragmentation methods approximate the potential energy of a molecular system as a sum of contribution terms built from the energies of particular subsystems. Some such methods reduce to truncations of the many-body expansion (MBE); others combine subsystem energies in a manner inspired by the principle of inclusion/exclusion (PIE). The combinatorial technique of Möbius inversion of sums over partially ordered sets, which generalizes the PIE, is known to provide a non-recursive expression for the MBE contribution terms, and has also been connected to related cluster expansion methods. We build from these ideas a very general framework for decomposing potential functions into energetic contribution terms associated with elements of particular partially ordered sets (posets) and direct products thereof. Specific choices immediately reproduce not only the MBE, but also a number of other existing decomposition forms, including, e.g., the multilevel ML-BOSSANOVA schema. Furthermore, a different choice of poset product leads to a setup familiar from the combination technique for high-dimensional approximation, which has a known connection to quantum-chemical composite methods. We present the ML-SUPANOVA decomposition form, which allows the further refinement of the terms of an MBE-like expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer potential according to systematic hierarchies of ab initio methods and of basis sets. We outline an adaptive algorithm for the a posteori construction of quasi-optimal truncations of this decomposition. Some initial experiments are reported and discussed.

Using a Milnor-Moore argument we show that, $K(2)$-locally at the prime $2$, the spectra $MU\langle 6\rangle$ and $MString$ split as direct sums of Morava $E$-theories after tensoring with a finite Galois extension of the sphere called $E^{hF_{3/2}}$. In the case of $MString$ we are able to refine this splitting in several ways: we show that the projection maps are determined by spin characteristic classes, that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation admits a unital section after tensoring with $E^{hF_{3/2}}$, and that the splitting can be improved to one of $E^{hH}\otimes MString$ into a direct sum of shifts of $TMF_0(3)$ where $H$ is an open subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group of index $4$.

A method of solution for the inverse problem for $h$-functions of planar Brownian motion

Probability (math.PR); Complex Variables (math.CV)
Given a planar domain $D$, the harmonic measure distribution function $h_D(r)$, with base point $z$, is the harmonic measure with pole at $z$ of the parts of the boundary which are within a distance $r$ of $z$. Equivalently it is the probability Brownian motion started from $z$ first strikes the boundary within a distance $r$ from $z$. We call $h_D$ the $h$-function of $D$, this function captures geometrical aspects of the domain, such as connectivity, or curvature of the boundary. This paper is concerned with the inverse problem: given a suitable function $h$, does there exist a domain $D$ such that $h = h_D$? To answer this, we first extend the concept of a $h$-function of a domain to one of a stopping time $\tau$ . By using the conformal invariance of Brownian motion we solve the inverse problem for that of a stopping time. The associated stopping time will be the projection of a hitting time of the real line. If this projection corresponds to the hitting time of a domain $D$, then this technique solves the original inverse problem. We have found a large family of examples such that the associated stopping time is that of a hitting time.

In this paper we investigate line bundles on $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$ the moduli stack of parahoric Bruhat--Tits bundles over a smooth projective curve. Translating this problem into one concerning twisted conformal blocks, we are able to establish criteria that detect when line bundles on an appropriate flag variety descend to $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$. Along the way we establish a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport which describes sections of line bundles on $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$ using representation-theoretical means. We conclude the paper with examples where our methods allow us to explicitly determine the Picard group of $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$.

Title:
Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds

We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a Kähler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous Kähler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous Kähler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.

Pal's isominwidth problem in the hyperbolic space
Karoly J. Boroczky, Ansgar Freyer, Adam Sagmeister
Subjects:
Metric Geometry (math.MG)
The paper focuses on possible hyperbolic versions of the classical Pal isominwidth inequality in R^2 from 1921, which states that for a fixed minimal width, the regular triangle has minimal area. We note that the isominwidth problem is still wide open in R^n for n>2. Recent work on the isominwidth problem on the sphere S^2 shows that the solution is the regular spherical triangle when the width is at most \pi/2 according to Bezdek and Blekherman, while Freyer and Sagmeister proved that the minimizer is the polar of a spherical Reuleaux triangle when the minimal width is greater than \pi/2.
In this paper, the hyperbolic isominwidth problem is discussed with respect to the probably most natural notion of width due to Lassak in the hyperbolic space H^n where strips bounded by a supporting hyperplane and a corresponding hypersphere are considered. On the one hand, we show that the volume of a convex body of given minimal Lassak width w>0 in H^n might be arbitrarily small; therefore, the isominwidth problem for convex bodies in H^n does not make sense. On the other hand, in the two-dimensional case, we prove that among horocyclically convex bodies of given Lassak width in H^2, the area is minimized by the regular horocyclic triangle.

Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws

Subjects:

This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.

Subjects:

We survey mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds from the perspective of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their period integrals. Special emphasis is laid on distinguished properties of the hypergeometric series of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky that appear in mirror symmetry. After defining mirror symmetry in terms of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds, we summarize a general construction of moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces (complete intersections) in toric varieties. We review the central charge formula, and assuming it, we show mirror symmetry for the pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds associated with reflexive polytopes. By describing the moduli spaces globally, we present interesting examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds where birational geometry and geometry of Fourier-Mukai partners of a Calabi-Yau manifold arise from the study of mirror symmetry.

The systolic area $\alpha_{sys}$ of a nonsimply connected compact Riemannian surface $(M,g)$ is defined as its area divided by the square of the systole, where the systole is equal to the length of a shortest noncontractible closed curve. The systolic inequality due to Bavard states that on the Klein bottle, the systolic area has the optimal lower bound $\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$. Bavard also constructed metrics of minimal systolic area in any given conformal class. We give an alternative proof of these results, which also yields an estimate on the systolic defect $\alpha_{sys}-\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$ in terms of the $L^2$-distance of the conformal factor to the metric which minimizes the systolic area. On the Möbius strip, we also prove similar estimates for metrics in fixed conformal classes.

Odd Verma's Theorem

Subjects:
Representation Theory (math.RT); Combinatorics (math.CO)
We formulate several basic properties of Verma supermodules over regular symmetrizable Kac--Moody Lie superalgebras, exhibiting $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$-nature as revealed through changing Borel subalgebras.
We investigate variants of Verma modules obtained by changing Borel subalgebras, which enable us to realize the principal block of $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ as an extension-closed abelian subcategory of category $\mathcal{O}$. This phenomenon is precisely formulated in terms of semibricks.
On the other hand, by applying the exchange property of odd reflections, we describe compositions of homomorphisms between Verma modules associated with different Borel subalgebras that share the same character. As an application, we refine existing results on the associated varieties and projective dimensions of Verma modules.

A note on weight filtrations at the characteristic
Toni Annala, Piotr Pstrągowski
Comments:
23 pages. Comments are welcome!
Subjects:
K-Theory and Homology (math.KT); Algebraic Geometry (math.AG); Number Theory (math.NT)
We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$.
On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the décalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes.
Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification.
In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.

Stein's unbiased risk estimate and Hyvärinen's score matching
Sulagna Ghosh, Nikolaos Ignatiadis, Frederic Koehler, Amber Lee
Subjects:
Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Given a collection of observed signals corrupted with Gaussian noise, how can we learn to optimally denoise them? This fundamental problem arises in both empirical Bayes and generative modeling. In empirical Bayes, the predominant approach is via nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE), while in generative modeling, score matching (SM) methods have proven very successful. In our setting, Hyvärinen's implicit SM is equivalent to another classical idea from statistics -- Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). Revisiting SURE minimization, we establish, for the first time, that SURE achieves nearly parametric rates of convergence of the regret in the classical empirical Bayes setting with homoscedastic noise. We also prove that SURE-training can achieve fast rates of convergence to the oracle denoiser in a commonly studied misspecified model. In contrast, the NPMLE may not even converge to the oracle denoiser under misspecification of the class of signal distributions. We show how to practically implement our method in settings involving heteroscedasticity and side-information, such as in an application to the estimation of economic mobility in the Opportunity Atlas. Our empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of SURE-training over NPMLE under misspecification. Collectively, our findings advance SURE/SM as a strong alternative to the NPMLE for empirical Bayes problems in both theory and practice.

Global solutions for supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical wing with a shock wave detached from the leading edges
Bingsong Long
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
In this paper, we first investigate the mathematical aspects of supersonic flow of a Chaplygin gas past a conical wing with diamond-shaped cross sections in the case of a shock wave detached from the leading edges. The flow under consideration is governed by the three-dimensional steady compressible Euler equations. Mathematically, this problem can be reformulated as an oblique derivative problem for a nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation in conical coordinates. By establishing a Lipschitz estimate, we show that the equation is uniformly elliptic in any subdomain strictly away from the degenerate boundary. Using this property, we further prove the existence of a solution to the problem via the continuity method and vanishing viscosity method.

We show that when $p$ is an odd prime, $K$ is an unramified finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ and $G$ is a pure inner form of an unramified special orthogonal group or unitary group over $K$, the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence for $G$ agrees with the semi-simplification of classical local Langlands correspondence. As applications, we construct an unambiguous local Langlands correspondence for even orthogonal groups, deduce Fargues' eigen-sheaf conjecture, and prove new torsion vanishing results for orthogonal and unitary Shimura varieties.

A deep learning approach to inverse medium scattering: Learning regularizers from a direct imaging method
Kai Li, Bo Zhang, Haiwen Zhang
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
This paper aims to solve numerically the two-dimensional inverse medium scattering problem with far-field data. This is a challenging task due to the severe ill-posedness and strong nonlinearity of the inverse problem. As already known, it is necessary but also difficult numerically to employ an appropriate regularization strategy which effectively incorporates certain a priori information of the unknown scatterer to overcome the severe ill-posedness of the inverse problem. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning approach to learn the a priori information of the support of the unknown scatterer from a direct imaging method. Based on the learned a priori information, we propose two inversion algorithms for solving the inverse problem. In the first one, the learned a priori information is incorporated into the projected Landweber method. In the second one, the learned a priori information is used to design the regularization functional for the regularized variational formulation of the inverse problem which is then solved with a traditional iteration algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments show that our inversion algorithms provide good reconstruction results even for the high contrast case and have a satisfactory generalization ability.

Advances on the Packing Coloring Conjectures of Subcubic Graphs
Ayman El Zein, Maidoun Mortada
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
For a non-decreasing sequence of integers $S=(s_1,s_2, \dots, s_k)$, an $S$-packing coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k$ such that the distance between any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V_i$ is at least $s_{i}+1$, $1\leq i\leq k$. The packing chromatic number $\chi_{\rho}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest integer $p$ such that $G$ is $(1,2,\dots ,p)$-packing colorable. Gastineau and Togni asked whether the subdivision $S(G)$ of every subcubic graph $G$ has $\chi_{\rho}(S(G))\leq 5$ and whether every subcubic graph, except the Petersen graph, is $(1,1,2,2)$-packing colorable; these questions were later conjectured by Brešar et al. Moreover, Gastineau and Togni proved that a positive answer to the second question implies a positive answer to the first. In this paper, we completely resolve the second question for connected non-regular subcubic graphs, proving that they are $(1,1,2,2)$-packing colorable and hence satisfy $\chi_{\rho}(S(G)) \leq 5$. We also establish the same result for several classes of cubic graphs, including those with diamonds, certain cut-vertices, and bridges on short cycles. Finally, we strengthen the recent result of Liu, Zhang, and Zhang [\textit{Discrete Math.} 348 (11) (2025). 114610] that every subcubic graph is $(1,1,2,2,3)$-packing colorable by proving that every connected cubic graph admits a $(1,1,2,2,k)$-packing coloring in which at most one vertex receives color $k$, where $k$ is arbitrary. This not only simplifies the existing argument but also strictly improves the bound.

We introduce and study subalgebra cotype zeta functions, multivariate zeta functions enumerating fixed-index subalgebras of $R$-algebras of a given cotype. This generalizes and unifies previous works on subalgebra zeta functions and cotype zeta functions of $R$-algebras. We prove the local functional equations for the generic Euler factors of these zeta functions, and give an explicit formula for the subalgebra cotype zeta function of a general $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra $L$ of rank 3. We also give an asymptotic formula for the number of subalgebras $\Lambda$ of $L$ of index at most $X$ for which $L/\Lambda$ has rank at most, answering a question of Chinta, Kaplan, and Koplewitz. In particular, we show that unlike $\mathbb{Z}^3$, $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebras of rank 3 with additional multiplication structure exhibit different distribution of cocyclic subalgebras.

Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra subject to certain conditions. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist. The structure of braces emerges naturally in this context by requiring the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra to be a Hopf algebra and a quasi-triangular bialgebra after twisting. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar set-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then apply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra and we also obtain its twisted version.

Functoriality of Enriched Data Types

Comments:

Subjects:
Category Theory (math.CT); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)
In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions.

Subjects:

We consider eigenvalues of the Casimir operator on the naturally defined \textit{stable sequences} of representations of $su(N)$ algebra and prove that eigenvalues are linear over $N$ iff $\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+...+k\lambda_k=\lambda_{N-1}+2\lambda_{N-2}+...+k\lambda_{N-k}$, where $\lambda_i$ are Dynkin labels, and $\lambda_i=0$ for $k<i<N-k$, with fixed $k$. These representations are exactly those which appear in the decomposition of $ad(su(N))^{\otimes k}$, therefore this linearity admits the presentation of eigenvalues in the universal, in Vogel's sense, form, and supports the hypothesis of universal decomposition of $ad^{\otimes k}$ into Casimir eigenspaces.

We establish the endoscopic character identity for bounded $A$-packets of non-quasi-split even special orthogonal groups, with respect to elliptic endoscopic triples. The proof reduces the non-quasi-split case to the quasi-split case and the real Adam--Johnson case by combining local-global compatibility principle with Arthur's multiplicity formula for non-quasi-split even special orthogonal groups established by Chen and Zou in arXiv:2103.07956. This result plays a key role in the author's work arXiv:2503.04623 on the compatibility between the Fargues--Scholze local Langlands correspondence and classical local Langlands correspondence for even special orthogonal groups.

Logic (math.LO)
The degree of Kripke-incompleteness of a logic $L$ in some lattice $\mathcal{L}$ of logics is the cardinality of logics in $\mathcal{L}$ which share the same class of Kripke-frames with $L$. A celebrated result on Kripke-incompleteness is Blok's dichotomy theorem for the degree of Kripke-incompleteness in $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$: every modal logic $L\in\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$ is of the degree of Kripke-incompleteness $1$ or $2^{\aleph_0}$. In this work, we show that the dichotomy theorem for $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$ can be generalized to the lattices $\K$, $\LT$ and $\NExt(\ST)$ of tense logics. We also prove that in $\K$, $\LT$ and $\NExt(\ST)$, iterated splittings are exactly the strictly Kripke-complete logics.

Within both wholesale and retail market participation models, the economic benefit of the RCDC operation is maximized.

It is known that many modal and superintuitionistic logics are PSPACE-hard in languages with a small number of variables; however, questions about the complexity of similar fragments of many logics obtained by adding various axioms to "standard" ones remain unexplored. We investigate the complexity of fragments of modal logics obtained by adding an axiom requiring the convergence of the accessibility relation in Kripke frames: S4.2, K4.2, Grz.2, and GL.2. The main result is that S4.2 and Grz.2 are PSPACE-complete in a language with two variables, while K4.2 and GL.2* (a logic near to GL.2) are PSPACE-complete in a language with one variable. The obtained results are extended to infinite classes of logics.

The Erdős-Mollin-Walsh conjecture, asserting the nonexistence of three consecutive powerful integers, remains a celebrated open problem in number theory. A natural line of inquiry, following recent work by Chan (2025), is to investigate potential counterexamples centered around perfect cubes, which are themselves powerful. This paper establishes a new non-existence result for a family of such integer triplets with distinct structural constraints, combining techniques from modular arithmetic, $p$-adic valuation, Thue equations, and the theory of elliptic curves.

Suppose L and M are full-rank lattices in Euclidean space, such that vol(L) < vol(M). Answering a question of Han and Wang from 2001, we show how to construct a bounded measurable set F (we can even take F to be a finite union of polytopes) such that F+L is a tiling and F+M is a packing. If we do not require measurability of F it is often possible that a set F can be found tiling with both L and M even when L and M have different volumes, for instance if their intersection is trivial. We also show here that such a set can never be bounded if L and M have different volumes.

The BRIDGES meeting in gauge theory, extremal structures, and stability was held June 2024 at l'Institut d'Études Scientifiques de Cargèse in Corsica, organized by Daniele Faenzi, Eveline Legendre, Eric Loubeau, and Henrique Sá Earp. The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but related lecture series by Oscar García Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent Manivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the lecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on "Flows of geometric structures, especially $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures". Some assistance in the preparation of these notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer school. See the Comments field for more information.
The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric flows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows of such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows, and consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci flow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of geometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and survey several different geometric flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In particular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Laplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude with a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and Gianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit STE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.

Let $G_n$ denote the $n^{\rm th}$ Gleason polynomial, whose roots correspond to parameters $c$ such that the critical point $0$ is periodic of exact period $n$ under iteration of $z^2 + c$, and let $\bar{G}_n$ denote the reduction of $G_n$ modulo $2$. Buff, Floyd, Koch, and Parry made the surprising observation that the number of real roots of $G_n$ is equal to the number of irreducible factors of $\bar{G}_n$ for all $n$. We provide a bijective proof for this result by first providing explicit bijections between (a) the set of real roots of $G_n$ and the set $\bar{N}(n)$ of equivalence classes of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ under the inversion map swapping $0$ and $1$; and (b) the set of irreducible factors of $G_n$ modulo 2 and the set $\tilde{N}^+(n)$ of binary necklaces which are either primitive of length $n$ with an even number of $1$'s or primitive of length $n/2$ with an odd number of $1$'s. We then provide an explicit bijection, closely related to Milnor and Thurston's kneading theory, between $\bar{N}(n)$ and $\tilde{N}^+(n)$. In addition, we provide explicit bijections between $\bar{N}(n)$, the set ${\rm CUP}(n)$ of cyclic unimodal permutations of $\{ 1,\ldots,n \}$, and the set $N^-(n)$ of primitive binary necklaces of length $n$ with an odd number of $1$'s.

In this research we continue our previous investigation of wreath product normal structure \cite{SkuESL}. We generalize the group of unimodular matrices \cite{Amit} and find its structure. For this goal we propose one extension of the special linear group. Groups generated by three involutions, two of which are permutable, have long been of interest in the theory of matrix groups \cite{Maz}, for instance such generating set was researched for $S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{Z}+ i\mathbb{Z}}})$. But for size of matrix 3 on 3 this is imposable for some groups. We research this question for $ES{{L}_{3}}({\mathbb{Z}})$. An analytical formula of root in $SL(3, \mathbb{Z}$) is found, recursive formula for $n$-th power root in $SL(2, \mathbb{Z}$) is found too.

Zero-free sector of the Wronski map on the totally nonnegative Grassmannian

A classical result states that if $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$ with nonnegative coefficients, then $f(z)$ has no zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| < \frac{\pi}{n}$ of the complex plane, and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Motivated by the Shapiro--Shapiro conjecture and related problems in real Schubert calculus, we generalize this result to Wronskians of polynomials. Namely, let $f_1(z), \dots, f_k(z)$ be linearly independent polynomials of degree at most $n$ whose coefficient matrix has all nonnegative $k\times k$ minors (that is, the polynomials span an element of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian in the sense of Lusztig and Postnikov). We show that the Wronskian polynomial $\operatorname{Wr}(f_1, \dots, f_k)$ has no complex zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| < \frac{\pi}{n}$ (independent of $k$), and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Our proof uses classical results of Gantmakher and Krein (1950) and Obreschkoff (1923) on sign variation.

The closed unit bidisc $\overline{\mathbb{D}}^2$ is known to be a spectral set for any pair $(T_1,T_2)$ of commuting contractions. When each $T_i$ is pure and has finite defect, the pair admits a much smaller spectral set: the closure of a distinguished variety $V$ inside the bidisc $\mathbb{D}^2$. We find conditions on $(T_1,T_2)$ that guarantee that the closure of $V$ is a minimal spectral set. In addition, we examine the relationship between $V$ and the annihilating ideal $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$ in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D}^2)$. While $V$ is typically strictly larger than the zero set of $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$, we isolate a natural constrained isometric co-extension $(S_1,S_2)$ of $(T_1,T_2)$ whose Taylor spectrum is contained in $V$ and is closely linked to the so-called support of $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$. We also characterize when $\text{Ann}(T_1,T_2)$ is the ideal of functions vanishing on the joint point spectrum of $(S_1^*,S_2^*)$.

Vertex-Based Localization of Generalized Turán Problems
Rajat Adak, L. Sunil Chandran
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO); Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$. Generalized Turán problems aim to maximize the number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph. This maximum is denoted by $ex(n, H, \mathcal{F})$. When $H \cong K_2$, it is simply denoted by $ex(n,F)$. Erdős and Gallai established the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo \cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n}{k} \binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{n-1}{k-1} \binom{k}{s}$. Let $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we use the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in \cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\choose s} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{v \in V(G)}{p(v) \choose s-1}\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \choose s}\right) - \frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \choose s}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality for these bounds. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s \geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in \cite{adak2025vertex}. We also conclude with a generalization of a result by Balister-Bollobás-Riordan-Schelp \cite{BALISTER2003366}.

Density Characterization with The Upper Bound of Density of Fibonacci Word
Duaa Abdullah, Jasem Hamoud
Comments:
13 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Comments welcome!
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
This paper investigates the natural density and structural relationships within Fibonacci words, the density of a Fibonacci word is $\operatorname{DF}(F_k)=n/(n+m),$ where $m$ denote the number of zeros in a Fibonacci word and $n$ denote the units digit. Through analysis of these ratios and their convergence to powers of $\varphi$, we illustrate the intrinsic exponential growth rates characteristic of Fibonacci words. By considering the natural density concept for sets of positive integers, it is demonstrated that the density of Fibonacci words approaches unity, correlating with classical results on Fibonacci number distributions as \[ \operatorname{DF}(F_k) <\frac{m(m+1)}{n(2m-n+1)}. \] Furthermore, generating functions and combinatorial formulas for general terms of Fibonacci words are derived, linking polynomial expressions and limit behaviors integral to their combinatorial structure. The study is supplemented by numerical data and graphical visualization, confirming theoretical findings and providing insights into the early transient and asymptotic behavior of Fibonacci word densities.

Arithmetic progressions of primes in short intervals beyond the 17/30 barrier
Le Duc Hieu
Comments:

Subjects:
Number Theory (math.NT)
We show that once $\theta>17/30$, every sufficiently long interval $[x,x+x^\theta]$ contains many $k$-term arithmetic progressions of primes, uniformly in the starting point $x$. More precisely, for each fixed $k\ge3$ and $\theta>17/30$, for all sufficiently large $X$ and all $x\in[X,2X]$, \[ \#\{\text{$k$-APs of primes in }[x,x+x^\theta]\}\ \gg_{k,\theta}\ \frac{N^{2}}{\big((\varphi(W)/W)^{k}(\log R)^{k}\big)}\ \asymp\ \frac{X^{2\theta}}{(\log X)^{k+1+o(1)}}, \] where $W:=\prod_{p\le \tfrac12\log\log X}p$, $N:=\lfloor x^\theta/W\rfloor$, and $R:=N^\eta$ for a small fixed $\eta=\eta(k,\theta)>0$. This is obtained by combining the uniform short-interval prime number theorem at exponents $\theta>17/30$ (a consequence of recent zero-density estimates of Guth and Maynard) with the Green-Tao transference principle (in the relative Szemerédi form) on a window-aligned $W$-tricked block. We also record a concise Maynard-type lemma on dense clusters \emph{restricted to a fixed congruence class} in tiny intervals $(\log x)^\varepsilon$, which we use as a warm-up and for context. An appendix contains a short-interval Barban-Davenport-Halberstam mean square bound (uniform in $x$) that we use as a black box for variance estimates. The proofs in this paper were assisted by GPT-5.

Chebyshev smoothing with adaptive block-FSAI preconditioners for the multilevel solution of higher-order problems

Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
In this paper, we assess the performance of adaptive and nested factorized sparse approximate inverses as smoothers in multilevel V-cycles, when smoothing is performed following the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind. For our test problems, we rely on the partition of unity method to discretize the biharmonic and triharmonic equations in a multilevel manner. Inspired by existing algorithms, we introduce a new adaptive algorithm for the construction of sparse approximate inverses, based on the block structure of matrices arising in the partition of unity method. Additionally, we also present a new (and arguably simpler) formulation of the Chebyshev iteration of the fourth kind.

The bilinear form u^\top f(A) v of matrix functions appears in many application problems, where u, v \in R^n\), A \in R^{n * n}\), and f(z) is a given analytic this http URL IDR(s) method effectively reduces computational complexity and storage requirements by introducing dimension reduction techniques, while maintaining the numerical stability of the algorithm. This paper studies the numerical algorithm and posterior error estimation for the matrix function bilinear form u^{\top} f(A) v based on the IDR(s) method. Through the error analysis of the IDR(s) algorithm, the corresponding error expansion is derived, and it is verified that the leading term of the error expansion serves as a reliable posterior error estimate. Based on this, in this paper a corresponding stopping criterion is proposed. This approach is dedicated to improving computational efficiency, especially by showing excellent performance in handling ill-posed and large-scale problems.

Lipschitz regularity for $p$-harmonic interface transmission problems

The manuscript contains an error in the proof Lemma 7 that is not fixable. More precisely, in the Young estimate on p. 13 line 8, $\varepsilon^{p-1}$ must be replaced by $\varepsilon^{1/(p-1)}$.

We prove optimal Lipschitz regularity for weak solutions of the measure-valued $p$-Poisson equation $-\Delta_p u = Q \; \mathcal{H}^{n-1} \llcorner \Gamma$. Here $p \in (1,2)$, $\Gamma$ is a compact and connected $C^2$-hypersurface without boundary, and $Q$ is a positive $W^{2,\infty}$-density. This equation can be understood as a nonlinear interface transmission problem. Our main result extends previous studies of the linear case and provides further insights on a delicate limit case of (linear and nonlinear) potential theory.

Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)
We establish \textit{sharp} bilinear and multilinear eigenfunction estimates for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the standard three-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, eliminating the logarithmic loss that has persisted in the literature since the pioneering work of Burq, Gérard, and Tzvetkov over twenty years ago. This completes the theory of multilinear eigenfunction estimates on the standard spheres. Our approach relies on viewing $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the compact Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and exploiting its representation theory, especially the properties of \mbox{Clebsch-Gordan} coefficients.
Motivated by applications to the energy-critical nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we also prove a refined Strichartz estimate of mixed-norm type $L^\infty_{x_2}L^4_{t,x_1}$ on the cylindrical space $\mathbb{R}_{x_1} \times \mathbb{T}_{x_2}$, adapted to certain spectrally localized functions. The argument relies on a combination of precise measure estimates and a novel \textit{kernel decomposition method}. As an additional application, this method can be used to establish the \textit{sharp} $L^4$-Strichartz estimate for the hyperbolic Schrödinger equation on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$.
Combining these two key ingredients, we derive a refined bilinear Strichartz estimate on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, which in turn yields small-data global well-posedness for the above mentioned NLS in the energy space.

On the verification of a Nicolas inequality

Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x < \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the sign of such an error term.

The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
A random variable X is strictly stable if a sum of independent copies of X has the same distribution as X up to scaling, and is stable (in the broad sense) if the sum has the same distribution as X up to both scaling and shifting. Steutel and Van Harn studied 'discrete strict stability' for random variables taking values in the non-negative integers, replacing scaling by the thinning operation. We extend this to 'discrete stability' (in the broad sense), where shifting is replaced by the addition of an independent Poisson random variable. The discrete stable distributions are 'Poisson-delayed Sibuya' distributions, which include the Poisson and Hermite distributions. Similar results have been proved independently by Townes (arXiv:2509.05497).

We prove that the spectral selectors introduced by the author for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds satisfy algebraic properties analogous to those of the spectral selectors for lens spaces constructed by Allais, Sandon and the author using Givental's nonlinear Maslov index. As applications, first we establish a contact big fiber theorem for closed strongly orderable contact manifolds as well as for lens spaces. Second, when the Reeb flow is periodic, we construct a stably unbounded conjugation invariant norm on the contactomorphism group universal cover. Moreover, when all its orbits have the same period, we show that the Reeb flow is a geodesic for the discriminant and oscillation norms of Colin-Sandon. Finally, we generalize a theorem of Albers-Fuchs-Merry stating that non-orderability implies the Weinstein conjecture.

Spanning Factorizations in Vertex-Transitive Digraphs of Degree 2
Vance Faber
Comments:
No figures
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
We investigate the existence of spanning 1-factorizations in vertex-transitive digraphs of out-degree d. The open question is whether every such digraph admits a spanning 1-factorization that includes, for each vertex v, all d out-edges (v,F_i(v)) from v.
This paper focuses on the case d=2. Using the structure of alternating cycles and block systems, we develop a block/phase framework that yields sufficient conditions for including both F_1,F_2. We show that certain block obstructions can prevent their simultaneous inclusion, while sharply transitive sets (and hence spanning 1-factorizations) always exist. Our results provide general constraints on feasible block sizes, describe the role of phase distributions, and illustrate the theory with concrete families, including coset digraphs on A_5. The necessity of the block criterion remains open, even in degree 2.

Anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators

Comments:

Subjects:
Rings and Algebras (math.RA)
In this paper, we first introduce the notion of an anti-pre-Poisson bialgebra, which is shown to be equivalent to both quadratic anti-pre-Poisson algebras and matched pairs of Poisson algebras. The study of coboundary anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras leads to the anti-pre-Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (APP-YBE). Skew-symmetric solutions of this equation give rise to coboundary anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras. Furthermore, we investigate how solutions without skew-symmetry can also induce such bialgebras, prompting the introduction of quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras. In particular, solutions of the APP-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant induce a quasi-triangular anti-pre-Poisson bialgebra. Such solutions are also interpreted as relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights. Finally, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-pre-Poisson algebras and factorizable anti-pre-Poisson bialgebras.

Introducing the method of ellipcenters, a new first order technique for unconstrained optimization
Roger Behling, Ramyro Aquines Correa, Eduarda Ferreira Zanatta, Vincent Guigues
Subjects:
Optimization and Control (math.OC)
In this paper, we introduce the Method of Ellipcenters (ME) for unconstrained minimization. At the cost of two gradients per iteration and a line search, we compute the next iterate by setting it as the center of an elliptical interpolation. The idea behind the ellipse built in each step is to emulate the original level curve of the objective function constrained to a suitable two-dimensional affine space, which is determined by the current iterate and two appropriate gradient vectors. We present the method for general unconstrained minimization and carry out a convergence analysis for the case where the objective function is quadratic. In this context, ME enjoys linear convergence with the rate being at least as good as the linear rate of the steepest descent (gradient) method with optimal step. In our experiments, however, ME was much faster than the gradient method with optimal step size. Moreover, ME seems highly competitive in comparison to several well established algorithms, including Nesterov's accelerated gradient, Barzilai-Borwein, and conjugate gradient. The efficiency in terms of both time and number of iterations is stressed even more for ill-conditioned problems. A theoretical feature that might be a reason for this is that ME coincides with Newton for quadratic programs in two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, solving them in one single step. In our numerical tests, convergence in one iteration only was also observed for much larger problem sizes.

Also, we find that normal-$m$-isometry and normal quasi-$m$-isometry weighted composition operators have finite spectrum. Consequently we have the results for composition and multiplication operators. In addition, we prove that for $m\geq 2$, a multiplication operator is $m$-isometry (quasi-$m$-isometry) if and only if it is $2$-isometry (quasi-$2$-isometry). Some examples are provided to illustrate our results.

On certain integral functionals of integer-valued subordinators

Comments:
36 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures
Subjects:
Probability (math.PR)
It is known that the exponential functional of a Poisson process admits a probability density function in the form of an infinite series. In this paper, we obtain an explicit expression for the density function of the exponential functional of any integer-valued subordinator, and by extension, limit representations for that of an arbitrary pure-jump subordinator. With an added positive drift, the density function is expressed via piecewise basis functions governed by a functional relation. Closed-form density functions for these cases have been established only for a few special instances of Lévy processes in the past literature. Our work substantially advances this line of research by providing an analytical perspective on the distribution of a broad class of exponential Lévy functionals, also suggesting potential methodological extensions to general purely discontinuous Lévy processes. Moreover, we consider arbitrary decreasing functionals of integer-valued subordinators by deriving sufficient and necessary conditions for their convergence, which are then applied to obtain limit-series representations for the density functions of inverse-power functionals. The numerical performance of the proposed formulae is demonstrated through various examples of well-known distributions.

Infinite Euclidean Distance Discriminants

We study infinite Euclidean distance discriminants of algebraic varieties, defined as the loci of data points whose fibers under the second projection from the Euclidean distance correspondence are positive-dimensional. In particular, these discriminants contain all data points with infinitely many critical points for the nearest-point problem. We present computer code that computes the infinite Euclidean distance discriminant, and use it to present numerous varieties with nonempty such discriminants. Moreover, we prove that for any data point, the fiber under the second projection is contained in a finite union of hyperspheres centered at that point. For curves, we include a complete characterization; their infinite Euclidean distance discriminants turn out to be affine linear spaces. Finally, we introduce and characterize skew-tube surfaces in three-dimensional space. By construction, these have a one-dimensional infinite Euclidean distance discriminant. We further demonstrate that many skew-tubes have significantly lower Euclidean distance degrees than generic surfaces of the same degree.

Quantum algorithms for time-fractional equations
Subjects:
Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We develop a quantum algorithm for solving high-dimensional time-fractional heat equations. By applying the dimension extension technique from [FKW23], the $d+1$-dimensional time-fractional equation is reformulated as a local partial differential equation in $d+2$ dimensions. Through discretization along both the extended and spatial domains, a stable system of ordinary differential equations is obtained by a simple change of variables. We propose a quantum algorithm for the resulting semi-discrete problem using the Schrodingerization approach from [JLY24a,JLY23,JL24a]. The Schrodingerization technique transforms general linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schrodinger-type systems--with unitary evolution, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This is accomplished via the warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. We provide detailed implementations of this method and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis, demonstrating up to exponential advantage--with respect to the inverse of the mesh size in high dimensions~--~compared to its classical counterparts. Specifically, to compute the solution to time $T$, while the classical method requires at least $\mathcal{O}(N_t d h^{-(d+0.5)})$ matrix-vector multiplications, where $N_t $ is the number of time steps (which is, for example, $\mathcal{O}(Tdh^{-2})$ for the forward Euler method), our quantum algorithms requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^2d^4 h^{-8})$ queries to the block-encoding input models, with the quantum complexity being independent of the dimension $d$ in terms of the inverse mesh size $h^{-1}$. Numerical experiments are performed to validate our formulation.

We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|>N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.

Title:
A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant
Dror Bar-Natan, Roland van der Veen
Comments:
34 pages
Subjects:
Geometric Topology (math.GT); Quantum Algebra (math.QA)
In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
* Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
* Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
* Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
* Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
$\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta$ is almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.

Title:
Perfect Divisibility and Coloring of Some Bull-Free Graphs
Ran Chen, Di Wu, Junran Yu, Xiaowen Zhang
Subjects:
Combinatorics (math.CO)
A graph $G$ is {\em perfectly divisible} if, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])<\omega(H)$. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edge, a {\em fork } is a graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing an edge once, and an {\em odd torch} is a graph obtained from an odd hole by adding an edge $xy$ such that $x$ is nonadjacent to any vertex on the odd hole and the set of neighbors of $y$ on the odd hole is a stable set.
Chudnovsky and Sivaraman [J. Graph Theory 90 (2019) 54-60] proved that every (odd hole, bull)-free graph and every ($P_5$, bull)-free graph are perfectly divisible. Karthick {\em et al.} [The Electron. J. of Combin. 29 (2022) P3.19.] proved that every (fork, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Chen and Xu [Discrete Appl. Math. 372 (2025) 298-307.] proved that every ($P_7,C_5$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. Let $H\in$\{\{odd~torch\}, $\{P_8,C_5\}\}$. In this paper, we prove that every ($H$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible. We also prove that a ($P_6$, bull)-free graph is perfectly divisible if and only if it contains no Mycielski-Grötzsch graph as an induced subgraph. As corollaries, these graphs is $\binom{\omega+1}{2}$-colorable. Notice that every odd torch contains an odd hole, a $P_5$, and a fork. Therefore, our results generalize the results of these scholars. Moreover, we prove that every ($P_6$, bull)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\omega(G)^7$.

This paper is concerned with the stability and large-time behavior for 3D magneto-micropolar equations with horizontal dissipation. The global well-posedness of the aforementioned system is established, with the initial data and its vertical derivatives required to be sufficiently small in $L^2$ space. Moreover, we obtain the optimal decay rates for the $H^1$-norm of the solution. The proofs of our main results rely on the special structure of the equations and anisotropic Sobolev-type inequalities.

We develop Bayesian predictive stacking for geostatistical models, where the primary inferential objective is to provide inference on the latent spatial random field and conduct spatial predictions at arbitrary locations. We exploit analytically tractable posterior distributions for regression coefficients of predictors and the realizations of the spatial process conditional upon process parameters. We subsequently combine such inference by stacking these models across the range of values of the hyper-parameters. We devise stacking of means and posterior densities in a manner that is computationally efficient without resorting to iterative algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and can exploit the benefits of parallel computations. We offer novel theoretical insights into the resulting inference within an infill asymptotic paradigm and through empirical results showing that stacked inference is comparable to full sampling-based Bayesian inference at a significantly lower computational cost.

The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.

We study webs of 5-branes with 7-branes in Type IIB string theory from a geometric perspective. Mathematically, a web of 5-branes with 7-branes is a tropical curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with focus-focus singularities introduced. To any such a web $W$, we attach a log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with a line bundle $L$. We then describe supersymmetric webs, which are webs defining 5d superconformal field theories (SCFTs), in terms of the geometry of $(Y,D,L)$. We also introduce particular supersymmetric webs called ``consistent webs", and show that any 5d SCFT defined by a supersymmetric web can be obtained from a consistent web by adding free hypermultiplets. Using birational geometry of degenerations of log Calabi-Yau surfaces, we provide an algorithm to test the consistency of a web in terms of its dual polygon. Moreover, for a consistent web $W$, we provide an algebro-geometric construction of the mirror $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ to $(Y,D,L)$, as a non-toric canonical 3-fold singularity, and show that M-theory on $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ engineers the same 5d SCFT as $W$. We also explain how to derive explicit equations for $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ using scattering diagrams, encoding disk worldsheet instantons in the A-model, or equivalently the BPS states of an auxiliary rank one 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.

The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.

Sparse Max-Affine Regression

Subjects:

This paper presents Sparse Gradient Descent as a solution for variable selection in convex piecewise linear regression, where the model is given as the maximum of $k$-affine functions $ x \mapsto \max_{j \in [k]} \langle a_j^\star, x \rangle + b_j^\star$ for $j = 1,\dots,k$. Here, $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ and $\{b_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$ denote the ground-truth weight vectors and intercepts. A non-asymptotic local convergence analysis is provided for Sp-GD under sub-Gaussian noise when the covariate distribution satisfies the sub-Gaussianity and anti-concentration properties. When the model order and parameters are fixed, Sp-GD provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\max(\epsilon^{-2}\sigma_z^2,1)s\log(d/s))$ observations where $\sigma_z^2$ denotes the noise variance. This also implies the exact parameter recovery by Sp-GD from $\mathcal{O}(s\log(d/s))$ noise-free observations. The proposed initialization scheme uses sparse principal component analysis to estimate the subspace spanned by $\{ a_j^\star\}_{j=1}^k$, then applies an $r$-covering search to estimate the model parameters. A non-asymptotic analysis is presented for this initialization scheme when the covariates and noise samples follow Gaussian distributions. When the model order and parameters are fixed, this initialization scheme provides an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate given $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}\max(\sigma_z^4,\sigma_z^2,1)s^2\log^4(d))$ observations. A new transformation named Real Maslov Dequantization (RMD) is proposed to transform sparse generalized polynomials into sparse max-affine models. The error decay rate of RMD is shown to be exponentially small in its temperature parameter. Furthermore, theoretical guarantees for Sp-GD are extended to the bounded noise model induced by RMD. Numerical Monte Carlo results corroborate theoretical findings for Sp-GD and the initialization scheme.

Wrapped Gaussian on the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices

Circular and non-flat data distributions are prevalent across diverse domains of data science, yet their specific geometric structures often remain underutilized in machine learning frameworks. A principled approach to accounting for the underlying geometry of such data is pivotal, particularly when extending statistical models, like the pervasive Gaussian distribution. In this work, we tackle those issue by focusing on the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, a key focus in information geometry. We introduce a non-isotropic wrapped Gaussian by leveraging the exponential map, we derive theoretical properties of this distribution and propose a maximum likelihood framework for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we reinterpret established classifiers on SPD through a probabilistic lens and introduce new classifiers based on the wrapped Gaussian model. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of this geometry-aware distribution, underscoring its potential to advance manifold-based data analysis. This work lays the groundwork for extending classical machine learning and statistical methods to more complex and structured data.

Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Information Theory (cs.IT)
Neuromorphic Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a theoretical approach to designing better user experiences (UX) motivated by advances in the understanding of the neurophysiology of the brain. Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.

Enhanced uncertainty quantification variational autoencoders for the solution of Bayesian inverse problems

Comments:

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
Among other uses, neural networks are a powerful tool for solving deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems in real-time, where variational autoencoders, a specialized type of neural network, enable the Bayesian estimation of model parameters and their distribution from observational data allowing real-time inverse uncertainty quantification. In this work, we build upon existing research [Goh, H. et al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2022] by proposing a novel loss function to train variational autoencoders for Bayesian inverse problems. When the forward map is affine, we provide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the latent states of variational autoencoders to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We validate this theoretical result through numerical tests and we compare the proposed variational autoencoder with the existing one in the literature both in terms of accuracy and generalization properties. Finally, we test the proposed variational autoencoder on a Laplace equation, with comparison to the original one and Markov Chains Monte Carlo.

Two-sample hypothesis testing-determining whether two sets of data are drawn from the same distribution-is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with broad scientific applications. In the context of nonparametric testing, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has gained popularity as a test statistic due to its flexibility and strong theoretical foundations. However, its use in large-scale scenarios is plagued by high computational costs. In this work, we use a Nyström approximation of the MMD to design a computationally efficient and practical testing algorithm while preserving statistical guarantees. Our main result is a finite-sample bound on the power of the proposed test for distributions that are sufficiently separated with respect to the MMD. The derived separation rate matches the known minimax optimal rate in this setting. We support our findings with a series of numerical experiments, emphasizing applicability to realistic scientific data.

Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas

Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.

Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors

Comments:
4 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables

Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a new family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 4]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.

Consider a pair of sparse correlated stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n},\epsilon;s)$ subsampled from a common parent stochastic block model with two symmetric communities, average degree $\lambda=O(1)$, divergence parameter $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ and subsampling probability $s$. For all $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and $\Delta>0$, we construct a statistic based on the combination of two low-degree polynomials and show that there exists a sufficiently small constant $\delta=\delta(\epsilon,\lambda,\Delta)>0$ such that if $\epsilon^2 \lambda s>1+\Delta$ and $s>\sqrt{\alpha}-\delta$ where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is Otter's constant, this statistic can distinguish this model and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n},\epsilon)$ with probability $1-o(1)$. We also provide an efficient algorithm that approximates this statistic in polynomial time.
The crux of our statistic's construction lies in a carefully curated family of multigraphs called \emph{decorated trees}, which enables effective aggregation of the community signal and graph correlation by leveraging the counts of the same decorated tree while suppressing the undesirable correlations among counts of different decorated trees. We believe such construction may be of independent interest.

Subjects:

This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.

Publication Design with Incentives in Mind

Subjects:

The publication process both determines which research receives the most attention, and influences the supply of research through its impact on researchers' private incentives. We introduce a framework to study optimal publication decisions when researchers can choose (i) whether or how to conduct a study and (ii) whether or how to manipulate the research findings (e.g., via selective reporting or data manipulation). When manipulation is not possible, but research entails substantial private costs for the researchers, it may be optimal to incentivize cheaper research designs even if they are less accurate. When manipulation is possible, it is optimal to publish some manipulated results, as well as results that would have not received attention in the absence of manipulability. Even if it is possible to deter manipulation, such as by requiring pre-registered experiments instead of (potentially manipulable) observational studies, it is suboptimal to do so when experiments entail high research costs. We illustrate the implications of our model in an application to medical studies.

We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a 0-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed 4-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ -- to obtain an everywhere nondegenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is nonsingular, but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction, thus, shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.

Modeling Innovation Ecosystem Dynamics through Interacting Reinforced Bernoulli Processes
Giacomo Aletti, Irene Crimaldi, Andrea Ghiglietti, Federico Nutarelli
Subjects:
Applications (stat.AP); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
Understanding how capabilities evolve into core capabilities-and how core capabilities may ossify into rigidities-is central to innovation strategy (Leonard-Barton 1992, Teece 2009). A major challenge in formalizing this process lies in the interactive nature of innovation: successes in one domain often reshape others, endogenizing specialization and complicating isolated modeling. This is especially true in ecosystems where firm capabilities and innovation outcomes hinge on managing interdependencies and complementarities (Jacobides, Cennamo and Gawer 2018, 2024).
To address this, we propose a novel formal model based on interacting reinforced Bernoulli processes. This framework captures how patent successes propagate across technological categories and how these categories co-evolve. The model is able to jointly account for several stylized facts in the empirical innovation literature, including sublinear success growth (successprobability decay), convergence of success shares across fields, and diminishing cross-category correlations over time.
Empirical validation using GLOBAL PATSTAT (1980-2018) supports the theoretical predictions. We estimate the structural parameters of the interaction matrix and we also propose a statistical procedure to make inference on the intensity of cross-category interactions under the mean-field assumption.
By endogenizing technological specialization, our model provides a strategic tool for policymakers and managers, supporting decision-making in complex, co-evolving innovation ecosystems-where targeted interventions can produce systemic effects, influencing competitive trajectories and shaping long-term patterns of specialization.

This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While various methods have been proposed for this problem, they fail to reliably converge to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extension of the Riemannian Trust Region algorithm based on the probability-one homotopy optimization method, which enhances convergence to a global maximizer and, under certain conditions, ensures convergence to the global maximizer. In addition to the proposed method, existing state-of-the-art approaches are also presented, along with an explanation of their limitations and their connection to the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated alongside the state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, assessing convergence speed, success in reaching the global maximizer, and scalability with increasing problem dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its applicability.

Localization of strings on group manifolds

We compute the partition function of the WZW model with target a compact Lie group $G$ by adapting a method used by Choi and Takhtajan to compute the heat kernel of the group manifold. The basic idea is to compute the partition function of a supersymmetric version of the WZW model using a form of supersymmetric localization and then use the fact that, since the fermions of the supersymmetric WZW model are actually decoupled from the bosons, this also determines the partition function of the purely bosonic WZW model. The result is a formula for the partition function as a sum over contributions from abelian classical solutions. We verify for $G=SU(2)$ that this formula agrees with the result for the same partition function that comes from the Weyl-Kac character formula. We extend the method of supersymmetric localization to certain related models such as the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model and a Wick-rotated version of this model in which the target space is hyperbolic three-space $H_3^+$.

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation, requiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading information. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and advanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal errors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors with heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper proposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple simultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity monitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically exploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A tight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of hypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is examined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated based on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in existing research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical protection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than 50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings, baseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism induced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the proposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal operations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising potential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a decision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for multi-constellation GNSS applications.

Title:
Lines in Every Direction with No ee-Random Points

Computational Complexity (cs.CC); Probability (math.PR)
We prove that in every direction in the Euclidean plane, there exists a line containing no double exponential time random (ee-random) points. This means each point on these lines has an algorithmically predictable location, to the extent that a gambler in an environment with fair payouts can, using double exponential time computing resources, amass unbounded capital placing bets on increasingly precise estimates of the point's location. Our proof relies on effectivizing the construction of the lineal extension of a Kakeya set. This resolves an open question of Lutz and Lutz (2015).

Title:
Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent

Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $0<H<1$. Here we extend this definition to the regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The resulting process is both very rough and persistent, that is long-range positively correlated. In addition, this process is stationary. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also study another closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.

Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem

In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, the bound implies the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate, even in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.

Title:
Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras

A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.

Title:
A Generative Conditional Distribution Equality Testing Framework and Its Minimax Analysis
Siming Zheng, Meifang Lan, Tong Wang, Yuanyuan Lin
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
In this paper, we propose a general framework for testing the equality of the conditional distributions in a two-sample problem. This problem is most relevant to transfer learning under covariate shift. Our framework is built on neural network-based generative methods and sample splitting techniques by transforming the conditional distribution testing problem into an unconditional one. We introduce two special tests: the generative permutation-based conditional distribution equality test and the generative classification accuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. Theoretically, we establish a minimax lower bound for statistical inference in testing the equality of two conditional distributions under certain smoothness conditions. We demonstrate that the generative permutation-based conditional distribution equality test and its modified version can attain this lower bound precisely or up to some iterated logarithmic factor. Moreover, we prove the testing consistency of the generative classification accuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. We also establish the convergence rate for the learned conditional generator by deriving new results related to the recently-developed offset Rademacher complexity and approximation properties using neural networks. Empirically, we conduct numerical studies including synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
