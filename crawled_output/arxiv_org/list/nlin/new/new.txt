Title:
A game played by tandem-running ants: Hint of procedural rationality

Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\textit{Diacamma}$ $\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.

Title:
One- and two-dimensional solitons under the action of the inverted cubic-quintic nonlinearity

The usual cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity is proved to sustain one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) broad (flat-top) solitons. In this work, we demonstrate that 1D and 2D soliton families can be supported, in the semi-infinite bandgap (SIBG), by the interplay of a lattice potential and the nonlinearity including self-defocusing cubic and self-focusing quintic terms, with the sign combination inverted with respect to the usual CQ nonlinearity. The families include fundamental and dipole solitons in 1D, and fundamental, quadrupole, and vortex solitons in 2D. The power, shapes, and stability of the solitons are reported. The results are strongly affected by the positions of the solitons in SIBG, the families being unstable very close to or very far from the SIBG's edge. The inverted CQ nonlinearity, considered in this work, sustains sharp 1D and 2D stable solitons, which can be naturally used as bit pixels in photonic data-processing applications.

Title:
Integrable twelve-component nonlinear dynamical system on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice
Oleksiy O. Vakhnenko, Vyacheslav O. Vakhnenko
Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
Bearing in mind the potential physical applicability of multicomponent completely integrable nonlinear dynamical models on quasi-one-dimensional lattices we have developed the novel twelve-component and six-component semi-discrete nonlinear inregrable systems in the framework of semi-discrete Ablowitz--Kaup--Newell--Segur scheme. The set of lowest local conservation laws found by the generalized direct recurrent technique was shown to be indispensable constructive tool in the reduction procedure from the prototype to actual field variables. Two types of admissible symmetries for the twelve-component system and one type of symmetry for the six-component system have been established. The mathematical structure of total local current was shown to support the charge transportation only by four of six subsystems incorporated into the twelve-component system under study. The twelve-component system is able to model the actions of external parametric drive and external uniform magnetic field via time dependencies and phase factors of coupling parameters.

Title:
Bilinear Differential-Difference Equations and One-Point Distributions of Some KPZ-Class Models

Subjects:
Probability (math.PR); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We introduce a collection of nonlinear integrable partial differential-difference equations that are satisfied by the one-point distribution functions of some classical integrable KPZ models. Moreover, these equations can be regarded as reparametrizations or as scaling limits of the Hirota bilinear difference equation (HBDE), a canonical discretization for many important integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, and the two-dimensional Toda lattice (2DTL). Our contributions are threefold: (i) general Fredholm determinant solutions; (ii) verification that known formulas for classical integrable KPZ models fit within our framework; and (iii) zero-curvature/Lax pair formulations. As an application, we derive formal scaling limits of the equations, including the KP limit under 1:2:3 KPZ scaling.

In previous study [1], we proposed a new physical law applicable to both particle and thermodynamical systems. Additionally, we introduced a physical definition of chaos and self-organization. In the present work, we extend this novel interaction scheme to various thermodynamical systems in order to test the universality of the proposed law. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of these systems also exhibit chaotic behavior under different conditions. We discussed the relationship between chaotic dynamics and the least action, and for the first time, we proposed the "Chaotic Action Principle" (CAP). Furthermore, we examined the validity of the physical and philosophical foundations of this new law and the associated definition of chaos. Finally, based on CAP, we proposed a new conceptual definition of complexity.

Title:
Cycling and tensed cells interpenetrated by non-cycling and compressed cells form a critical epithelial reticulum

With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.

Title:
Criticality of a stochastic modern Hopfield network model with exponential interaction function
Marco Cafiso, Paolo Paradisi
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
The Hopfield network (HN) is a classical model of associative memory whose dynamics are closely related to the Ising spin system with 2-body interactions. Stored patterns are encoded as minima of an energy function shaped by a Hebbian learning rule, and retrieval corresponds to convergence towards these minima. Modern Hopfield Networks (MHNs) introduce p-body interactions among neurons with p greater than 2 and, more recently, also exponential interaction functions, which significantly improve network's storing and retrieval capacity. While the criticality of HNs and p-body MHNs were extensively studied since the 1980s, the investigation of critical behavior in exponential MHNs is still in its early stages. Here, we study a stochastic exponential MHN (SMHN) with a multiplicative salt-and-pepper noise. While taking the noise probability p as control parameter, the average overlap parameter Q and a diffusion scaling H are taken as order parameters. In particular, H is related to the time correlation features of the network, with H greater than 0.5 signaling the emergence of persistent time memory. We found the emergence of a critical transition in both Q and H, with the critical noise level weakly decreasing as the load N increases. Notably, for each load N, the diffusion scaling H highlights a transition between a sub- and a super-critical regime, both with short-range correlated dynamics. Conversely, the critical regime, which is found in the range of p around 0.23-0.3, displays a long-range correlated dynamics with highly persistent temporal memory marked by the high value H around 1.3.

Coarsening dynamics for spiral and nonspiral waves in active Potts models
Hiroshi Noguchi

Subjects:
Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
This study examines the domain-growth dynamics of $q$-state active Potts models ($q = 3$--$8$) under the cyclically symmetric conditions using Monte Carlo simulations on square and hexagonal lattices. By imposing active cyclic flipping of states, finite-length waves emerge in the long-term limit. This study focuses on coarsening dynamics from an initially random mixture of states to these moving-domain states. When spiral waves appear in the final state, the correlation length follows the Lifshitz--Allen--Cahn (LAC) law ($\propto t^{1/2}$) until saturation is observed at the characteristic wavelength. By contrast, in the case of nonspiral waves, the growth rate is raised prior to the saturation, leading to a transient increase in the coarsening exponent. Moreover, the mean cluster size exhibits a similar form of transient increase under most of the conditions. In factorized symmetry modes at $q=6$, domains composed of two or three states similarly follow the LAC law. Finally, this study confirmed that the choice of lattice type (square or hexagonal) and update scheme (Metropolis or Glauber) does not alter the dynamic behavior.

Title:
Equilibrium flow: From Snapshots to Dynamics
Yanbo Zhang, Michael Levin
Comments:
17 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
Scientific data, from cellular snapshots in biology to celestial distributions in cosmology, often consists of static patterns from underlying dynamical systems. These snapshots, while lacking temporal ordering, implicitly encode the processes that preserve them. This work investigates how strongly such a distribution constrains its underlying dynamics and how to recover them. We introduce the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous dynamics that preserve a given pattern distribution. Our method successfully identifies plausible dynamics for 2-D systems and recovers the signature chaotic behavior of the Lorenz attractor. For high-dimensional Turing patterns from the Gray-Scott model, we develop an efficient, training-free variant that achieves high fidelity to the ground truth, validated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our analysis reveals the solution space is constrained not only by the data but also by the learning model's inductive biases. This capability extends beyond recovering known systems, enabling a new paradigm of inverse design for Artificial Life. By specifying a target pattern distribution, we can discover the local interaction rules that preserve it, leading to the spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors, such as life-like flocking, attraction, and repulsion patterns, from simple, user-defined snapshots.

Kuramoto Mean Field Game with Intrinsic Frequencies
Rene Carmona, Quentin Cormier, Mete Soner
Comments:
33 pages, 2 figures
Subjects:
Functional Analysis (math.FA); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
This paper studies a mean field game formulation of the classical Kuramoto model for synchronization. Our model captures the diversity within the population by considering random intrinsic frequencies, which allows us to study the impact of this heterogeneity on synchronization patterns and stability. Our findings contribute insights into the interplay between intrinsic frequency diversity and synchronization dynamics, offering a more realistic understanding of complex systems. The proposed framework has broad applications ranging from coupled oscillators in physics to social dynamics, and serves as a valuable tool for studying networks with distributed intrinsic frequencies.

Singularity confinement and proliferation of tau functions for a general differential-difference Sawada-Kotera equation

Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
Blending Painlevé property with singularity confinement for a general arbitrary order Sawada-Kotera differential-difference equation, we find a proliferation of ``tau-functions'' (coming from strictly confined patterns). However only one of these function enters into the Hirota bilinear form (the others give multi-linear expressions) but has specific relations with all others. We also discuss the case of two modifications of Sawada-Kotera showing that periodic patterns appear in addition to strictly confined ones. Fully discretisations and express method for computing algebraic entropy are discussed.

Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Title:
Statistical properties of homoclinic bursting: an approach using infinite-modal maps toward predicting extreme events
Masaki Nakagawa
Comments:
15 pages, 14 figures
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Predicting extreme events in nonlinear dynamical systems is challenging due to a limited understanding of their statistical properties. This study numerically and theoretically investigates the statistical properties of infinite-modal maps arising from homoclinic bursting to predict extreme events. The numerical investigation presents bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, height probability distributions, and interevent interval probability distributions for infinite-modal maps. The theoretical analysis derives analytical formulae for these statistical properties using a randomization theory of infinite-modal maps. Furthermore, a parameter estimation method for infinite-modal maps is proposed, utilizing the derived analytical formula, which enables practical application of the theoretical results. Finally, the study demonstrates the applicability of the approach in analyzing non-stationary data with time-dependent parameters. These findings provide a foundation for the prediction of extreme events based on their mechanism.

Diverse patterns of pebbles on sand on Mars and Earth

On Mars, fields of sand dunes contrast with the general cratered, rocky terrain commonly seen from orbit. Near the equator, in Gale Crater, images from the rover, Curiosity, also reveal order on smaller scales: ripples on dunes, and ground patterns in scattered sites. The patterns include relatively inconspicuous forms: evenly spaced pebble-size rocks (termed clasts) on meter-scale domains of wind-blown sand. Here, we examine quantitatively several such domains on both Mars and Earth. The domains are significantly more orderly than expected by chance. Moreover, many are hyperuniform, a self-organized state recently recognized in diverse active materials and biological systems but that appears novel for planetary surfaces. We use numerical simulations to examine how diverse clast distributions, ranging from random and hyperuniform dispersions to distinct alignments, can emerge spontaneously from clast displacements induced by gravity, combined with the wind-driven evolution of the surface, sand transport, and ripple migration. This paper highlights easily overlooked self-organized patterns beyond distinct geometric patterns on at least two planets, and the simulations help understand the information coded in clast domains. Moreover, our methods and findings potentially have quantitatively implications for studies of issues of global significance on Earth, including dust emission from vast areas into the atmosphere.

Title:
How many points converge to a heteroclinic network in an aperiodic way?
Christian Bick, Alexander Lohse
Subjects:
Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Homoclinic and heteroclinic connections can form cycles and networks in phase space, which organize global phenomena in dynamical systems. On the one hand, stability notions for (omni)cycles give insight into how many initial conditions approach the network along a single given (omni)cycle. On the other hand, the term switching is used to describe situations where there are trajectories that follow any possible sequence of heteroclinic connections along the network. Here we give a notion of asymptotic stability for general sequences along a network of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. We show that there cannot be uncountably many aperiodic sequences that attract a set with nontrivial measure. Finally, we discuss examples where one may or may not expect aperiodic convergence towards a network and conclude with some open questions.

Rectangular Recurrence Relations in $\mathfrak{gl}_{n}$ and $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ Invariant Integrable Models

Subjects:
Quantum Algebra (math.QA); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
A new method is introduced to derive general recurrence relations for off-shell Bethe vectors in quantum integrable models with either type $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ or type $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ symmetries. These recurrence relations describe how to add a single parameter $z$ to specific subsets of Bethe parameters, expressing the resulting Bethe vector as a linear combination of monodromy matrix entries that act on Bethe vectors which do not depend on $z$. We refer to these recurrence relations as rectangular because the monodromy matrix entries involved are drawn from the upper-right rectangular part of the matrix. This construction is achieved within the framework of the zero mode method.

Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics

Subjects:

Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.

Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light

Comments:
41 pages, 33 figures

We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fröhlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.
