Title:
From Fractional Differential Equations with Hilfer Derivatives: To Discrete Maps with Memory

Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
In this article, we proposed new discrete maps with memory (DMM). These maps are derived from fractional differential equations (FDE) with the Hilfer fractional derivatives of non-integer orders and periodic sequence of kicks. The suggested DMM are obtained from these equations without any approximation, and they are a discrete form of the exact solutions. DMM are proposed for arbitrary positive orders of equations with the Hilfer fractional derivatives. As an example, the suggested maps are described for the orders lying in the intervals (0,1) and (1,2). The maps, which are derived from the equations with the Hilfer operators, allow us to consider a whole range of the maps derived from the FDE with the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives.

Nonlinear fractional dynamics with scale invariance in continuous and discrete time approaches are described. We use non-integer-order integro-differential operators that can be interpreted as generalizations of scaling (dilation) differential operator for the case of non-locality. Nonlinear integro-differential equations with Hadamard type operators of non-integer orders with respect to time and periodic sequence of kicks are considered. Exact solutions of these equations are derived without using approximations. Using these solutions for discrete time points, we derive mappings with non-local scaling in time from proposed equations without approximation. Non-local mappings are obtained in general for arbitrary orders of the Hadamard type fractional operators. An example of these mappings with non-local scaling in time is given for arbitrary positive orders of integro-differential equations with kicks. The proposed mappings are independent of the period of kicks at zero initial conditions. The proposed approach can be used to describe the nonlinear fractional dynamics that is characterized by scale invariance.

Title:
Turing Patterns in a Morphogenetic Model with Single Regulatory Function
Mohamed Amine Ouchdiri, Saad Benjelloun, Adnane Saoud, Irene Otero-Muras
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
Confirming Turing's theory of morphogens in developmental processes is challenging, and synthetic biology has opened new avenues for testing Turing's predictions. Synthetic mammalian pattern formation has been recently achieved through a reaction-diffusion system based on the short-range activator (Nodal) and the long-range inhibitor (Lefty) topology, where a single function regulates both morphogens. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns in the synthetic Nodal-Lefty system. First, we prove the existence of a global solution and derive conditions for Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Subsequently, we examine the behavior of the system near the bifurcation threshold, employing weakly nonlinear analysis, and using multiple time scales, we derive the amplitude equations for supercritical and subcritical cases. The results demonstrate the ability of the system to support various patterns, with the subcritical Turing instability playing a crucial role in the formation of dissipative structures observed experimentally.

Title:
A Social Force Model for Companion Groups Considering Relative-Weight Attraction

This paper introduces an improved social force model for companion group that incorporates relative weight attraction. Based on the traditional social force model, the interaction forces among individuals within leader-follower groups are described by introducing relative weight attraction. Additionally, a velocity synchronization term is integrated into the pedestrians' self-driving force to address the problem of group dispersion commonly found in traditional models. Furthermore, the desired direction of followers within the companion group is refined to adapt to the evacuation movement led by the group leader. These enhancements collectively form a Social Force Model of companion groups considering relative weight attraction. Through comparative analysis of pedestrian evacuation processes in bidirectional channel simulation experiments between the relative weight attraction model and the traditional molecular potential (force) model, this study finds that the relative weight attraction model demonstrates stronger regulation and following capabilities when simulating collisions between companion groups and pedestrians or obstacles, more effectively ensuring group cohesion. Building upon this foundation, this study further investigates the impact of varying companion ratios on evacuation efficiency within the relative-weight attraction model. The results demonstrate that evacuation time steps exhibit a non-monotonic trend (initial increase, followed by a decrease, and a subsequent rise) as the companion ratio escalates. Additionally, across multiple simulation runs, the standard deviation of evacuation time steps expands with increasing companion ratios, indicating heightened fluctuation in individual evacuation timing.

Title:
The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model

We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.

Title:
The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport

We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.

Defects, parcellation, and renormalized negative diffusivities in non-homogeneous oscillatory media

Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
Spatial non-homogeneities can synchronize clusters of spatially-extended oscillators in different frequency plateaus. Motivated by physiological rhythms, we fully characterize the phase diagram of a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model with a gradient of frequencies. For large gradients and diffusion, the rest state is stable, and the linear spectrum around it maps onto the non-Hermitian Bloch-Torrey equation. When complex pairs of eigenvalues turn unstable, precursors of plateaus grow, separated by defects where the GL amplitude vanishes. Nonlinear effects either saturate the amplitude of plateaus or lead to a phase-locked state, with saddle-node bifurcations separating the two regimes. In the region of plateaus, we trace the formation of defects to a non-linear renormalization of the diffusivity, and determine the scaling of their number and length vs dynamical parameters.

Manipulating topological charges via engineering zeros of wave functions

Topological charges are typically manipulated by managing their energy bands in quantum systems. In this work, we propose a new approach to manipulate the topological charges of systems by engineering density zeros of localized wave excitations in them. We demonstrate via numerical simulation and analytical analysis that the winding number of a toroidal Bose condensate can be well manipulated by engineering the relative velocities between the dark solitons and their backgrounds. The crossing of relative velocities through zero makes a change in winding number by inducing density zeros during acceleration, with the direction of crossing determining whether charge increases or decreases. Possibilities of observing such winding number manipulation are discussed for current experimental settings. This idea may also be to higher dimensions. These results will inspire new pathways in designing topological materials using quantum simulation platforms.

Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems, such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges, remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.

Title:
Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning

Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.

Extended Bose-Hubbard models have been employed in the study of cold-atom systems with dipolar interactions. It is shown that, for a certain choice of the coupling parameters, there exists an integrable extended 3-site Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions. A Bethe ansatz procedure is developed to obtain expressions for the energy spectrum and eigenstates.

Title:
A $\mathcal C^\infty$-structure-based approach to traveling wave solutions of the gKdV equation
Antonio J. Pan-Collantes
Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
A novel geometric method is applied to the problem of describing traveling wave solutions of the generalized Korteweg--de Vries (gKdV) equation in the form $$ u_t + u_{xxx} + a(u)u_x = 0, $$ where $a(u)$ is a smooth function characterizing the nonlinearity. Using the traveling wave ansatz, the gKdV equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which we analyze via the $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure-based method, a geometric framework involving sequences of involutive distributions and Pfaffian equations. Starting with the symmetry $\partial_z$, we construct a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure for the ODE and apply the stepwise integration algorithm to obtain an implicit general solution. Then we derive explicit solutions for specific forms of $a(u)$, including the modified KdV and Schamel--KdV equations, as well as power-law nonlinearities.

Title:
Oscillating ring ferrodark solitons with breathing nematic core in a homogeneous spinor superfluid

Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
We study the dynamics of ring ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.
