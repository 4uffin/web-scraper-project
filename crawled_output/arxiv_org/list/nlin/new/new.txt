Title:
Nonreciprocity induced spatiotemporal chaos: Reactive vs dissipative routes
Jung-Wan Ryu

Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Nonreciprocal interactions fundamentally alter the collective dynamics of nonlinear oscillator networks. Here we investigate Stuart-Landau oscillators on a ring with nonreciprocal reactive or dissipative couplings combined with Kerr-type or dissipative nonlinearities. Through numerical simulations and linear analysis, we uncover two distinct and universal pathways by which enhanced nonreciprocity drives spatiotemporal chaos. Nonreciprocal reactive coupling with Kerr-type nonlinearity amplifies instabilities through growth-rate variations, while nonreciprocal dissipative coupling with Kerr-type nonlinearity broadens eigenfrequency distributions and destroys coherence, which, upon nonlinear saturation, evolve into fully developed chaos. In contrast, dissipative nonlinearities universally suppress chaos, enforcing bounded periodic states. Our findings establish a minimal yet general framework that goes beyond case-specific models and demonstrate that nonreciprocity provides a universal organizing principle for the onset and control of spatiotemporal chaos in oscillator networks and related complex systems.

Spectral statistics of quantum chaotic systems are governed by random matrix universality. In many cases of interest, time-reversal symmetry selects the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as the relevant universality class. In holographic CFTs, this is mirrored by the presence of non-orientable geometries in the dual gravitational path integral. In this work, we analyze general properties of these matrix models and their gravitational counterparts. First, we develop a formalism to express the universal level statistics in the canonical ensemble for arbitrary spectral curves, leading to a topological expansion with finite radius of convergence in the late-time $\tau$-scaling limit. Then, we focus on topological gravity and study topological recursion on the moduli space of non-orientable surfaces. We find that the Weil-Petersson volumes display non-analytic behaviour multiplying polynomials in the boundary lengths. The volumes give rise to wormholes with late-time divergences, in contrast with the orientable case, which is finite. We identify systematic cancellations among WP volumes implied by the consistency and finiteness of the $\tau$-scaling limit. In particular, the cancellation of late-time divergences requires a nontrivial genus resummation. Working in the gravitational microcanonical ensemble, we derive and resum all orders of the topological expansion matching the GOE matrix model in the high-energy regime.

Spatial structure can play an important role in the evolution of cooperative behavior and the achievement of collective success of a population. In this paper, we explore the role of random and directed motion on spatial pattern formation and the payoff achieved by populations in both stochastic and deterministic models of spatial populations who engage in social interactions following a hawk-dove game. For the case of purely diffusive motion, both a stochastic spatial model and a partial differential equation model show that Turing patterns can emerge when hawks have a greater movement rate than doves, and in both models hawks and doves see an increase in population size and average payoff as hawk mobility increases. For the case of the payoff-driven motion, the stochastic model shows an overall decrease in population size and average payoff, but the PDE model displays more subtle behavior in this setting and will depend on the relative diffusivities of the two strategies. The PDE model also displays a biologically infeasible short-wave instability in the case of payoff-driven motion and equal diffusivities, indicating that we need to be careful about the mathematical properties of PDE models with payoff-driven directed motion and indicating potential use for nonlocal PDE models for spatial patterns in evolutionary games with directed motion.

Title:
Non-Commutative Gauge Theory at the Beach

The KP equation is perhaps the most famous example of a three-dimensional integrable system. Here we show that a non-commutative five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory living on the projective spinor bundle of three-dimensional space-time compactifies to a Lagrangian formulation of the KP equation. Essential to the definition of the theory is a 2-form pulled back from minitwistor space. The dispersionless limit of the KP equation is similarly described by Poisson-Chern-Simons theory. We further show that, consistent with integrability, all tree level amplitudes vanish. The universal vertex algebra living on a two-dimensional surface defect in $5d$ is $W_{1+\infty}$, and its operator products coincide with collinear splitting functions on space-time. Taking the dispersionless limit contracts the vertex algebra to $w_{1+\infty}$.

Squeezing codes: robust fluctuation-stabilized memories

We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.

Title:
Diffusive Scaling limit of stochastic Box-Ball systems and PushTASEP

We introduce the Stochastic Box-Ball System (SBBS), a probabilistic cellular automaton that generalizes the classic Takahashi-Satsuma Box-Ball System. In SBBS, particles are transported by a carrier with a fixed capacity that may fail to pick up any given particle with a fixed probability $\epsilon$. This model interpolates between two known integrable systems: the Box-Ball System (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$) and the PushTASEP (as $\epsilon\rightarrow 1$). We show that the long-term behavior of SBBS is governed by isolated particles and the occasional emergence of short solitons, which can form longer solitons but are more likely to fall apart. More precisely, we first show that all particles are isolated except for a $1/\sqrt{n}$-fraction of times in any given $n$ steps and solitons keep forming for this fraction of times. We then establish the diffusive scaling limit of the associated "gap process," which tracks the distances between consecutive particles. Namely, under diffusive scaling, the gap processes for both SBBS (for any carrier capacity) and PushTASEP converge weakly to Semimartingale Reflecting Brownian Motions (SRBMs) on the non-negative orthant with explicit covariance and reflection matrices consistent with the microscale relations between these systems. Moreover, the reflection matrix for SBBS is determined by how 2-solitons behave. Our proof relies on a new, extended SRBM invariance principle that we develop in this work. This principle can handle processes with complex boundary behavior that can be written as "overdetermined" Skorokhod decompositions involving rectangular reflection matrices, which is crucial for analyzing the complex solitonic boundary behavior of SBBS. We believe this tool may be of independent interest.

Title:
Deterministic Discrete Denoising

Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

Title:
Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals
EliÅ¡ka PostavovÃ¡, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno
Comments:
17 pages, 8 figures
Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover differ, reflecting the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.

Title:
Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering
Nikodem Mierski, PaweÅ‚ Pilarczyk
Comments:
25 pages, 5 tables, 14 figures
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.
