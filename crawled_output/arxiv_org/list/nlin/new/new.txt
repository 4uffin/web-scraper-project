Title:
On the model attractor in a high-dimensional neural network dynamics of reservoir computing

The theory of embedding and generalized synchronization in reservoir computing has recently been developed. Under ideal conditions, reservoir computing exhibits generalized synchronization during the learning process. These insights form a rigorous basis for understanding reservoir computing ability to reconstruct and predict complex dynamics. In this study, we clarified the dynamical system structures of generalized synchronization and embedding by comparing the Lyapunov exponents of a high dimensional neural network within the reservoir computing model with those in actual systems. Furthermore, we numerically calculated the Lyapunov exponents restricted to the tangent space of the inertial manifold in a high dimensional neural network. Our results demonstrate that all Lyapunov exponents of the actual dynamics, including negative ones, are successfully identified.

Title:
Deep Learning for Analyzing Chaotic Dynamics in Biological Time Series: Insights from Frog Heart Signals
Carmen Mayora-Cebollero, Flavio H. Fenton, Molly Halprin, Conner Herndon, Mikael J. Toye, Roberto Barrio
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
The study of experimental data is a relevant task in several physical, chemical and biological applications. In particular, the analysis of chaotic dynamics in cardiac systems is crucial as it can be related to some pathological arrhythmias. When working with short and noisy experimental time series, some standard techniques for chaos detection cannot provide reliable results because of such data characteristics. Moreover, when small datasets are available, Deep Learning techniques cannot be applied directly (that is, using part of the data to train the network, and using the trained network to analyze the remaining dataset). To avoid all these limitations, we propose an automatic algorithm that combines Deep Learning and some selection strategies based on a mathematical model of the same nature of the experimental data. To show its performance, we test it with experimental data obtained from ex-vivo frog heart experiments, obtaining highly accurate results.

Title:
Dynamical symmetry breaking described by cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations

The dynamical symmetry breaking associated with the existence and non-existence of breather solutions is studied. Here, nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations are calculated using a high-precision numerical scheme. %%% First, for clarifying the dynamical symmetry breaking, it is necessary to use a sufficiently high-precision scheme in the time-dependent framework. Second, the error of numerical calculations is generally more easily accumulated for calculating hyperbolic equations rather than parabolic equations. Third, numerical calculations become easily unstable for nonlinear cases. Our strategy for the high-precision and stable scheme is to implement the implicit Runge-Kutta method for time, and the Fourier spectral decomposition for space. %%% In this paper, focusing on the breather solutions, the relationship between the velocity, mass, and the amplitude of the perturbation is clarified. As a result, the conditions for transitioning from one state to another are clarified.

Title:
$T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations in four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory

The four-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) theory provides a systematic procedure for realizing two-dimensional integrable field theories. It is therefore a natural question to ask whether integrable deformations of the theories can be realized in the four-dimensional CS theory. In this work, we study $T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional integrable field theories, formulated in terms of dynamical coordinate transformations, within the framework of four-dimensional CS theory coupled to disorder defects. We illustrate our procedure in detail for the degenerate $\mathcal{E}$-model, a specific construction that captures and unifies a broad range of integrable systems, including the principal chiral model.

Title:
Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1

Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincaré map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs high Earth orbits.

Title:
Experimental study of the acoustic frequency-up conversion effect by nonlinear thin plates
Alexis Mousseau, Soizic Terrien, Vincent Tournat
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Classical methods of sound absorption present fundamental limits that can be overcome by using nonlinear effects. Thin clamped plates have been identified as strongly nonlinear elements, capable of transferring the acoustic power of an incident air-borne wave towards higher frequencies. Here, we experimentally show that these plates exhibit different vibrational nonlinear behaviors depending on the amplitude and frequency of the excitation signal. The lowest excitation levels achieved lead to harmonic generation in a weakly nonlinear regime, while higher levels produce quasi-periodic and chaotic regimes. Since these nonlinear vibration regimes govern the acoustic frequency-up conversion process, we investigate the influence of relevant physical and geometrical parameters on the emergence of these nonlinear regimes. A parametric study on plates of different thicknesses reveals that the frequency-up conversion effect is mostly guided by the resonance of the plate at its first eigenfrequency, which depends not only on its thickness but also on a static tension introduced by the clamping. Finally, a design proposition involving multiple plates with different properties is presented in order to reach a broadband frequency-up conversion.

Title:
Dynamics of Quantum Analogs of Classical Impact Oscillators

Subjects:
Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
This paper investigates the dynamics of quantum analogs of classical impact oscillators to explore how complex nonlinear behaviors manifest in quantum systems. While classical impact oscillators exhibit chaos and bifurcations, quantum systems, governed by linear equations, appear to forbid such dynamics. Through simulations of unforced, forced, and dissipative quantum oscillators, we uncover quasiperiodicity, strange nonchaotic dynamics, and even chaos in the presence of dissipation. Using entropy time series, Fourier spectra, OTOCs, Lyapunov analysis, and the 0-1 test, we demonstrate that quantum systems can exhibit rich dynamical signatures analogous to classical nonlinear systems, bridging quantum mechanics and chaos theory.

Title:
Photonic decision making using optical frequency difference detection in mutually-coupled semiconductor lasers
Hidetoshi Taira, Takatomo Mihana, Shun Kotoku, André Röhm, Kazutaka Kanno, Atsushi Uchida, Ryoichi Horisaki
Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
As electronic computing approaches its performance limits, photonic accelerators have emerged as promising alternatives. Photonic accelerators exploiting semiconductor-laser synchronization have been studied for decision-making. While conventional cross-correlation methods are computationally intensive and memory demanding, we propose a frequency-based approach using optical frequency differences. Simulations and experiments confirm that this method achieves decision making with reduced cost and memory requirements.

Title:
Modular families of elliptic long-range spin chains from freezing
Rob Klabbers, Jules Lamers

We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a (quantum) spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type). Finally, we show how freezing fits in the setting of 'hybrid' integrable systems.
