Title:
Statistical Parameter Calibration with the Generalized Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling
Ludovico T. Giorgini, Tobias Bischoff, Andre N. Souza
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
Parameter calibration in complex dynamical systems often relies on costly optimization routines or ad hoc tuning to match statistical properties of observations. In this work, we develop a principled framework for statistical calibration grounded in the Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT). This approach provides exact linear response formulas that relate infinitesimal changes in internal model parameters to infinitesimal changes in statistics of arbitrary observables. In other words, the GFDT yields parameter Jacobians of system statistics without requiring adjoint models, ensemble perturbations, or repeated simulations. We demonstrate the framework's utility across a hierarchy of systems, including analytically tractable linear models, nonlinear double-well potentials, and multiscale stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics. We show that these Jacobians can be embedded within classical optimization schemes - such as Newton-type updates or regularized least squares - to guide parameter updates. The method is further extended to handle perturbations in both drift and diffusion terms, enabling unified treatment of deterministic and stochastic calibration. Our results establish the GFDT as a rigorous and interpretable foundation for parameter tuning in non-equilibrium systems.

Subjects:
Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
We construct the Orlov-Schulman symmetries for the Manakov-Santini (MS) hierarchy. We give an explicit proof of compatibility of additional symmetries with the basic flows of the MS hierarchy, and consider several simple examples, including the Galilean transformation and scalings. We also present a picture of the Orlov-Schulman symmetries in terms of the dressing scheme based on the Riemann-Hilbert problem.

Title:
Diversity mitigates polarization and consensus in opinion dynamics

We study the opinion dynamics in a population by considering a variant of Kuramoto model where the phase of an oscillator represents the opinion of an individual on a single topic. Two extreme phases separated by $\pi$ represent opposing views. Any other phase is considered as an intermediate opinion between the two extremes. The interaction (or attitude) between two individuals depends on the difference between their opinions and can be positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) based on the defined thresholds. We investigate the opinion dynamics when these thresholds are varied. We observe explosive transition from a bipolarized state to a consensus state with the existence of scattered and tri-polarized states at low values of threshold parameter. The system exhibits multistability between various states in a sizeable parameter region. These transitions and multistability are studied in populations with different degrees of diversity represented by the width of conviction distribution. We found that a more homogeneous population has greater tendency to exhibit bipolarized, tri-polarized and clustered states while a diverse population helps mitigate polarization among individuals by reaching to a consensus sooner. Ott-Antonsen analysis is used to analyse the system's long term macroscopic behaviour and verify the numerical results. We also study the effects of neutral individuals that do not interact with others or do not change their attitude on opinion formation, nature of transitions and multistability. Furthermore, we apply our model to language data to study the assimilation of diverse languages in India and compare the results with those obtained from model equations.

Title:
Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $Ï€/2$

We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.

Title:
Chase-and-Run and Chirality in Nonlocal Models of Pattern Formation

Chase-and-run dynamics, in which one population pursues another that flees from it, are found throughout nature, from predator-prey interactions in ecosystems to the collective motion of cells during development. Intriguingly, in many of these systems, the movement is not straight; instead, 'runners' veer off at an angle from their pursuers. This angled movement often exhibits a consistent left-right asymmetry, known as lateralisation or chirality. Inspired by such phenomena in zebrafish skin patterns and evasive animal motion, we explore how chirality shapes the emergence of patterns in nonlocal (integro-differential) advection-diffusion models. We extend such models to allow movement at arbitrary angles, uncovering a rich landscape of behaviours. We find that chirality can enhance pattern formation, suppress oscillations, and give rise to entirely new dynamical structures, such as rotating pulses of chasers and runners. We also uncover how chase-and-run dynamics can cause populations to mix or separate. Through linear stability analysis, we identify physical mechanisms that drive some of these effects, whilst also exposing striking limitations of this theory in capturing more complex dynamics. Our findings suggest that chirality could have roles in ecological and cellular patterning beyond simply breaking left-right symmetry.

Title:
Discrete vs. continuous dynamics in biology: When do they align and when do they diverge?

Many biological systems are governed by difference equations and exhibit discrete-time dynamics. Examples include the size of a population when generations are non-overlapping, and the incidence of a disease when infections are recorded at fixed intervals. For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, continuous-time approximations are frequently employed when small changes occur between discrete time steps.
Here, we present an approach motivated by exactly soluble discrete time problems. We show that such systems have continuous-time descriptions (governed by differential equations) whose solutions precisely agree, at the discrete times, with the discrete time solutions, irrespective of the size of changes that occur.
For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, we develop approximate continuous-time models that can, to high accuracy, capture rapid growth and decay. Our approach employs mappings between difference and differential equations, generating functional solutions that exactly or closely preserve the original discrete time behaviour. It uncovers fundamental structural parallels and also distinctions between the difference equation and the `equivalent' differential equation. The findings we present cover both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous systems.
For completeness, we also consider discrete-time systems with the most rapid oscillatory behaviour possible, namely a sign change each time step. We show, for exactly soluble cases, that such systems also have a continuous-time description, but that this comes at the expense of generally complex-valued solutions.
This work has applications in, for example, population genetics, ecology and epidemic modelling. By bridging discrete and continuous representations of a system, it enhances insights/analysis of different types of dynamics.

Title:
$T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations in four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory

The four-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) theory provides a systematic procedure for realizing two-dimensional integrable field theories. It is therefore a natural question to ask whether integrable deformations of the theories can be realized in the four-dimensional CS theory. In this work, we study $T\bar{T}$ and root-$T\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional integrable field theories, formulated in terms of dynamical coordinate transformations, within the framework of four-dimensional CS theory coupled to disorder defects. We illustrate our procedure in detail for the degenerate $\mathcal{E}$-model, a specific construction that captures and unifies a broad range of integrable systems, including the principal chiral model.
