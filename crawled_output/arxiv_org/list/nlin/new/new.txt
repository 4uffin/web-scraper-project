Title:
Global Bifurcations and Pattern Formation in Target-Offender-Guardian Crime Models
Madi Yerlanov, Qi Wang, Nancy Rodriguez
Comments:
22 figures, 33 pages
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We study a reaction-advection-diffusion model of a target-offender-guardian system designed to capture interactions between urban crime and policing. Using Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theory and spectral analysis, we establish rigorous conditions for both steady-state and Hopf bifurcations. These results identify critical thresholds of policing intensity at which spatially uniform equilibria lose stability, leading either to persistent heterogeneous hotspots or oscillatory crime-policing cycles. From a criminological perspective, such thresholds represent tipping points in guardian mobility: once crossed, they can lock neighborhoods into stable clusters of criminal activity or trigger recurrent waves of hotspot formation. Numerical simulations complement the theory, exhibiting stationary patterns, periodic oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. By explicitly incorporating law enforcement as a third interacting component, our framework extends classical two-equation models. It offers new tools for analyzing nonlinear interactions, bifurcations, and pattern formation in multi-agent social systems.

Title:
Emergent topology of optimal networks for synchrony
Guram Mikaberidze, Dane Taylor

Subjects:
Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO); Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)
Real-world networks, whether shaped by evolution or intelligent design, are typically optimized for some functionality while adhering to physical, geometric, or budget constraints. Yet, theoretical and computational tools for identifying such optimal structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit a combination of counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any given node are highly similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These computational findings are matched by a "constructive" theory for optimal networks; a nonlinear differential equation identifies the optimal pairing of nodes for edges, whereas a variational principle prescribes optimal node-strength allocation. The resulting dynamics provably lack the traditional synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system becomes globally phase-locked, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have broad implications for real-world systems including power grids, neuromorphic computing, and coupled oscillator technologies.

Title:
Cusp solitons mediated by a topological nonlinearity
Harvey Cao, Daniel Leykam
Comments:
8 pages, 5 figures
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Nonlinearity in the Schrödinger equation gives rise to rich phenomena such as soliton formation, modulational instability, and self-organization in diverse physical systems. Motivated by recent advances in engineering nonlinear gauge fields in Bose-Einstein condensates, we introduce a nonlinear Schrödinger model whose dynamics are dependent on the curvature of the wavefunction intensity and show that this has a direct link to a topological quantity from persistent homology. Our model energetically penalizes or favours the formation of local extrema and we demonstrate through numerical simulations that this topological nonlinearity leads to the emergence of robust, cusp-like soliton structures and supports flat-top beams which do not suffer from conventional modulational instability. These findings suggest that topological nonlinearities could serve as a versatile tool for controlling nonlinear waves in optics and Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title:
Exact Dimensional Reduction for Quasi-Linear ODE Ensembles
Felix Augustsson, Erik Andreas Martens, Rok Cestnik
Subjects:
Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO); Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)
We present an exact dimensional reduction for high-dimensional dynamical systems composed of $N$ identical dynamical units governed by quasi-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of order $M$. In these systems, each unit follows a linear differential equation whose coefficients depend nonlinearly on the ensemble variables, such as a mean field variable. We derive $M+1$ closed-form macroscopic equations of order $M$ with variables that exactly capture the full microscopic dimensional dynamics and that allow reconstruction of individual trajectories from the reduced system. Our approach enables low-dimensional analysis of collective behavior in coupled oscillator networks and provides computationally efficient exact representations of large-scale dynamics. We illustrate the theory with examples, highlighting new families of solvable models relevant to physics, biology and engineering that are now amenable to simplified analysis.

Title:
Predator-prey models with memory and kicks: Exact solution and discrete maps with memory
Vasily E. Tarasov
Comments:
19 pages. LaTeX
Journal-ref:
Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences. 2021. Vol.44. No.14. P.11514-11525
Subjects:
Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE); Dynamical Systems (math.DS); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)
In this paper, we proposed new predator-prey models that take into account memory and kicks. Memory is understood as the dependence of current behavior on the history of past behavior. The equations of these proposed models are generalizations of the Lotka-Volterra and Kolmogorov equations by using the Caputo fractional derivative of non-integer order and periodic kicks. This fractional derivative allows us to take into account memory with power-law fading. The periodic kicks, which are described by Dirac delta-functions, take into account short duration of interaction between predators and prey. For the proposed equations, which are fractional differential equations with kicks, we obtain exact solutions that describe behaviors of predator and prey with power-law fading memory. Using these exact solutions, we derive, without using any approximations, new discrete maps with memory that represent the proposed predator-prey models with memory.

Title:
Complexity of Activity Patterns in a Bio-Inspired Hopfield-Type Network in Different Topologies

Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.

Title:
Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system
Bryn Davies
Subjects:
Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD); Mathematical Physics (math-ph); Dynamical Systems (math.DS)
We show that the statistics of a chaotic system can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators and computing their densities of states. For such operators, the density of states is well understood and can be computed straightforwardly, often yielding explicit formulas. As a case study, we investigate a nonlinear recursion relation that maps naturally onto a family of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This correspondence enables us to derive an explicit formula for the limiting statistics of the chaotic system and to demonstrate that the clustering near to critical values is equivalent to the van Hove singularities in the operators' densities of states.

Title:
Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs

Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.

Title:
Image Inpainting based on Visual-Neural-Inspired Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging Technology
Yonghao Wu, Chang Liu, Vladimir Filaretov, Dmitry Yukhimets
Subjects:
Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)
Conventional image inpainting methods operate on whole images. Drawing on cortical processing principles this study addresses the bottlenecks of conventional holistic image inpainting methods--susceptibility to informational redundancy and low computational efficiency under occlusions and complex backgrounds, by proposing a novel framework: "Specific Object-of-Interest Imaging". This stage extracts and encodes object-level representations from complex scenes, generating semantic and structural priors that can be seamlessly integrated into any inpainting framework. On our Teapot object dataset, Elephant object dataset, Giraffe object dataset and Zebra object dataset experimental validation demonstrates--compared with the repair model without using this method, the repair model using this method has more advantages, across metrics including SSIM, PSNR, MAE, and LPIPS, while maintaining robustness in extreme scenarios (low illumination, high noise, multi-object occlusion, motion blur). Theoretical analysis integrated with cognitive neuroscience perspectives reveals profound correlations between the "object precedence perception" mechanism and dynamic feature modulation in visual cortices (V1--V4). We demonstrate that incorporating Stage I significantly enhances object consistency and semantic coherence across various mainstream inpainting models. This work not only achieves efficient and precise target-centric imaging but also pioneers interdisciplinary pathways bridging brain-inspired computational frameworks with advanced image inpainting techniques.

Title:
The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs
M. Bertola
Comments:

Subjects:

On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.
