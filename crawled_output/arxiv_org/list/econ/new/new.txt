Title:
The Role of Informal Care in Cognitive Outcome and Healthcare Utilization Among Older Adults with Dementia
Mohammad Abdullah Al Faisal
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper examines the relationship between informal caregiving and both cognitive functioning and healthcare utilization among older adults with dementia. Using data from the RAND version of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal panel of U.S. adults over age 50, covering the years 2010 to 2022, I estimate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Instrumental Variables (IV) models to address potential endogeneity in caregiving decisions. The number of children is employed as an instrument for informal care intensity. While OLS estimates suggest a negative association between informal caregiving and cognition, IV estimates show no significant causal effect after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and lagged cognition variables. In contrast, IV results indicate that informal care significantly reduces the likelihood of nursing home use, the number of institutional nights, and the probability of institutionalization. No robust causal effects are found for hospital use, doctor visits, or outpatient surgery, although there is some suggestive evidence of a complementary relationship between informal care and home health services. These findings highlight the role of informal caregiving in substituting for institutional care and underscore its importance in long-term care policy for dementia patients. Keywords: Informal Caregiving; Cognitive Decline; Instrumental Variables; Healthcare Utilization: Dementia Patients.

Title:
An Advection-Difusion Model Incorporating Investor Inertia for the Dynamics of Financial Asset Prices
Diego, Gustavo
Comments:

Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
Standard models of asset price dynamics, such as geometric Brownian motion (Osborne, 1959, Samuelson, 2016), do not formally incorporate investor inertia. This paper introduces a novel framework for modelling stock price dynamics that incorporates the concept of investor inertia, inspired by diffusion with retention models (Bevilacqua, 2011). The asset's log-price is modelled as a three-state discrete random walk, allowing for movements in any of three directions: up, down, or neutral. We demonstrate that this framework naturally leads to an advection-diffusion partial differential equation, in which the advection (drift) term arises directly from the asymmetry between buying, selling, and holding decisions. Remarkably, the model implies that log-prices follow a normal distribution a finding of great practical interest due to its analytical tractability. The applicability of the model is confirmed through simulation and an empirical application using Brazilian this http URL data.

Title:
Optimal estimation for regression discontinuity design with binary outcomes
Takuya Ishihara, Masayuki Sawada, Kohei Yata
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST); Methodology (stat.ME)
We develop a finite-sample optimal estimator for regression discontinuity designs when the outcomes are bounded, including binary outcomes as the leading case. Our finite-sample optimal estimator achieves the exact minimax mean squared error among linear shrinkage estimators with nonnegative weights when the regression function of a bounded outcome lies in a Lipschitz class. Although the original minimax problem involves an iterating (n+1)-dimensional non-convex optimization problem where n is the sample size, we show that our estimator is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. A key advantage of our estimator is that the Lipschitz constant is the only tuning parameter. We also propose a uniformly valid inference procedure without a large-sample approximation. In a simulation exercise for small samples, our estimator exhibits smaller mean squared errors and shorter confidence intervals than conventional large-sample techniques which may be unreliable when the effective sample size is small. We apply our method to an empirical multi-cutoff design where the sample size for each cutoff is small. In the application, our method yields informative confidence intervals, in contrast to the leading large-sample approach.

Title:
Driver Identification and PCA Augmented Selection Shrinkage Framework for Nordic System Price Forecasting
Yousef Adeli Sadabad, Mohammad Reza Hesamzadeh, Gyorgy Dan, Matin Bagherpour, Darryl R. Biggar
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
The System Price (SP) of the Nordic electricity market serves as a key reference for financial hedge contracts such as Electricity Price Area Differentials (EPADs) and other risk management instruments. Therefore, the identification of drivers and the accurate forecasting of SP are essential for market participants to design effective hedging strategies. This paper develops a systematic framework that combines interpretable drivers analysis with robust forecasting methods. It proposes an interpretable feature engineering algorithm to identify the main drivers of the Nordic SP based on a novel combination of K-means clustering, Multiple Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (MSTD), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Then, it applies principal component analysis (PCA) to the identified data matrix, which is adapted to the downstream task of price forecasting to mitigate the issue of imperfect multicollinearity in the data. Finally, we propose a multi-forecast selection-shrinkage algorithm for Nordic SP forecasting, which selects a subset of complementary forecast models based on their bias-variance tradeoff at the ensemble level and then computes the optimal weights for the retained forecast models to minimize the error variance of the combined forecast. Using historical data from the Nordic electricity market, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms individual input models uniformly, robustly, and significantly, while maintaining a comparable computational cost. Notably, our systematic framework produces superior results using simple input models, outperforming the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Furthermore, we show that our approach also exceeds the performance of several well-established practical forecast combination methods.

Title:
Existence and Calculation of Optimal Equilibria on Overlapping Generations Economies
Leandro Lyra Braga Dognini
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
A well-known feature of overlapping generations economies is that the First Welfare Theorem fails and equilibrium may be inefficient. The Cass (1972) criterion furnishes a necessary and sufficient condition for efficiency, but does not address the matter of existence of efficient equilibria, and Cass, Okuno, and Zilcha (1979) provide nonexistence examples. I develop an algorithm based on successive approximations of a nonstationary, consumption-loan, prone to savings, overlapping generations economy with finite-lived heterogeneous agents to find elements of its set of equilibria as the limit of nested compact sets. These compact sets are the result of a backward calculation through equilibrium equations that departs from the set of Pareto optimal equilibria of well-behaved tail economies. The equilibria calculated through this algorithm satisfy the Cass (1972) criterion and are used to derive the existence results on efficient equilibria.

Title:
Predicting Credit Spreads and Ratings with Machine Learning: The Role of Non-Financial Data
Yanran Wu, Xinlei Zhang, Quanyi Xu, Qianxin Yang, Chao Zhang
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
We build a 167-indicator comprehensive credit risk indicator set, integrating macro, corporate financial, bond-specific indicators, and for the first time, 30 large-scale corporate non-financial indicators. We use seven machine learning models to construct a bond credit spread prediction model, test their spread predictive power and economic mechanisms, and verify their credit rating prediction effectiveness. Results show these models outperform Chinese credit rating agencies in explaining credit spreads. Specially, adding non-financial indicators more than doubles their out-of-sample performance vs. traditional feature-driven models. Mechanism analysis finds non-financial indicators far more important than traditional ones (macro-level, financial, bond features)-seven of the top 10 are non-financial (e.g., corporate governance, property rights nature, information disclosure evaluation), the most stable predictors. Models identify high-risk traits (deteriorating operations, short-term debt, higher financing constraints) via these indicators for spread prediction and risk identification. Finally, we pioneer a credit rating model using predicted spreads (predicted implied rating model), with full/sub-industry models achieving over 75% accuracy, recall, F1. This paper provides valuable guidance for bond default early warning, credit rating, and financial stability.

Title:
Group Formation through Game Theory and Agent-Based Modeling: Spatial Cohesion, Heterogeneity, and Resource Pooling
Chenlan Wang, Jimin Han, Diana Jue-Rajasingh
Comments:
This work has been accepted by the 61st Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing
Subjects:
Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
This paper develops a game-theoretic model and an agent-based model to study group formation driven by resource pooling, spatial cohesion, and heterogeneity. We focus on cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) involving public, private, and nonprofit organizations, each contributing distinct resources. Group formation occurs as agents strategically optimize their choices in response to others within a competitive setting. We prove the existence of stable group equilibria and simulate formation dynamics under varying spatial and resource conditions. The results show that limited individual resources lead to groups that form mainly among nearby actors, while abundant resources allow groups to move across larger distances. Increased resource heterogeneity and spatial proximity promote the formation of larger and more diverse groups. These findings reveal key trade-offs shaping group size and composition, guiding strategies for effective cross-sector collaborations and multi-agent systems.

Filtering amplitude dependence of correlation dynamics in complex systems: application to the cryptocurrency market

Based on the cryptocurrency market dynamics, this study presents a general methodology for analyzing evolving correlation structures in complex systems using the $q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient \rho(q,s). By extending traditional metrics, this approach captures correlations at varying fluctuation amplitudes and time scales. The method employs $q$-dependent minimum spanning trees ($q$MSTs) to visualize evolving network structures. Using minute-by-minute exchange rate data for 140 cryptocurrencies on Binance (Jan 2021-Oct 2024), a rolling window analysis reveals significant shifts in $q$MSTs, notably around April 2022 during the Terra/Luna crash. Initially centralized around Bitcoin (BTC), the network later decentralized, with Ethereum (ETH) and others gaining prominence. Spectral analysis confirms BTC's declining dominance and increased diversification among assets. A key finding is that medium-scale fluctuations exhibit stronger correlations than large-scale ones, with $q$MSTs based on the latter being more decentralized. Properly exploiting such facts may offer the possibility of a more flexible optimal portfolio construction. Distance metrics highlight that major disruptions amplify correlation differences, leading to fully decentralized structures during crashes. These results demonstrate $q$MSTs' effectiveness in uncovering fluctuation-dependent correlations, with potential applications beyond finance, including biology, social and other complex systems.

Title:
Watts and Drops: Co-Scheduling Power and Water in Desalination Plants
Ahmed S. Alahmed, Audun Botterud, Saurabh Amin, Ali T. Al-Awami
Comments:
5 pages, 6 figures. To appear in Proceedings of the 61st Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing
Subjects:
Systems and Control (eess.SY); Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
We develop a mathematical framework to jointly schedule water and electricity in a profit-maximizing renewable colocated water desalination plant that integrates both thermal and membrane based technologies. The price-taking desalination plant sells desalinated water to a water utility at a given price and engages in bidirectional electricity transactions with the grid, purchasing or selling power based on its net electricity demand. We show that the optimal scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.

Title:
Cointegration with Occasionally Binding Constraints
James A. Duffy, Sophocles Mavroeidis, Sam Wycherley
Comments:
ii + 58 pp., 4 figures; author accepted manuscript
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistics Theory (math.ST)
In the literature on nonlinear cointegration, a long-standing open problem relates to how a (nonlinear) vector autoregression, which provides a unified description of the short- and long-run dynamics of a vector of time series, can generate 'nonlinear cointegration' in the profound sense of those series sharing common nonlinear stochastic trends. We consider this problem in the setting of the censored and kinked structural VAR (CKSVAR), which provides a flexible yet tractable framework within which to model time series that are subject to threshold-type nonlinearities, such as those arising due to occasionally binding constraints, of which the zero lower bound (ZLB) on short-term nominal interest rates provides a leading example. We provide a complete characterisation of how common linear and nonlinear stochastic trends may be generated in this model, via unit roots and appropriate generalisations of the usual rank conditions, providing the first extension to date of the Granger-Johansen representation theorem to a nonlinearly cointegrated setting, and thereby giving the first successful treatment of the open problem. The limiting common trend processes include regulated, censored and kinked Brownian motions, none of which have previously appeared in the literature on cointegrated VARs. Our results and running examples illustrate that the CKSVAR is capable of supporting a far richer variety of long-run behaviour than is a linear VAR, in ways that may be particularly useful for the identification of structural parameters.

Title:
Concentration-Based Inference for Evaluating Horizontal Mergers
Paul S. Koh
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Antitrust authorities routinely rely on market concentration measures to assess the potential adverse effects of mergers on consumer welfare. Using a first-order approximation argument with logit and CES demand, I derive the relationship between the welfare effect of a merger on consumer surplus and the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). My results suggest that merger harm is correlated with the merger-induced change in HHI, and the proportionality coefficient depends on the price responsiveness parameter, market size, and the distribution of market shares within and across the merging firms. I present numerical validation of my formula along with an empirical illustration.

Title:
Prudence and higher-order risk attitudes in the rank-dependent utility model
Ruodu Wang, Qinyu Wu
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
We obtain a full characterization of consistency with respect to higher-order stochastic dominance within the rank-dependent utility model. Different from the results in the literature, we do not assume any condition on the utility functions and the probability weighting functions, such as differentiability or continuity. It turns out that the level of generality that we offer leads to models that do not have a continuous probability weighting function and yet they satisfy prudence. In particular, the corresponding probability weighting function can only have a jump at 1, and must be linear on [0,1).

Title:
General Social Agents
Benjamin S. Manning, John J. Horton
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Useful social science theories predict behavior across settings. However, applying a theory to make predictions in new settings is challenging: rarely can it be done without ad hoc modifications to account for setting-specific factors. We argue that AI agents put in simulations of those novel settings offer an alternative for applying theory, requiring minimal or no modifications. We present an approach for building such "general" agents that use theory-grounded natural language instructions, existing empirical data, and knowledge acquired by the underlying AI during training. To demonstrate the approach in settings where no data from that data-generating process exists--as is often the case in applied prediction problems--we design a heterogeneous population of 883,320 novel games. AI agents are constructed using human data from a small set of conceptually related but structurally distinct "seed" games. In preregistered experiments, on average, agents predict initial human play in a random sample of 1,500 games from the population better than (i) a cognitive hierarchy model, (ii) game-theoretic equilibria, and (iii) out-of-the-box agents. For a small set of separate novel games, these simulations predict responses from a new sample of human subjects better even than the most plausibly relevant published human data.

Title:
Economic Complexity Alignment and Sustainable Development
Quinten De Wettinck, Karolien De Bruyne, Wouter Bam, César A. Hidalgo
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Economic complexity has been linked to sustainability outcomes, such as income inequality and greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, it is unclear whether the pursuit of complex and/or related activities naturally aligns with these outcomes, or whether meeting sustainability goals requires policy interventions that pursue unrelated diversification. Here, we exploit multidimensional social and environmental sustainability indicators to quantify the alignment between a country's closest diversification opportunities and sustainability goals. We find that high- and upper-middle-income countries face significantly better environmentally aligned diversification opportunities than poorer economies. This means that, while richer countries enjoy diversification opportunities that align complexity, relatedness and environmental performance, this alignment is weaker for developing economies. These findings underscore the value of evaluating future diversification trajectories through a multidimensional sustainability framework, and emphasise the strategic relevance of unrelated diversification for less developed economies to foster sustainable development.

Title:
Quasi-randomization tests for network interference
Supriya Tiwari, Pallavi Basu
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Econometrics (econ.EM)
Network interference amounts to the treatment status of one unit affecting the potential outcome of other units in the population. Testing for spillover effects in this setting makes the null hypothesis non-sharp. An interesting approach to tackling the non-sharp nature of the null hypothesis in this setup is constructing conditional randomization tests such that the null is sharp on the restricted population. In randomized experiments, conditional randomized tests hold finite sample validity and are assumption-lean. In this paper, we incorporate the network amongst the population as a random variable instead of being fixed. We propose a new approach that builds a conditional quasi-randomization test. To build the (non-sharp) null distribution of no spillover effects, we use random graph null models. We show that our method is exactly valid in finite samples under mild assumptions. Our method displays enhanced power over state-of-the-art methods, with a substantial improvement in cluster randomized trials. We illustrate our methodology to test for interference in a weather insurance adoption experiment run in rural China.
