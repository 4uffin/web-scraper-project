Title:
Integrated analysis of informality, minimum wage, and monopsony power: A synthesis of meta-analyses with unified theoretical underpinnings
Ricardo Alonzo Fernandez Salguero
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
This document offers a synthesis of recent economic literature on three interconnected areas of labor markets: informality, the effects of the minimum wage, and monopsony power. Through the consolidation and meta-analysis of findings from multiple existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, their causes, consequences, and associated public policies are examined. It is concluded that conventional views on these topics often overestimate the magnitude of effects. Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering formalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the extensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage on employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently modest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains. To reconcile and microfound these findings, an integrated theoretical model of firm optimization is introduced, simultaneously incorporating firm heterogeneity, monopsony power, and endogenous formality decisions, rigorously demonstrating how the interaction of these forces can explain the observed empirical regularities. A cross-cutting and significant finding is the omnipresence of publication bias across all these study areas, which tends to inflate the magnitude of the effects reported in the published literature. Corrected estimates of the effects generally approach zero. Meta-regression is established as an indispensable tool for identifying heterogeneity and the true underlying effects in the empirical evidence, compelling a recalibration of both theory and economic policy recommendations towards a more nuanced and integrated approach.

Title:
Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities
Shanjukta Nath, Jiwon Hong, Jae Ho Chang, Keith Warren, Subhadeep Paul
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); General Economics (econ.GN); Methodology (stat.ME)
We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks, multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction and feedback.

Title:
Börgers's Open Question Resolved
Siyang Xiong
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
Focusing on stochastic finite-action mechanisms, we study implementation in undominated strategies and iteratively undominated strategies. We establish both possibility and impossibility results that resolve the open question in Börgers (1995). Contrary to the conventional understanding that positive results on Nash implementation need separability, quasilinearity, or infinite action sets, we provide -- to our knowledge -- the first positive result beyond those demanding assumptions.

Title:
Overidentification testing with weak instruments and heteroskedasticity
Stuart Lane, Frank Windmeijer

Exogeneity is key for IV estimators, which can assessed via overidentification (OID) tests. We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects, sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of the range of EIS estimates in the literature.

Title:
Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions
Lars van der Laan, Nathan Kallus, Aurélien Bibaut
Subjects:
Machine Learning (cs.LG); Econometrics (econ.EM); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML)
Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

Title:
Diffusion in dynamic networks with time-varying inputs to allocate responsibility
Rosa van den Ende, Dylan Laplace Mermoud
Subjects:
Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)
Responsibility in complex networks extends beyond direct actions: players should also bear responsibility for the indirect effects within their supply chains or network. We introduce a novel framework to allocate responsibility for indirect environmental, social, and economic impacts across a dynamic network. Unlike static approaches, our framework accounts for the evolving structure of supply chains, financial systems, and other interconnected systems, where relationships change over time. We use the time-dependent Laplacian matrix to capture how responsibility propagates through the network, revealing a diffusion process that aligns with key axioms of fairness: linearity, efficiency, symmetry, and the independent player property. We show that approximating the responsibility measure preserves these properties, supporting the use of our framework as a rigorous method to allocate responsibility in real-world networks.

Title:
Difference-in-Differences Meets Synthetic Control: Doubly Robust Identification and Estimation
Yixiao Sun, Haitian Xie, Yuhang Zhang
Subjects:
Econometrics (econ.EM)
Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Synthetic Control (SC) are widely used methods for causal inference in panel data, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We propose a novel method for short-panel causal inference that integrates the advantages of both approaches. Our method delivers a doubly robust identification strategy for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under either of two non-nested assumptions: parallel trends or a group-level SC condition. Building on this identification result, we develop a unified semiparametric framework for estimating the ATT. Notably, the identification-robust moment function satisfies Neyman orthogonality under the parallel trends assumption but not under the SC assumption, leading to different asymptotic variances across the two identification strategies. To ensure valid inference, we propose a multiplier bootstrap method that consistently approximates the asymptotic distribution under either assumption. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to accommodate repeated cross-sectional data and staggered treatment designs. As an empirical application, we evaluate the impact of the 2003 minimum wage increase in Alaska on family income. Finally, in simulation studies based on empirically calibrated data-generating processes, we demonstrate that the proposed estimation and inference methods perform well in finite samples under either identification assumption.

Title:
Interpreting the Interpreter: Can We Model post-ECB Conferences Volatility with LLM Agents?
Umberto Collodel
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This paper develops a novel method to simulate financial market reactions to European Central Bank (ECB) press conferences using Large Language Models (LLMs). We create a behavioral, agent-based simulation of 30 synthetic traders, each with distinct risk preferences, cognitive biases, and interpretive styles. These agents interpret ECB communication and forecast Euro interest rate swap levels at 3-month, 2-year, and 10-year maturities, with cross-sectional variation serving as a measure of market uncertainty. Using a comprehensive dataset of 283 ECB press conferences (1998-2025), we evaluate three prompting strategies: naive zero-shot, few-shot (enriched with historical context), and an advanced iterative 'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework. We find that even the naive approach achieves substantial correlations (roughly 0.5) between synthetic disagreement and actual post-announcement OIS volatility, particularly for medium- and long-term maturities. The 'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework further enhances performance upon initial application, reaching correlations of almost 0.6 and identifying key drivers of volatility. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based agents can effectively capture the heterogeneous interpretive processes through which monetary policy signals propagate to financial markets, moving beyond traditional reduced-form event studies. This provides central banks with a practical tool to ex-ante evaluate communication strategies and anticipate market reactions, while offering researchers a micro-founded framework for understanding expectation formation in response to central bank communication.

Title:
There must be an error here! Experimental evidence on coding errors' biases
Bruno Ferman, Lucas Finamor
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
Quantitative research relies heavily on coding, and coding errors are relatively common even in published research. In this paper, we examine whether individuals are more or less likely to check their code depending on the results they obtain. We test this hypothesis in a randomized experiment embedded in the recruitment process for research positions at a large international economic organization. In a coding task designed to assess candidates' programming abilities, we randomize whether participants obtain an expected or unexpected result if they commit a simple coding error. We find that individuals are almost 20% more likely to detect coding errors when they lead to unexpected results. This asymmetry in error detection depending on the results they generate suggests that coding errors may lead to biased findings in scientific research.

Title:
Demand and consumer surplus in the payday-loan market: Evidence from British Columbia
Tim Zhang, Amity Quinn
Subjects:
General Economics (econ.GN)
This study examines how interest rate caps affect the demand for payday loans, using aggregate data from British Columbia (2012--2019) during which the province's maximum fee was reduced from \$23 to \$17 and then to \$15 per \$100 borrowed. Estimating a linear demand function via OLS, we find that lowering interest rate caps significantly increases loan demand. We estimate that the \$8 decrease, from \$23 to \$15 per \$100, raised annual consumer surplus by roughly \$28.6 million (2012 CAD). A further reduction to \$14, starting in January 2025, would add another \$3.9 million per year. These results suggest that stricter interest rate caps can yield substantial consumer welfare gains.

Title:
An Efficient Multi-scale Leverage Effect Estimator under Dependent Microstructure Noise
Ziyang Xiong, Zhao Chen, Christina Dan Wang
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); Econometrics (econ.EM); Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)
Estimating the leverage effect from high-frequency data is vital but challenged by complex, dependent microstructure noise, often exhibiting non-Gaussian higher-order moments. This paper introduces a novel multi-scale framework for efficient and robust leverage effect estimation under such flexible noise structures. We develop two new estimators, the Subsampling-and-Averaging Leverage Effect (SALE) and the Multi-Scale Leverage Effect (MSLE), which adapt subsampling and multi-scale approaches holistically using a unique shifted window technique. This design simplifies the multi-scale estimation procedure and enhances noise robustness without requiring the pre-averaging approach. We establish central limit theorems and stable convergence, with MSLE achieving convergence rates of an optimal $n^{-1/4}$ and a near-optimal $n^{-1/9}$ for the noise-free and noisy settings, respectively. A cornerstone of our framework's efficiency is a specifically designed MSLE weighting strategy that leverages covariance structures across scales. This significantly reduces asymptotic variance and, critically, yields substantially smaller finite-sample errors than existing methods under both noise-free and realistic noisy settings. Extensive simulations and empirical analyses confirm the superior efficiency, robustness, and practical advantages of our approach.
