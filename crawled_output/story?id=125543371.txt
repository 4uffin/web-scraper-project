Because what this appears to be is an end-run around the United States' obligation ... You send them Ghana, and you say, 'But, oh, Ghana says they're not going to send them home' and Ghana immediately prepares to send them home with what appears to be your full awareness."Ghana's President John Mahama speaks to the media at the Jubilee House in Accra, Ghana, Sept. 10, 2025.Ghana Presidency via APChutkan also said to the government attorney, "This flies in the face of your representation to me that the government received assurances from the Ghanaian government that they wouldn't do exactly what they're doing."Popular ReadsUtah governor says alleged Kirk shooter not cooperating with authorities2 hours agoUS official says personnel from Navy ship inspected Venezuelan boat for drugsSep 13, 7:57 PMSuspect in shooting of Georgia officer in custody after manhuntSep 13, 8:42 PMThe government attorney agreed that Ghana seemed to not be following the assurances they had given to the U.S. government, but added again that "the United States does not have the ability to tell Ghana what to do with these individuals."MORE: Supreme Court says administration can remove 8 migrants being held in DjiboutiThe government attorney also said that while it's "a frustrating situation," the court did not have standing to tell the government how to conduct foreign diplomacy.The judge questioned if the case could be wrapped into another case being heard in the Massachusetts District Court that deals with the issue of deportations to third countries, where the person is not originally from.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers make an arrest in a photo released by the agency on March 20, 2018.ICEThe lawyer for the migrants argued that the court could order the government to facilitate the return to the U.S. of these individuals or at least ask Ghana to not move them on to their home countries. The lawyer pointed to the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was able to be returned from El Salvador, and the Supreme Court had ruled the court could order the government to "facilitate" his return.The lawyer also urged that time was of the essence, as some of the individuals could be moved as soon as Monday.Related TopicsImmigrationTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsMortgage rates are falling fast.
