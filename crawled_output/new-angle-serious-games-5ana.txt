New Angle : Serious Games
#mentalhealth

I just released two small serious games to spark conversations about mental-health awareness:
🎮 ADHD Study-Enhancer Misuse
👉 https://codepen.io/nad-Yunny/pen/empwPNe
🎮 Bipolar & BPD Stereotypes
👉 https://codepen.io/nad-Yunny/pen/empwPgM
Although I’m personally diagnosed with autism and bipolar, I feel strongly about highlighting issues beyond my own experience.
BPD especially carries heavy stigma—often unfairly labelled “dangerous”—and that keeps many from seeking help.
These games aren’t medical advice; they’re interactive ways to start honest conversations about medication misuse, mood shifts, and social pressure.

Hey everyone, I've just started my dev journey and wanted to share my first big project: a simple cookie catcher game! I'd appreciate any feedback on my code!
