And I applaud this masterpiece of sarcastic defiance posted over a school's copy machine:
chetuboy101 / Via reddit.com
It reads:"Warning!This machine is subject to breakdowns during periods of critical need.A special circuit in the machine called a CRITICAL NEED DETECTOR senses the operator's emotional state in terms of how desperate he or she is to use the machine. The CRITICAL NEED DETECTOR then creates a malfunction proportional to the desperation of the operator. Threatening the machine with violence only aggravates the situation. Likewise, attempts to use another machine may cause it also to malfunction. They belong to the same union. Keep calm and say nice things to the machine, nothing else seems to work."
