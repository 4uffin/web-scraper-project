1. A durable honeycomb drawer insert, because it's borderline impossible to keep those sock and undie drawers organized, even if you're the most Type A human. These neat little compartments are designed to corral your socks, scarves, ties, undies, etc. in style, because a more organized drawer = a drawer that can hold more.www.amazon.comThe pieces just *snap* together for easy assembly, and the design expands to fit whatever size drawer you have.Promising review: "Okay, admittedly, I am a bit of an organization freak. I purchased two of these organizers (yes, you do need two PER drawer) to organize my underwear drawer. I agree that $20 seems like a lot to pay for a few pieces of plastic to organize a drawer no one else really sees, but...It's totally worth it. The gratification I got from being able to see exactly what I had, neatly organized, easy to find...Wow. I definitely recommend this product. And the actual dividers are well-made and super easy to assemble. As a previous reviewer said, the number of times you will look at your drawer and be totally satisfied makes the price well worth it." —BrigetteGet it from Amazon for $5.50 (drawer dividers are also available in the same listing).
2. A compact Levoit air purifier with a true HEPA filter to trap that pesky dust, pollen, smoke, pet dander, and other particles in the air that are keeping your home from smelling fresh — and make it look like you haven't cleaned in ages, when you totally dusted yesterday. Plus, this has smart features, like the ability to control it from your phone *and* the ability to set a schedule, so it'll automatically set itself to "sleep mode" with "no nightlight" at 10 pm every night. Now that's smart.www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comI have the non-smart version of this in my bedroom, and I love it. Just note that when you get it, you need to take the filter out and unwrap it before using!Promising review: "I waited over a month to write a review — this air purifier is amazing!! It’s one of those products that you don’t understand how much of a difference it makes until you get one. I have two cats,and my house is all carpet, so the house can smell stagnant sometimes, especially if the AC is off. One of my cats also has asthma, so I got this air purifier mostly for her, but it’s made such a HUGE difference in the way my home smells. Since having it, my house has consistently smelled fresh, clean, and odorless. Even after forgetting to clean the litter boxes, my house has not smelled like cat litter since I’ve had it. It’s very easy to set up. I bought a little plant stand to put it on so it wouldn’t be on the carpet. It’s very quiet, and the app is easy to use. It tells you the life of your filter, which is super helpful, and these filters last for a long time! You can set it up to be on a schedule, so you can set it up once and just forget about it. I recommend this air purifier to everyone. I’m NEVER worried about my house smelling anything but clean now. I would repurchase this a thousand times over." —haileeGet it from Amazon for $89.97.
3. And a pack of damp sponges that make dusting baseboards, shelves, and more almost effortless (and are an alternative to the more expensive and always sold-out Scrub Daddy Damp Duster). Just dampen and wipe whatever surface needs dusting — all the dust (and even pet hair!) will accumulate on the ridged surface. Just rinse clean and you're done!www.amazon.comI bought a pack of these and love dusting with them! All the dust sticks right on, so you don't end up breathing in all the dust you just tried removing. It's great for baseboards, too!Promising review: "I rarely review products, but this little sponge literally changed my life! It picks up EVERYthing in one swipe! Hard water marks on your bathroom mirror, no problem! Hair clippings on your sink and counter, one swipe and they are gone! Dusty blinds? Swoosh, swoosh, swipe! And ala-presto ka-bam, like magic, they are perfect and dust-free! I just need one of these for my floors! I love, love, love how the sponge picks up everything, and with a little running water, all the dust, hair, muck, and guck just rinsed away! This will not disappoint! Thank you!" —DayDreamerGet it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in five color packs).
4. A set of glass jars with bamboo lids and included labels so you can star in your very own restocking TikTok — even if it's just pretend. Plus, they'll look so neat and organized in your bathroom or on your vanity, and you won't have to rifle through your medicine cabinet next time you need a cotton swab.www.amazon.comThe set of 12 labels includes six blank ones so you can write your own, and six pre-written with various bathroom needs (Cotton Balls, Cotton Swabs, Cotton Pads, Hair Ties, Floss Picks, Bath Salt).Promising review: "These are actually cuter than I expected! They are a tad smaller than some I've seen, but they actually looked great and can hold plenty of cotton swabs and cotton balls in the spare bathrooms. I have mine on a serving tray with a candle and vase, and they look great without taking up too much space!" —tara savageGet the set of four jars from Amazon for $9.99.
5. Bioclean, a hard water stain remover for everyone who is just tired of trying to clean those cloudy glass shower doors, spot-covered fixtures, tile and grout, and more. It even works on pools! If you're not convinced, just hear from one reviewer: "Step one: Look at the pictures. Step two: Buy a lifetime supply immediately." www.amazon.comPromising review: "Wow. Don’t waste your time with any other formulation that you found online. I’ve literally tried EVERYTHING! The soap/vinegar/baking soda, the expensive store-bought 'hard water cleaners.' I’ve scrubbed for HOURS! But this…. This product is like magic. It’s kind of like a paste that you can rub on with a microfiber towel, and the hard water stains literally just RUB OFF. Like butter! Seriously, the easiest option I have tried yet. I stopped within the first five minutes of cleaning to do this review because I’m in shock lol. Coming from someone who never writes reviews! Take that as a sign to buy this immediately. What a game changer, I’m mad I’m just now finding this stuff lol!" —_kayla_carterGet it from Amazon for $23.77.
6. A retro acrylic beauty organizer *with a lid* if you hate the messy look of open storage solutions (that also make it much harder to dust!). This'll look gorgeous sitting out on your bathroom counter or vanity while neatly organizing all your fave skincare and makeup products. No clutter, no problem.AmazonI have this organizer and I love it! It holds a good amount of stuff, keeps the dust at bay, and looks much neater than my old organizer, which just had slots with no lid. Because I regularly try a ton of beauty products, I paired it with a set of stacking drawers from another seller, which aren't a perfect match for the shade of green, but look good together on my vanity!Promising review: "I had all of my makeup in trays in my bathroom. It was difficult to keep organized and always seemed dusty, almost like the area was a dust magnet. I got this, and my bathroom looks so amazing now. It is easy to find what I am looking for, and all of my stuff is protected from dust. The clear lids on the top help keep the area looking wonderful, but also help me find what I am looking for. The drawers are nice to keep eyeshadow, and the top is wonderful for lotions and makeup brushes. The lipstick thing is wonderful for standard lipsticks — longer sticks like Revlon Color Stay do not fit, they are too tall for the lid to close. I ordered the green one, and the color looks beautiful on my bathroom counter." —LisaGet the set, which comes with the larger organizer and a smaller organizer for brushes, from Amazon for $54.99 (also available without the brush organizer for $48.99; available in four colors).
7. A reusable microfiber Swiffer mop pad if you'd like to cut down your use of disposable mopping pads...without cutting down on the efficacy of your clean. Reviewers actually think these pick up more than the disposable ones (especially pet hair and crumbs), and clean up easily right in the washing machine, so your floors can stay spotless as much as you'd like.www.amazon.comPromising review: "I bought these for the same reasons most do — to be more environmentally friendly. I like the size of my Swiffer Sweeper, but I always felt like I wasn't getting my floors fully clean. We recently got a new apartment, and I always like to deep clean before we do any major moving. I used them dry and wet. I've always been disappointed with how the disposable pads from Swiffer (barely) picked up dog fur and crumbs, but as you can see in the picture, it picked up so much! This was already after using a traditional broom. Then, using them wet with diluted Mrs. Meyers cleaning concentrate — wow! The water was BLACK by the time I was all done with our downstairs area. They were so easy to Velcro on and off, wet or dry. Once I was all done, getting them off and doing a quick rinse wasn't hard at all. I love that I am supporting a small family business with all the convenience of Amazon. I will definitely buy again (if I ever have to). I am so excited to use these for years to come and have a cleaner house than I ever have before!!" —Kathryn WillerGet a two-pack from Amazon for $16.89.Psst — if you don't already have one, you can get a Swiffer Deluxe (it has a collapsible handle for compact storage!) on Amazon for $22.24!
8. Dawn Powerwash, a borderline magical spray-on dish soap that BLASTS through tough grease and baked-on messes with ease, so you never have to have a dirty pan "soaking" in the sink — such an eyesore. But it's not just for dishes — if you have a greasy range hood or backsplash that's bothering you, or you want to deep clean your cooktop or grill, this is *perfect* for that too, cutting through the toughest messes!AmazonJust spray on (don't add water until you rinse!) and wipe. I'm not joking when I say that the first time I used Dawn Powerwash on a lasagna pan, I almost cried. I will never be without it!Promising review: "This stuff is the bomb! I can't say enough good about this product. I got my stove top as clean as it was when new — the area around the burners had been impossible for me to get clean before. I also cleaned the inside glass window of the oven with minimal effort. Seriously, this stuff is amazing IMO." —Kim M.Promising review: "The only dish soap allowed in my household 😅 jk I have used other different types, and this is the only one that has worked amazingly in all my cleaning. Not only do I use it on my dishes, but to clean my bathroom, husband's grill, and everything else that needs a good cleaning." —Lizbeth LFGet the starter kit (with one reusable spray bottle and one refill) from Amazon for $8.44.
9. A set of Rubbermaid Brilliance containers to streamline your messy, cluttered food storage cabinet once and for all. Once you try them, you'll be ruined for your old containers. They're completely clear, shatter- and stain-resistant (no lingering tomato sauce stains!), leakproof, and have built-in venting lids to make mess-free reheating (no microwave splatters!) a breeze.AmazonAnd they're microwave-, freezer-, and dishwasher-safe, too. These are my very favorite containers — I got the 22-piece set to fully stock my kitchen last year, and now I never use my old containers!Promising review: "These plastic storage containers are robust and well constructed. They can even be shaken vigorously with soup in them without risking a leak. For convenience, they are completely microwave and dishwasher-safe and have held up to 50+ cycles by this point. The seal is significant in that it acts as a vapor barrier (you don't smell what's inside until you open it). Huge plus. Additionally, you can unlatch the handles while keeping the lid sealed on, exposing vent holes. This allows you to microwave the contents without having to cover the top or worry about splashing – ingenious design! They're also gorgeous looking (and this aesthetic holds up, they don't stain) to boot and stack well." —NicholasGet a set of five containers from Amazon for $25.99 (also available in smaller and larger sets). And we stan these because we use them! For more, read our full Rubbermaid Brilliance Containers review.
10. And a storage lid organizer you'll wish you bought years and years (and years) ago. It'll end the nightmare of trying to figure out which lid belongs to which container (or losing a lid...sigh) and put a stop to the cascade of containers that rains on your head when trying to find the right size. Virgos, rejoice!AmazonThe dividers are adjustable so you can customize your set depending on what size containers you have!Promising review: "I love, love, love this storage container. Sounds silly, but it changed my life. No longer do I have storage container Jenga! No more stuff falling out of the cabinet every time I open the cupboard. Now I can stack my lids in the organizer and my storage containers fit nicely on the shelf, and I have a lot of storage containers. I would definitely buy this again and again. Great product." —Laura H.Get it from Amazon for $14.49+ (available in four sizes and sets).
11. A genius Tineco 2-in-1 cordless vacuum and mop that does *both at the same time* (gasp), always uses clean water for mopping (dirty water goes in a separate tank), and is safe to use on sealed hard floors. And unlike regular mops, this guy retains 90% of dirty water, so your floors will be clean and dry in just minutes. Monica Gellar would be so excited by this.www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comIt also self-propels so you just need to steer, no hard pushing!Promising review: "I confess I can be a lackadaisical housekeeper, which is problematic, since my new dog sheds enough in a week for me to build an entire new dog. What's worse, vacuuming doesn't pick up a lot of his fur. This Tineco is magic, though. Not only does it pick everything up (dust, fur, hair, crumbs, Nature's Miracle, errant Cheerios), but because the wheels are motorized, vacuuming/mopping is a breeze. I get exhausted using my canister vac, but this thing is a blast to use. Here is what I've learned: I always use the 'extra water' feature, which seems to work better. I clean the dirty water holder and parts every time I empty it, and I run the self-clean cycle after every second emptying session. This means I can do my primary bath and my 10x12 TV room before self-cleaning and recharging for a little bit. Or I can do my kitchen and entryway, and hall before self-cleaning, or my living room. In other words, you're not going to do your whole house on one battery charge or without running the self-cleaning feature several times. Of course, the reason you have to run the self-cleaning so often is because this little beauty is picking up So. Much. Stuff. It's magic. If it broke tomorrow (and I don't think it will break for a very long time) I would buy another." —TsippiGet it from Amazon for $199.99.
12. Or for automatic mopping only, the Shark Steam & Scrub steam mop with two rotating microfiber pads (they deliver 150 ~scrubs per minute~), easy maneuvering, and headlights built in so you can see every stuck-on particle and sticky stain that's in your path before it gets wiped away. There's no cleaning solution involved, but the steam sanitizes your floors!www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comIt's safe to use on all sealed floors, including hardwood, marble, tile, and stone.Promising review: "I hate mopping. I love the Shark Steam and Scub. I have tried many different products over the years, always looking for an easier way to mop. The steam and scrub is by far the easiest product I’ve ever used. I was able to clean all my tile rooms in less than an hour. The power and steam were perfect, and having the long cord was great. When I washed the pads in the washer, they came out like new. I highly recommend this product." —ArizonaPromising review: "I have four kids and two dogs and have struggled to keep my hardwood floors looking clean. This steamer takes minutes to use. It warms up in seconds and instantly has my floors spotless and without excess water. They dry quickly. Then simply throw the cleaning pads into the wash on a gentle cycle and air dry. I wish I had bought this years ago!!" —ValerieGet it from Amazon for $149.99.
13. A wall-mounted rack to keep your broom, Swiffer, and mop out of the dust before they can even sweep it up. And now you can actually (::sheds tear::) walk into your broom closet or pantry without seeing all the handles going this way and that — out of sight, out of mind (until your next cleaning day, of course).www.amazon.comFreed up floor space = more room for storage bins!!!!!Promising review: "I have a small apartment, and the broom closet was always a mess, with the brooms hitting me in the face whenever I took the trash out. This saved me so much stress! The slots have little rollers and they move to fit just about any-size mop or broom. There are also little hooks that can drop down if you want to hold towels or the dustpan, which is what I use it for. This is a must-have organizational tool!" —Jacqui NibbelinGet it from Amazon for $12.74.
14. A set of bed bands that will keep your fitted sheets neatly tucked under your mattress, if that ~loose~, wrinkly feeling keeps you up at night (honestly, same). Now you'll sleep more comfortably *and* be able to make your bed wayyyy faster in the morning. And as any self-proclaimed neat freak knows, making your bed is really the best way to start a productive day.www.amazon.comPromising review: "I have a pillow-top and pillow-bottom queen-sized bed that is a little too small for king sheets, and with queen sheets, I have battled to keep the sheets from popping off. I have tried everything! I was about to try to customize some king sheets because it was so frustrating. Then I saw this product advertised on Facebook in one of those posts about the amazing products that people love. So I figured it was worth a try. It works. I was shocked. My sheets have not popped off once. I ordered this in February, and it is May now — and they have not popped off once! They used to pop off EVERY...SINGLE...NIGHT. To say this is life-changing is not an exaggeration. Such a relief to be able to sleep through the night without ending up in rumpled sheets." —TinkerbellAPixieGet a set of four from Amazon for $13.99 (available in three colors and two sizes).
15. The Chom Chom, because it's every pet-owning neat freak's dream that shedding simply...didn't exist. And this genius roller is the closest we can possibly get to that dream. It has a patented brush design (and *no* adhesive strips) to rid your lovely black sofa of all your furry friend's shedding in just a quick roll! All the hair will bunch up inside the roller, ready to be dropped into the trash with the push of a button.www.youtube.comPromising review: "The best day of my life was the day I adopted my cat. The second-best day of my life was when I discovered this product. I never write reviews, but for the first time in my life, I felt compelled to write one to share how fantastic this product is. It’s the age-old story: girl adopts cat, cat sheds like a maniac, everything girl owns is now covered cat hair, girl tries everything but is unsuccessful, blah blah blah. But this pet hair remover/lint roller contains some type of wizardry that has seriously changed the game. *Chefs kiss* to the creators of this product. Y’all are doing G-d’s work." —SBGet it from Amazon for $24.99 (also available in black).
16. And Rocco & Roxie's odor-eliminating spray, an enzyme-based potion that feeds on the stains *and* stinks your pets leave behind (we love our pets! we love their messes...less) on tons of surfaces, including carpet, flooring, furniture, litter boxes and kennels, and more. If it weren't for all the cuddles, no one would even know a dog or cat lived in your house!AmazonPromising review: "Very hard to find ANY fault in this amazing product. It's easy to use and smells very fresh! I have a rug under our dining table where our Chow likes to tinkle pretty regularly. I was cleaning with a steam carpet cleaner at least once a week — and avoiding the rug altogether most of the time — but the smell never went away, and neither did our Chow, even after using Arm & Hammer carpet deodorizer! But a few sprays of Rocco & Roxie Stain & Odor Eliminator and POOF! Smell is ALL GONE, and Chow has lost interest. I give this product 5 STARS, but it honestly deserves more than that! Will buy again for certain!" —ICHGet it from Amazon for $21.77 (also available in a "light lemon" scent).
17. A Scrub Daddy sponge, because it is one of the all-time greatest Shark Tank hits for a reason, and the ultimate tool for cleaning enthusiasts. All the Sharks (except Lori, of course) may have laughed at first, but this smiley lil' guy just plain works on whatever mess you need to clean up — and almost 50,000 5-star reviewers agree.Amazon, www.amazon.comIf you don't know what makes a Scrub Daddy different from other sponges, let me tell ya: it's firm in cold water (for tougher messes) but soft in warm water (for lighter cleaning). The scratch-free material is safe on tons of surfaces: glass, stainless steel, cast iron, nonstick, chrome, copper, etc. And if you thought the face was just a gimmick, think twice — the eye and smile holes are great for quickly cleaning large and small utensils!Promising review: "These Scrub Daddies are the best thing to happen to sponges since the first person looked at a live sponge and said, 'I bet I could make one of those without killing a living sponge.' They don't smell! They clean like wizardry. And they last and last and last! I ordered these for the first time at my apartment, and I've ordered them again for vacation. Helpful tip: Great for cleaning knives. This may give you a shudder, but I just stick the knife into the Scrub Daddy's mouth and pull it out...like licking the cake batter off the knife, but never getting cut! Scrub Daddies are INVINCIBLE and AWESOME!" —J. BogdanoveGet a pack of five on Amazon for $18.99.
18. And Scrub Daddy sponge holder to keep your very favorite cleaning tool suctioned to the side of your sink, ready to tackle any grimey task you want to throw his way. He'll drip-dry right in the sink between uses without leaving a mess all over your counter (ew!) *and* the area around your sink will look so much better free of clutter.www.amazon.comPromising review: "Finally, a nice place to keep my Scrub Daddy. Holds great on the side of the sink. The suction power is strong for its size, and it rotates with ease. This is a good holder for the price." —Luis peralezGet it from Amazon for $7.99. Storage Theory is a small business that specializes in unique storage solutions for every room in your home.
19. A minimalist silverware tray that'll help you save drawer space and keep the cutlery from becoming ~clutter-y~. This is so easy to keep organized, even your messy roommate/partner/family member won't mess it up when they put silverware away, so you don't scream in frustration every time you open the drawer.AmazonIt also comes in a version just for knives.Promising review: "I thought this would be handy, and help with space management in a small apartment. It turned out to be absolutely perfect. It keeps the silverware clean and stores a lot in a very small space. I love it. I got two, because I inherited my grandmother's silverware, so there are two types of forks and two types of spoons, and I wanted things separate and organized. Two organizers fit side-by-side in a standard apartment drawer. After getting these, I picked up the knife organizer, and it’s just as handy and useful." —JerimiGet it from Amazon for $10.99.
20. An adhesive cord organizer you can stick right on any appliance that has an annoying plug that's a total eyesore or gets in your way — from your coffee machine to your vacuum, fan, or more. Ah, so much neater!AmazonCheck out a TikTok of the cord organizer in action. Promising review: "I got this for my minimalist husband who hates getting 'things' for gifts, almost as much as he hates clutter. He was practically giddy after we installed several of these on various kitchen appliances. It’s not just storage — but moving the appliance around from its storage location to the countertop is a nicer experience. He was seriously swinging around a food processor with one hand saying, 'This is so much neater!' To each their own I suppose. For us normies, it does exactly what it’s supposed to. Easy to stick on, I like that it holds the plug neatly as well. I would love if it came in white, but the gray is a nice neutral." —Elizabeth L. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $10.95 (or a four-pack for $19.95). Tidywrap is a small business established in 2022 that specializes in adhesive cord organizers. Note: these are meant for use on appliances only; the adhesive is removable, but may harm paint or wallpaper upon removal.
21. A sink cleaner and polish formulated to use on stainless steel AND porcelain sinks (plus cast iron, corian, acrylic, and more) to restore that just-like-new shine *and* protect against further damage. It creates a water-repellant barrier, so instead of your morning coffee, lunchtime soup, and evening pasta sauce just sitting in the bottom of the sink, it'll actually rinse clean with ease. www.amazon.comI bought this for my white porcelain kitchen sink, and I've texted five people about it, which is really a lot for such a boring grown-up product. It cleans beautifully, but the *best* thing about it is its ability to repel stains after cleaning. You know that thing when you rinse out your coffee cup and the coffee water just lingers in your sink, and you have to purposefully rinse it out for two minutes? You don't have to do that — the coffee can't stick to the sink and just goes RIGHT down the drain. Time saved, sink clean — this is really a Virgo dream product right here.Promising review: "I only WISH I had waited to use this until I could have taken a 'before' pic to go with the 'after' one of my 14-year-old sink. This cleaner is incredible. My cleaning person came on Wednesday, but the sink still looked dingy on Thursday with some persistent areas of discoloration and staining. It gets a lot of hard use. Now, five minutes following application of the product with a sponge, a bit of a scrub, and a quick rinse, it looks new. I’ve ordered this for both married kids for stocking stuffers. WORKS as promised. Not kidding. Wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t just done it myself and seen the eye-popping results. Quit reading reviews and BUY this stuff! (Read the cautions carefully regarding what kinds of surfaces are appropriate for use of product and which ones to avoid, but on regular stainless steel sinks, it’s honestly perfect.)" —EdUK8Get the value size from Amazon for $29.95 or the smaller size for $9.95.
22. A Furemover rubber broom made of ~electrostatic~ rubber that's designed to attract and trap dust and hair. Despite the name, it isn't just for those with shedding pets (although it's great for that) — as one of my BuzzFeed shopping colleagues knows firsthand, it's also great at getting *human* hair out of carpet in just a few quick sweeps (once you realize how much hair is trapped there...you'll never be able to un-know it). You'll be surprised how much more vibrant and clean-looking your carpets and rugs will be!BuzzFeed / Emma LordIt works on all floor types, but is *especially* great on carpet. *And* it has a built-in squeegee, great for cleaning up spills on hard surfaces.Promising review: "I use this on my wood floors and my rugs. I have three big dogs that shed like [wild]. It is the perfect shape and size to fit anywhere to get the fur trapped under couches, tables, etc. As soon as I got it, I tried it out, and my jaw dropped at how well it worked. It's completely made of rubber and molded so it won't fall apart." —BrittneyPromising review: "This is the best $13 I’ve ever spent in my life. I’ve had it for three days, and I’ve told like 37 people about it. I don’t have carpet in my house, but I have rugs and hardwood floors, and giant German shepherd hair tumbleweeds. I’m not kidding; I felt like I was swimming in dog hair! I was sweeping with a regular broom multiple times a day, and it felt like I was trapped in a fur dust storm. My allergies were begging me to find a solution. I bought ALL the vacuums and blew up every single one of them, including an actual Shop-Vac. This thing somehow magically attracts all the dog hair and dirt in a neat little pile. I will buy this again and again until I die." —Kimber LeighGet it from Amazon for $19.59 (available in six other types/styles).
23. A laundry folding board that'll take your already-good folding skills to the NEXT level. In just a few quick moves, every piece of clothing will become perfectly neat and crisp, and (bonus) take up less room in your drawers, closet, and even your suitcase on your next trip.Amazon, www.amazon.comPromising review: "Let me start off with this: I hate folding laundry. I absolutely hate it. I've seen this thing all over social media. I decided to try it out and OH. MY. GOSH. I freaking love it! It's super easy to use, and my clothes are perfectly folded every time. As weird as it sounds, I actually look forward to folding my laundry now. I wish I had purchased this sooner! I like the design it has, and I love how compact it is. After I'm finished folding my laundry, I just fold up the folding board and tuck it away! It's lightweight and seems durable. I recommend this to everyone, even those who hate folding clothes. I was skeptical at first, but after trying it out, I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and this product! It's worth every penny!" —KayliGet it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in five colors).
24. A spice *drawer* organizer so you can turn the messiest part of the kitchen into a clear, easy-to-read assortment of jars and labels. You'll save cabinet space AND never accidentally add cumin where you meant to add coriander again.AmazonSpice racks only *wish* they could. These drawer liners are made of a soft foam to keep your jars in the right position (label up!) so you can quickly grab what you need.

Name your mess, and this mildly abrasive paste will take care of business — including but not limited to bathroom tiles, sinks, stove tops, painted walls, grills, and outdoor furniture.www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comHow effective? Well, it's commonly likened to the Magic Eraser in paste form!Promising review: "This stuff is some magic sorcery. I’m not usually a fan of traditional cleaning products and tend to opt for natural-based cleaners. However, I had some soot over the fireplace that nothing would take off. Not only did it do a pretty dang good job on that…everything I’ve tried it on has gotten that item super clean with minimal scrubbing effort. Will always have on hand now. Got hard water stains off when CRL wouldn’t even get it clean and made the faucet look brand-new." —Kim MonteroGet it from Amazon for $5.97.

I just did my first use and it cleaned out so much gunk out of my shower that I didn’t even know was there!

Before all my items were in a drawer and the cords were a pain, but with this metal basket it minimized clutter, kept things organized and separate, and it also looks nice. It fits two of my blow dryers, a flat iron, and curling wand. The bars are adjustable as well(just use the twisties it came with to secure them in place, but the basket fit perfectly to my cabinet). Worth the buy. :)" —Alyssa JewellGet it from Amazon for $19.99.

A set of Shoe Slotz for any Carrie Bradshaw with way too many pairs of pumps to fit into an NYC-sized closet, or simply to make the most organized dream of any limited shoe storage you currently have.

31. Or a ~secret~ slim profile shoe cabinet, because even shoe racks might be too much visual clutter for you in your front closet or mudroom — and can make it harder for you to actually look through and wear your favorite shoes. Plus, it's actually such a chic piece of furniture!www.amazon.com, AmazonBtw, the image is of two of the cabinets next to each other! Promising review: "Love the shoe storage. Mostly bought for the look, not practicality. These fit sandals/anything flat like Birks, running shoes, and Air Forces fine, but anything taller won't fit. Six shoes total for one cabinet fit. Would buy again. Does as advertised and easy on the eyes." —mmajGet it from Amazon for $100.89+ (available in seven colors and with two or three drawers)
32. A bottle of Bar Keepers Friend soft cleanser (it's pre-mixed so it makes less of a mess than the original powder), because it's a cult-fave for a reason. Seriously. It works on SO. MANY. SURFACES — sinks, cookware, stainless steel, faucets, countertops, tubs, toilets, glass, grout, and more — so you can get to work and see results with only one product. www.amazon.comPromising review: "This stuff works so well that it *almost* makes cleaning the tub fun! I bought it to get rid of some rust, not knowing that it also removes soap scum. This stuff removed gunk that I was positive had become part of the tub. It doesn't have an overpowering smell, doesn't need to "soak" for very long at all, and barely requires scrubbing. I was able to clean with a cut-up old dish rag — no scrubbing surface. Lastly, as a Packaging Engineer, I have to give a shout-out to the great packaging. The bottle reminds me of the ketchup bottles that came out a few years back that actually propel the product when squeezed. I was able to apply a thin coat, getting full coverage without being wasteful. Will definitely buy this stuff again!!" —paxawPromising review: "Spectacular! We had quartz countertops installed in our home about six months ago. I noticed that the hard water stains were starting to develop, just like they had on the granite in our previous house. I used my new Bar Keepers Friend cleaner in both bathrooms, and I am completely amazed at how well it worked with so little effort. The stains were accumulating around the faucet-- now the stains have disappeared, and the countertop looks brand new again, with just one application. So quick and easy. I wish I had had it years ago. I love it!!!!" —BurkeGet it from Amazon for $2.89.Check out our first-hand review of Bar Keepers Friend original *and* the soft cleansing liquid for more deets and photographic ~evidence~.

And when the microfiber pad is dirty, just rinse and reuse!Promising review: "Buy it NOW. Honestly, I had huge reservations for this thing. Yet another miracle cleaning tool that will break or bend or something. I was so wrong. It was easy to put together and I sprayed it with Mean Green and went to the baseboards. No more kneeling and no broken back. This thing is amazing. It is durable and the pad is super absorbent. I am so happy. I can't wait to do the rest of the house!" —artgirlGet it from Amazon for $24.99.
34. And for wayyyyy up high surfaces (including the ceiling fan), an extendable (it'll reach over five feet!) duster that'll get the job done in no time flat, no matter where the dust bunnies are hiding. It can rotate and bend at multiple angles, and it even has a microfiber head you can toss in the wash and reuse.AmazonIt can rotate and bend at multiple angles, and it even has a microfiber head you can toss in the wash and reuse.Promising review: "Works very well. The telescoping handle has a super long reach when extended all of the way. There is nowhere in my home I can't reach with this. The duster really grabs and holds onto cobwebs and dust. I cleaned my ceiling fans without dust falling onto me and the floor below. There is also a rubber tip at the end of the duster that keeps it from scratching or marring surfaces which I thought was very nice. My only complaint is that I wish the rubber handle at the end was attached a bit better. It pulls totally off every time I extend the arm, but that's a very simple fix and doesn't really affect it's performance." —Julia ShaferGet it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in six colors).
35. Washing machine cleaning tablets that'll blast away any hidden mold or mildew, meaning your towels will come out of the wash smelling like clean laundry, not mysteriously stinky. They don't just clean the drum, but in all the places you can't see or reach, like the washer pump, valve, agitator/filter, and drain hose.www.amazon.comPromising review: "These tablets added to the cleaning cycle of my front-load machine are far more effective than hot water alone. They effectively clean and reduce/eliminate mildew odors, which build up no matter how much I air out the machine after doing laundry. Just toss one into the basket when the cleaning cycle alert comes on, and your washing machine will love you for it." —Tami T.Get a pack of six from Amazon for $10.98.
36. And a cleaning gel designed to help you banish that icky growth on your front-loading washing machine gasket (just take a peek at yours right now, I dare ya). Let it sit for a few hours or overnight, and then just wipe away with a damp cloth — all gone!www.amazon.comYou can also use it in your bathroom!Promising review: "I used this product on the rubber gasket on my front load washing machine and also on the white caulk on my kitchen and bathroom sinks. Let me tell you, this stuff works amazing! There is very little smell and it is very easy to apply since its a gel consistency. I needed to apply this twice to my washing machine since the mold was harder to come out. But it really was able to remove the yucky black mold that I had previously had a lot of trouble removing! So happy to see clean and mold free surfaces. AMAZING STUFF!" —L.C.Get it from Amazon for $9.99.

And it works like a charm; the floors always look great afterward and there's no rinsing necessary." —JessPromising review: "I own a house-cleaning business, so I am always looking for the best products. I've tried many products (including non-green products in my own home) and this is my absolute favorite. Many wood floor cleaners leave a film and can be sticky, but not this. Just squirt and mop. I've tried the other Method scents and they work great, but the almond is my favorite. My clients always rave about the scent and often ask what I use and where to get it. Absolutely love this!" —Jamie ParsonsGet it from Amazon for $12.09.

Use it on glass shower doors, mirrors, glass coffee tables, and wherever else streaks accumulate — and definitely use it on your windows so you can actually enjoy the view outside!SpraywayPromising review: "I love everything about it. Being a former housekeeper, this is the best quality glass cleaner. No streaks. It absolutely leaves your glass shiny and clean." —UrsiePromising review: "Streaks be gone! A house cleaning service left this over at my house once, and I have been [obsessed] ever since. I will never use a liquid glass cleaner again. This goes on as a light mist or foam and wipes off streak-free. I personally use a terry cloth, but it truthfully doesn't matter. It works well, in general, and one spray can goes a long way. So this price for THREE is a bargain deal, if I've ever seen one. Also, props to the supplier for shipping safely as well. I'll definitely purchase it again." —Mista_TGet it from Amazon for $7.77 (also available in a four-pack).

And unlike similar options, reviewers promise the flocking does *not* come off of these and all over your clothes. Promising review: "These hangers do all the work for me. I was finally inspired to rid myself of flimsy, tacky dry cleaner hangers and bulky plastic ones — I’d have to size up my clothes in order to determine which ones wouldn’t slide off the plastic. With these hangers, everything works, and the velvet is like an easy-to-use magnet for my clothes. Nothing slips. The space-saving design makes a surprising difference. I share a small master closet, and thanks to these hangers, my side is roomy and organized now." —E. MarshallGet a set of 50 from Amazon for $31.99 (available in 10 colors).

I moved into a brand new apartment complex that was just built, and after being there for a week with three cats, I decided to vacuum the carpet and rugs. TO SAY MY JAW DROPPED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

Then I bought this, and he’s like Tim 'the tool man' Taylor. I guess he just needed more power??? He cleans the bathroom without even being asked because he likes the drill brushes. They work well. The grout lines are clean. It doesn’t take him long. Best money I've ever spent! LOL." —Heather NGet it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in six brush types for different surfaces).Drill Brush is a small business based in New York.

Drop it in, run your disposal, and you're done.AmazonPromising review: "Do you have a stinky garbage disposal? If so, get some of these. They are cheap, smell nice. And the foaming action really provides you with a visual they are cleaning the drain. After using these the garbage disposal seems smoother (fewer strange noises, like it's been lubricated). I'd recommend these over Plinks any day as I feel the Plinks only hide smells whereas these foaming packets actually clean the disposal."—SugacookieGet a pack of four from Amazon for $7.50.

I love my glass top stove, but cleaning it is not as easy as just wiping it down. If you have one, you know how it is when something boils over or spills. This bakes whatever hits the glass and leaves those frustrating scorch marks. No matter how hard I scrubbed, I could never get the film off. I have tried every cleaning product, as well as every home remedy suggestion, and it never removes the marks. I came across this product on Amazon and, after reading the reviews, thought, 'Why not?' Ah, all is good in the world after finding this. I put a quarter-size dot of Cerama Bryte, scrubbed it with a light scratch pad, and rainbows and unicorns came dancing. Ah, so shiny. I think I’ve invested 20+ labor hours trying to clean the stove top, and just gave up. With this product, it took me five minutes.
