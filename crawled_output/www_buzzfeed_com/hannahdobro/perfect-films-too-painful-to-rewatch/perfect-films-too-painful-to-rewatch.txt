Reddit user hasan1808ali recently asked, "What movie is a 10 out of 10 for you, but you'll never watch again?" The thread quickly filled with movies people found extremely poignant, moving, disturbing, devastating, flawless, and excruciating. Here's what they revealed:
1.
"Saving Private Ryan. War is horrible, and this film is true to life. I saw it in a packed theater, and when it ended, nobody spoke or moved from their seat for about 20 seconds."

—weulz"My fiancé told me that his grandpa had to walk out of the theater because of how real it felt and that there were other veterans who did the same thing."—chocotacogato"I was a preteen when this movie came out. The theaters were PACKED with WWII vets, and many of them were crying and had to take a moment to leave the theater. I remember the local news interviewing these VFW guys who saw it together, and one of them said it was so real he could smell the blood and sand during the opening scene. There was never a war movie like this one before. It led the way to real-life styled war movies. WWII movies leading up to this were cheesy John Wayne-type movies."—NotBannedAccount419
2.
"Manchester by the Sea. It was hard to watch before I had kids. Now, there is no way I could sit through that."
Roadside Attractions /Courtesy Everett Collection
—ThatGuy7320"It was just so good. I watched it after already having kids; that was tough. I've never watched someone play somebody that broken so painfully accurately."—Trilex88"It was just brutal. It portrays the grieving process on screen so vividly."—rh51too
3.
"Bridge to Terabithia. Shocking twist. Never again."
Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection
—Raqonteur"The fact they marketed that as a kids movie…"—Sleepy_Doge97"Oh my god. A girlfriend had me watch this with her because she grew up on it. And I was having such a good time until…you know…and I asked her, 'Why would you do that to me?' She said, 'Because everyone needs to see it once and not see it coming.' Like, what? That kind of gave me trust issues, haha."—LightspeedBriefs25
4.
"Uncut Gems. The movie gave me so much stress."
A24 / courtesy Everett Collection
—LordVoldeySnort"This was going to be my response as well. A movie has never made me feel such a way before. I left the theater feeling emotionally drained."—ntmrkd1"Something about watching someone make the wrong decision time and time again is just so hard to watch."—Impossible_Cycle9460"It is a good movie, and still my reaction at the end felt like, 'Thank god that's over.'"—DianaMasters"It's supposed to make you feel stressed, and it accomplishes this to great effect. One of the best acting performances by Adam Sandler, nonetheless. Hard recommend if you've never seen it, but I can't wait to never watch it again."—Steezmoney"My hand actually cramped from tension. It was sooo good but so uncomfortable."—dapala1
5.
"The 2009 film The Lovely Bones. Overall, a great movie. Original plot, great acting, and all that. But it messed me up for days. Man, now I'm thinking about it again."
Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection
—Fickle-Bullfrog9005
6.
"The Green Mile. It broke my heart."
Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection
—grac3ie"I watched it with my wife the other night. We agreed to never go through that ordeal ever again."—Kythorne
7.
"The Shawshank Redemption is a solid 10/10, incredible story, amazing performances, and an all-around masterpiece. But honestly, I don't think I'd ever watch it again because the impact the first time was just too powerful to replicate. Sometimes a movie is perfect as a one-time experience."
Columbia Pictures / courtesy Everett Collection
—brainstorm422
8.
"Life is Beautiful. I feel like a lot of Holocaust movies are like this. Masterpieces, but absolutely horrific and grim. They are important to see, but I do not blame anyone for not wanting to watch them again. Life is Beautiful stuck with me. We watched it in school, and everyone was crying. The out-of-sight gunshot destroyed me."

9.
"The Substance. I watched it with a friend and told her at about the halfway point, 'I will never be watching this movie again.' My husband watched it with us, too, but had to stop and couldn't finish it. 10/10 movie though, highly recommend."

"Atonement. I don't think I emotionally recovered from the first watch."
Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection
—Insert-Username5111"I will never ever see that again, and I still have a hard time seeing Benedict Cumberbatch in anything."—twiggyrox
11.
"Requiem for a Dream. Fantastic score and impactful story. Depressing AF, though."
Artisan Entertainment /Courtesy Everett Collection
—mirostgo"It was powerful, and the first time a friend helped me define if a movie is 'good.' I mentioned that I didn't think it was good because it left me feeling so shaken up and depressed. He pointed out that it still means a movie is 'good' if it makes you feel something, and it doesn't necessarily need a happy ending. Made me think."—ProfessionalEnabler"Absolute masterpiece of a film. Fantastic writing, great acting, soul-crushing, and disturbing. I'll never watch it again unless it's with someone who has never seen it."—imthejavafox
12.
"Parasite. A few of the visuals still give me nightmares."

—TangyCornIceCream
13.
"A Clockwork Orange. A powerful movie, but the brutality hits in a way I can't handle."
Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection
—DonGar37"Oh god, yes. I will never rewatch this. I wish I hadn't seen it in the first place. This movie haunts me."—No_Banana_581
14.
"12 Years a Slave."
Fox Searchlight/Courtesy Everett Collection
—According-Apricot116"An incredibly important movie. So well done in craft, acting, and script. And I never need to put myself through that again."—HooverGaveNobodyBeer
15.
"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Great movie, but depressing as fuck."
Focus Films/Courtesy Everett Collection
—senseless2

"A Star is Born with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. Beautiful movie, great actors, beautiful story, well done, but never again will I watch it."
Clay Enos / Warner Bros / courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection

"The Northman. It shows how brutal life was 1,000 years ago. I was engaged the whole way through, but can't force myself to watch it again."
Focus Features / Courtesy Everett Collection
—ChargeConfident6015
18.
"Midsommar. I thought it was well executed and very original, but the last 10 minutes traumatized me like a child, and I'm 40 years old. You could not pay me to watch it again."
A24 / courtesy Everett Collection
—LarryZuckercornESQ"It's such an excellent movie that triggered every aspect of my social anxiety in the most spectacular way. I didn't even finish watching it as it was damn near inducing a panic attack, but I have recommended it to many people."—PineappleOk6764
19.
"Promising Young Woman. Vitally important and very well done, but that movie destroyed me."
Focus Features / Courtesy Everett Collection
—localstreetcat
20.
"We Need to Talk About Kevin. Whether or not you were feeling good before watching it, it's so stressful and painful, it will make you feel bad."
Oscilloscope Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection
—Isarn_Divio
21.
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a phenomenal movie, but the ending ruined me. I was a mess. It's a great movie, but I won't put myself through that ending again."
Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection
—Going_my_own_way73
22.
"Marley & Me."
20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection
—erick31"I watched this on a transatlantic flight, thinking it was a light movie about a cute puppy. Then, I proceeded to try to quietly ugly cry for 30 minutes."—MessyMaple"Went to see that on a first date. I haven't seen that movie or that guy since."—WhatWasMyAIMUsername"I'd already read the book, but my husband had no idea it was a true story. We both cried and vowed never to watch it again."—Opposite-Reality-891
23.
"Sinners. I watched it once, and I will never watch it again because it is literally a masterpiece."
Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection
—BuckTribe
24.
"Schindler's List. The ending with him breaking down about how he could have saved more just destroys me."
Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection
—DinosaurNerd_89"Walking out of that movie theater was the quietest I have ever heard a movie crowd be. You could have heard a pin drop. We were all just stunned. Great, great movie. Everyone should watch it once."—afcagroo"Yeah, same here. It's one of those films that's flawless in craft but emotionally wrecking."—FixMean7944
25.
"Mr. Nobody is possibly the best movie ever that is also impossible to watch again, let alone enjoy a second time."
Magnolia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection
—tonyjopet
26.
And: "Sophie's Choice. No other movie (some have come very close) has left me with such a gut-wrenching feeling that stayed with me a long time and gave me nightmares."
Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection
—Ok-Winner5074"Meryl Streep is absolutely mesmerizing, but as the parent of two children, I just can't handle 'the choice' and its aftermath."—wandering_nt_lost
