We have a few in the Midwest, but not like the ones from the '70s and '80s."by Claudia SantosBuzzFeed StaffFacebookPinterestLink
Even as a millennial, seeing how the dining landscape has changed is wild. I still remember my family being asked, "Smoking or non-smoking?" when going out to eat. A while ago, redditor lordofedging81 asked the r/AskOldPeople community to share the iconic restaurant experiences they grew up with that no longer exist. Here are some of their nostalgic memories from dining out in the '70s and '80s.
1.
"I miss when Pizza Hut had dining rooms with dark, plastic Tiffany hanging lamps over each table and those plastic red cups."

—DareWright"Pizza Hut is permanently etched into my brain. It was such a treat to go there. The smell of pizza when you walked in the door, the tablecloths, and the plastic red cups."—SaintOlgasSunflowers
2.
"Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour. Whenever someone ordered a Zoo (a bowl with 20 scoops of ice cream, usually for parties), they'd bring it out on a stretcher-like item, carried by two people. And they'd ring a bell, blow a siren, make a racket, and run around the restaurant with it before bringing it to the table. If one person ate a whole Zoo, there was an announcement accompanied by sirens, bells, etc. Every trip to Farrell's was sure to include multiple loud interruptions to the meal. It was a blast."
—DanaMorrigan
3.
"The cigarette machine in the lobby/waiting area."

—wifeage18"And you could push a button for matches in the 1960s. That's how 8-year-olds like me got matches to play with."—Comprehensive_Post96
4.
"I remember a lot more locally owned restaurants and fewer chains. When you were on vacation, there would be all these different local restaurants, and you would have to ask around to find the best ones. And you would get food different from what you would have at home. Now, every town seems to have the same chains, and the restaurants and the food are all the same."

5.
"A small jukebox at your table to insert your quarter and choose three songs."

—smaartypants"One of my favorite memories! When I was a kid, we'd go to a diner on Sundays with the little jukebox at the table, and I'd play "Heartbreak Hotel" every time. Whenever I hear that song, I'm right back in that booth."—zereldalee
6.
"Salad bars — a lot of restaurants had salad bars in the 1980s. Now, I can't think of one locally."
—reesesbigcup"I think COVID helped kill salad bars and buffets."—MKEJOE52
7.
"Arcade games in pizza joints."

—mzjjobe"Arcade games in general! When was the last time you saw a Street Fighter or other game at any local store?! I've been to some laundromats with old, grubby, and often broken machines, but outside of deals like that, it's like they just completely disappeared!"—ThaneRob
8.
"A smoking section."
—None"My first job was as a hostess at a restaurant: 'Smoking or non-smoking?'"—tsapat
9.
"Cafeterias in discount stores. K-Mart had a delicious orange drink that I absolutely loved. And I'd go to Woolworths for a burger, fries, and a chocolate shake."

10.
"Howard Johnson's fried clams. Where did they get them? Why can't anyone imitate them? It's been decades, and I'm still grieving."
—Vtfla
11.
"Matches with the restaurant's name embossed on them, by the register, next to the mints."

12.
"A basket with all different varieties of crackers and breadsticks to go with your cup or bowl of soup."
—lldurado"I loved that, especially the rye crackers. The local place we went to also had salad dressing in a little metal thing with three bowls. I thought it was so swanky."—normalnonnie27
13.
"When McDonald’s deep fried their pies. (Pro tip: McDonald’s in Hawaii still does.)"

14.
"Shakey's Pizza, where you could see them throw the crusts and watch old-time movies while you ate. Later, they had great buffets."
—WAFLcurious"My siblings and I are all in the 55–60 range, and we still wax poetic about our memories of Shakey's and Farrell's (mentioned elsewhere in this list)."—remberzz
15.
"You used to get a few sprigs of parsley on your plate. You weren't supposed to eat it. It was for decoration."

—nolotusnote"I almost never see that anymore, but it was everywhere. And it had a horrible texture and was so hard to chew! But like you said, it wasn't supposed to be eaten."—lordofedging81
16.
"I was a manager at one of the last Steak and Ales in the country. I remember the ambiance, the engagements, the graduations, the celebrations. I remember the prime rib, the Hawaiian chicken, the stained glass, the Queen Anne chairs, the kitsch, the people. Twenty-five years later, I still see people in town and know their order is a 10-ounce prime rib and a baker with butter, sour cream, and chives. I don't know their names but know their order forever."
—RosesSpins
17.
"I remember the taco bar at Wendy's."

—ciscovet"Ooh, I remember it fondly! Ours had a taco bar in the middle, with an Italian section on one side with different kinds of pasta and marinara and then a vast salad bar on the other. They also had a few desserts at the end of the salad bar, and my favorite was always the pudding. It tasted just like a frosty, but it was pudding — blew my mind as a little kid!"—DietPepsiCamel
18.
"Way back in the '70s, they used to have sugar packets with pictures of fancy cars on them. I used to collect them. I don't know what happened to them now."
—Mary_P914
19.
"A&W had drive-in service; they’d bring a tray out that attached to your window. I remember White Castle in Vancouver had trays that stretched window to window across the car in the late '80s."

"Cafeterias are a dying breed. We have a few in the Midwest, but not like the ones from the '70s and '80s. My mom (73) still likes to go to one every other Sunday with us and all her grandkids. It's nice watching my kids 'go through the line' and pick out a pie or cake from the plethora of desserts."
—Ingybalingy1127
21.
"Pancho's Mexican restaurants with the flag on the table you raised when you needed more food! I loved that flag, especially when it was my turn to raise it. Ah, memories!"

—Proud-Butterfly6622"Raise the flag! Raise the flag! You're ready for a little more Pancho's! I can still hear the jingle in my head all these years later."—wallybeavis
22.
"When I was a kid in the '70s, many restaurants had paper placemats that were cocktail menus. There'd be photos of each cocktail with fun names like Singapore Sunset, Grasshopper, Pink Lady, Monkey's Kiss, etc. They looked so good, and I couldn't wait to grow up and order them all one day. But sadly, those menus had long gone by the time I was old enough to drink."

And finally: "Ponderosa! You'd grab your tray and silverware and work your way through the line to order your food and pay, then fill up on the food bar as they cooked your food to bring to your table."
