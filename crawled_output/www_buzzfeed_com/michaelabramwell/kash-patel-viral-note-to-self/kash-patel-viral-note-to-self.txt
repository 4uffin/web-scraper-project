The note, scribbled in blue ink on a stationery titled "Director Patel," reads: "Good fight with Swalwell. Hold the line. Brush off their attacks. Rise above the next line of partisan attacks."

"Lmfao he's writing words of affirmation to himself," one person joked.
"I mean we didnâ€™t need to see this to know itâ€™s all that runs through his head," this person said.
This person said, "Maybe Kash Patel would be better at his job if he had, I donâ€™t know, statistics or analysis at his fingertips, rather than twelve year old boy style 'Iâ€™m such a big strong man' shit written on his pad."
