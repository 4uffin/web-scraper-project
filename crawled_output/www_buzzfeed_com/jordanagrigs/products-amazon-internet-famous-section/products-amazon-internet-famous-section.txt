Fun fact: Amazon has an "Internet Famous" section curated with TikTok-viral products. Here are a few of the current ones so beloved by reviewers that they are *definitely* worth the hype:
1. Medicube Deep Vitamin C Golden Capsule Face Moisturizer¬†to help oxidize, brighten, and smooth your complexion, giving you instant¬†and¬†lasting results. This jar of K-beauty magic is filled with lil' vitamin C and niacinamide-filled liposome capsules that'll *pop* and release all the goods into your skin. Oh, hang on, one sec, ‚ú®radiance‚ú® is calling.¬†Amazon, www.amazon.comPromising review: "This moisturizer is one of the nicest feeling moisturizers ever. The appearance of the vitamin C capsules inside the gel goop on TikTok enticed me to purchase it for myself. This moisturizer has a gel-like consistency and comes with a scooper, making it very easy to apply. You get a decent-sized jar of moisturizer for the price, and the moisturizer is pretty thick. Although it is sticky, I would say it absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It may leave a slightly sticky residue behind, but I think overall it is amazing for all skin types. After using this in the a.m. before sunscreen, I noticed my skin really glowed and felt smooth! I had gifted a jar to my 60-year-old mother and she had told me how her skin felt like a baby‚Äôs bum the next morning!" ‚Äîtracey + kiwiPrice:¬†$19.90¬†(available in two other styles)

I've even had to dump the canister after a couple of rooms.¬†The noise level is average compared to that of any other vacuum. Cleaning power is great, especially when you are pulling the vacuum back to you. The suction is next level! I love that I can take it apart and clean my stairs without lugging the entire system up and down. I have recommended this vacuum to friends. I've seen it on TikTok being used as a top choice among professional cleaners as well." ‚ÄîAshleyPrice:¬†$139.99+¬†(available in four colors/styles)

Promising review: "Amazing! I was using several little patches on large areas, and they just didn‚Äôt work that well. I put this patch on my chin and left it overnight, and was extremely pleased with the results. I had two little pimples and a bunch of hard-to-get blackheads. My chin has never been clearer. It basically feels like those clear waterproof Band-Aids, so it did not slide off during the night. I constantly have deep white and blackheads that my pimple tool can never tackle, so I am very pleased with these results! I was so surprised and a little grossed out that so much gunk was in my chin. I highly recommend these patches! Very easy to use and had amazing results." ‚ÄîErin BrownPrice: $17.97 for a 10-pack

Amazon
Promising review: "This is a game changer when it comes to rinsing rice and quinoa! If I tried to use a regular strainer, the rice would fall through the holes. Before buying this, I would usually just rinse the rice in a bowl and try to dump the water without losing any of the rice, and it was a pain! With the old method, my rice cooker would usually get pretty messy and spew all of the slimy stuff. Now that I use this to rinse the rice, my rice cooker is running like new again!

It‚Äôs truly a game-changer, and it‚Äôs now a permanent part of my skincare routine!" ‚ÄîAmy PredelusPrice: $18+ (available in two sizes)
