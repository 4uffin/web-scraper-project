Fun fact: Amazon has an "Internet Famous" section curated with TikTok-viral products. Here are a few of the current ones so beloved by reviewers that they are *definitely* worth the hype:
1. Medicube Deep Vitamin C Golden Capsule Face Moisturizer to help oxidize, brighten, and smooth your complexion, giving you instant and lasting results. This jar of K-beauty magic is filled with lil' vitamin C and niacinamide-filled liposome capsules that'll *pop* and release all the goods into your skin. Oh, hang on, one sec, ✨radiance✨ is calling. Amazon, www.amazon.comPromising review: "This moisturizer is one of the nicest feeling moisturizers ever. The appearance of the vitamin C capsules inside the gel goop on TikTok enticed me to purchase it for myself. This moisturizer has a gel-like consistency and comes with a scooper, making it very easy to apply. You get a decent-sized jar of moisturizer for the price, and the moisturizer is pretty thick. Although it is sticky, I would say it absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It may leave a slightly sticky residue behind, but I think overall it is amazing for all skin types. After using this in the a.m. before sunscreen, I noticed my skin really glowed and felt smooth! I had gifted a jar to my 60-year-old mother and she had told me how her skin felt like a baby’s bum the next morning!" —tracey + kiwiPrice: $19.90 (available in two other styles)

A Shark vacuum that seriously sucks, and I mean that in the best way possible. You'll be seriously impressed by the amount of dirt and crap that this thing picks up, but also mortified at the fact that your carpets were much dirtier than you'd ever thought.
amazon.com
Promising review: "Saw on TikTok and thought the amount of dust that this vacuum picked up was WILD. Every single time I use this vacuum, it pulls up so much from my carpet. I've even had to dump the canister after a couple of rooms. The noise level is average compared to that of any other vacuum. Cleaning power is great, especially when you are pulling the vacuum back to you. The suction is next level! I love that I can take it apart and clean my stairs without lugging the entire system up and down. I have recommended this vacuum to friends. I've seen it on TikTok being used as a top choice among professional cleaners as well." —AshleyPrice: $139.99+ (available in four colors/styles)
3.

I asked a co-worker what she was wearing because every day she smelled magnificent, filling the office. I am now on my third bottle, always receiving so many compliments on my perfume! I have a variety of perfumes I’ve spent hundreds on. This one is my everyday go-to over all of them! Truly smells awesome!" —Janika C.Price: $26.45 (available in other scents and multipacks)

amazon.com, amazon.com
Promising review: "The figurine is true to the stated size. I bought this to add to my gaming room as decor. It holds an iPhone 15 Pro, TV remote, or PS5 controller really well.

I wish I could find more figurines like this one!" —JamesPrice: $24.99

7.
A repelling umbrella cuz when Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande said "I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive," they didn't know this could give 'em the best of both worlds (minus Hannah Montana). Plus, it's made to withstand winds up to 85 mph, so you can't argue that this isn't a superior frightful weather barrier.
amazon.com
Promising review: "What I love most about it is its durability. Even on extremely windy days, it has consistently held its own without flipping inside out, which is truly remarkable. The automatic open and close function works smoothly, and the handle is comfortable to grip, making for a pleasant user experience. And, of course, it keeps me perfectly dry.If you're looking for a sturdy and compact umbrella, I highly recommend this one! It's perfect for travel and a reliable companion for everyday use." —Amazon CustomerPrice: $23.99+ (available in 15 colors and multipacks)
8. A gorgeous Nyx Butter Gloss that isn't sticky, which has got to be Alex Russo's work (IYKYK), because non-sticky gloss has got to be magic. If you couldn't snag the Nicolandria set that sold out in literally three hours (so sad, but so proud cuz that's tea, the influence our girl has!), get an Olandria level juicy pout with this beautiful, creamy gloss. Put it over your lipstick or wear it alone for glowy lips in seconds. www.amazon.com, Jordan Grigsby / BuzzFeedHey, hi, yes, that's me up there (on the right). This gloss is without a doubt my go-to. I have one in every purse I have. To say I can't live without it is an understatement (Yes, I'm fully aware that I'm dramatic). I love this gloss, and whenever IDK what lip to wear, this one always is my default. I have it in tons of colors, and every shade EATS. Plus, it's so cheap, you seriously can't go wrong. In the photo above, I'm wearing shades "Salty Coco" and "Spiked Toffee" mixed. Promising review: "TikTok made me buy this, and I am so glad I did. It feels so moisturizing, and the color fits my skin color so well. I could wear this all day; it lasts so well. Not tacky or too sticky. Will be buying more." —ShalyssaPrice: $4.80+ (available in 40 colors and in multipacks)

A 10-pack of large surface pimple patches to cover your chin breakout instead of using seven lil' dots to cover each pimple.
amazon.com, amazon.com
Promising review: "Amazing! I was using several little patches on large areas, and they just didn’t work that well. I put this patch on my chin and left it overnight, and was extremely pleased with the results. I had two little pimples and a bunch of hard-to-get blackheads. My chin has never been clearer. It basically feels like those clear waterproof Band-Aids, so it did not slide off during the night. I constantly have deep white and blackheads that my pimple tool can never tackle, so I am very pleased with these results! I was so surprised and a little grossed out that so much gunk was in my chin. I highly recommend these patches! Very easy to use and had amazing results." —Erin BrownPrice: $17.97 for a 10-pack

This is the most comfortable piece of clothing I have ever put on my body. This hoodie is like a warm hug on a cold, rainy day. I bought the light gray hoodie four days ago, and I have ordered two more since. If you feel you are missing something in life, I can tell you with 100% certainty that it is this hoodie. The fabric, the price, the fit can only be described as perfection." —DevinPrice: $22.99+ (available in women's sizes XXS–4XL and 43 colors).

Promising review: "Look, I can't tell the difference between these and more expensive frames. They're nicely made, and I can't tell that the plastic isn't glass, and I'd rather have plastic because sometimes my cats do parkour on the walls, and I do not want glass pieces all over again. How do they manage to knock things five feet up a wall...cats, amirite? It even came with a little tool to lift up those metal holder parts, which I super appreciate because those buggers are hard to lift.

Amazon
Promising review: "This is a game changer when it comes to rinsing rice and quinoa! If I tried to use a regular strainer, the rice would fall through the holes. Before buying this, I would usually just rinse the rice in a bowl and try to dump the water without losing any of the rice, and it was a pain! With the old method, my rice cooker would usually get pretty messy and spew all of the slimy stuff. Now that I use this to rinse the rice, my rice cooker is running like new again! Love it!" —40 kalPrice: $17.99

I keep my phone charging by my vanity now since I know the alarm clock will wake me, and I sleep more peacefully. Setting the time and alarm is easy. The numbers are large enough to see without my glasses, and I like the adjustable brightness. It doesn't give you a heart attack because the volume and frequency slowly ramp up. They're also reasonably priced. Highly recommend." —Elaine BPrice: $14.99+ (available in five colors)

Just the tiniest dot keeps my lips super soft and hydrated for hours, even through drinking and eating. The grapefruit smells great, but isn’t overwhelming. I’ll never go back to anything else." —Spectacle"TikTok made me buy, and I am not mad. This is my go-to lip gloss, and I definitely plan on buying more. I also didn’t realize I have the Laneige sleep mask I got from an Ipsy bag, and I would just like to say, this company's products are really good. One of my faves overall!!" —Nadine PerezPrice: $19 (available in nine scents and a bundle)
