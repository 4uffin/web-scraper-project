Back in 2023, actor Rachel Bilson revealed that she had been dropped by a brand after she spoke openly about sex during a podcast appearance.

In case you missed it, the star — who was 41 at the time — discussed her favorite sex positions on the Women on Top podcast, saying that she enjoys “missionary” because she likes to be “fucking manhandled.”

This quote was picked up by various media outlets, and Rachel later shared that it had serious repercussions in her professional life.
Speaking on her own podcast Broad Ideas later that same month, the star shared: “I lost a job this week because of things that were said and then spun in the press and clickbait headlines and whatnot.”

“I basically got a job that I already had pulled from me because I was speaking openly about sex,” Rachel said, going on to add that she was “baffled” by the company’s decision to cut ties. “A single mom, a woman, lost a job because they were being candid and honest and the subject was sex,” she reiterated. “I said it in a joking manner in the interview, like: ‘Yeah, I wanna get fucking manhandled.’ Basically, it's like, OK, give control or take control in the bedroom, whatever.” “Because that specific line was pulled and it made it sound a certain way, I didn’t even have a chance to defend myself. I didn’t have a chance to speak on it,” Rachel went on. “I’m a single mom, like, I need these jobs.”Rachel shares a now-10-year-old daughter with her ex, Hayden Christensen.
“Everything was set in motion, and I lost the job. It sucks,” she concluded, before standing her ground and saying that she maintains that she didn’t do anything wrong. “I haven’t said anything inappropriate. Choice of language… If I could go back, now knowing I lost a job, maybe I would say it differently. But I still wouldn't not say it.”

And now, two years later, Rachel has admitted that the troubling experience has led to her censoring herself during interviews as she reflected on the decision that the unnamed “very conservative company” made.

Discussing the incident on the Why Won’t You Date Me? podcast, Rachel said: “I definitely felt myself filtering a little after that. Like: 'Oh my god, if I say this, am I gonna lose this job? Am I gonna be judged? Shamed?'"

"Did I want to fight it? Absolutely,” she went on. “Look, I can see both sides. When you take something out of context and you read something as a standalone comment, it can come off a certain way, sure. You’re talking basically with girlfriends, and you’re joking around, and I said something like: ‘I like to be manhandled.’”

"Olivia [Allen], who cohosts Broad Ideas with me, her mom's, like, 83. She was like: 'I like to be manhandled!' You know? Like, everyone could relate,” Rachel joked. "But because I used that word in whatever context, they just took that out of the conversation. It didn't sound great."

“But I think it was a very conservative company, so they weren't comfortable talking about sex at all, in general,” Rachel admitted before reiterating: “We were joking around!"
