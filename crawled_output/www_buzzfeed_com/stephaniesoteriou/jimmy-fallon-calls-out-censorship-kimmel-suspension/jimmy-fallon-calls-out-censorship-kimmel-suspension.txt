As I am sure you know by now, Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, was suspended indefinitely by ABC and Disney on Wednesday, following comments Kimmel made about the death of Charlie Kirk on Monday’s show.

In case you missed it, Kimmel angered conservatives and triggered threats of penalties from the Federal Communications Commission Chair, Brendan Carr, when he suggested that the person who shot and killed Kirk is right-wing.

“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said on his show.

New footage shows Kimmel arriving at a Hollywood TV studio for his Wednesday show, only to leave without taping an episode.
Needless to say, the entire situation has sparked fierce backlash, with many concerned about what Kimmel’s suspension means for freedom of speech.

In solidarity, many have taken to social media to say that they have canceled their Disney+ and Hulu accounts, and several high-profile celebrities have spoken up in Kimmel’s defense — including Stephen Colbert, whose own show was axed earlier this year, and former president Barack Obama.

And on Thursday night, Kimmel’s fellow late-night host Jimmy Fallon addressed the controversy on The Tonight Show, where he also poked fun at growing political censorship across America.

“Well, guys, the big story is that Jimmy Kimmel was suspended by ABC after pressure from the FCC, leaving everyone thinking: ‘WTF?’” Fallon began before joking: “This morning, I woke up to 100 text messages from my dad saying: ‘I'm sorry they canceled your show…’ And I go: 'That’s not me… That’s Jimmy Kimmel!'”
“To be honest with you all, I don’t know what’s going on, and no one does,” Fallon went on. “But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he’s a decent, funny, and loving guy, and I hope he comes back.”

“A lot of people are worried that we won’t keep saying what we want to say, or that we'll be censored,” the host continued. “But I’m gonna cover the president’s recent trip to the UK just like I normally would.”

Fallon then went into a bit where a loud booming voice spoke over him every time he seemingly said something negative about President Donald Trump.

“Well, guys, President Trump just wrapped up his three-day trip to the UK, and he looked incredibly handsome,” he began, with the interruption sparking applause from the live studio audience. “As always, his tie was exactly the right length, and his face looked like a color that exists in nature, and his hair looked better than Conrad’s from The Summer I Turned Pretty.”

FYI, the italics mark what the voiceover "corrected" in Fallon's speech.
Fallon then referenced how UK protestors projected photos of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle during his visit, saying: “During the trip, protesters managed to project images onto the sides of Windsor Castle of Trump standing next to his good friend Jeff Goldblum, even though his administration still insists that he's not in the Goldblum files, which we all know is absolutely bulltrue.”

“Anyway, to sum it up, President Trump is making America great again by restoring our national reputation, reinvigorating our economy, and rebuilding our military. I hereby nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize,” Fallon went on before concluding: “And you can quote me on that!”
