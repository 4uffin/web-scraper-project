A while back, we shared some of the embarrassing questions men were afraid to ask women. But then a bunch of women ended up providing smart, well-thought-out answers to those questions. Here's what they said:
1.
Q: "I always assumed periods were a constant stream of blood (like a cut, as another redditor put it). Apparently, this is wrong, so how does it work? Small gushes?"
—[deleted]
A: "Think if it like when you have a runny nose. You likely don't have a constant stream out your nose, but at times it trickles out or gushes (especially when you sneeze or cough)."
—sondheimgeek
2.
Q: "What's the most neutral and comfortable way to start a conversation (maybe at a bar), without being too shy or too aggressive/rude?"
—[deleted]
A: "This is likely going to vary from woman to woman, but I'd say don't try to be smarmy or smooth, just be yourself and say hi. More importantly, though, look for cues from her. If she says hi and then goes back to reading her book/talking to her friends/looking at her phone she's not interested, so leave her be."

3.
Q: "Do you really like it when men roll up their sleeves?"
—Bigbird_Elephant
A: "Personally, no, I don’t care if you roll up your sleeves, I do find it attractive when a guy takes his shirt off from the back first. Like bunches it up and pulls from the back, but all different."

4.
Q: Other than the obvious (lying, cheating, rude to you or your friends) what’s the quickest way for your S.O, or someone you’re interested in, to lose your respect?
—DanMittaul
A: "Men who put themselves down a lot, lack even a little ambition, or don't take care of themselves (basic hygiene and health) make me lose respect damned fast. You want me to take care of/have pride in myself; I expect the same from you."

5.
Q: "How do so many of you have such nice skin? I want to be silky smooth too."
—I_ate_your_skin
A: "Exfoliate and moisturize. I like soaps with a little exfoliating grit in them, but a lot of people prefer natural sponges, loofahs, or washcloths. Then follow up with some moisturizer. Doesn't have to be anything fancy, but pay special attention to your hands, elbows, knees, and feet, as those tend to be the areas of your body where the skin is the roughest."

Q: "What’s the deal with women going to pee together?"
—beetus_gerulaitis
A: "Women’s Bathroom culture (yes it has its own culture) is one of the greatest female experiences!! The bathroom is obviously a bathroom, but it’s also a salon, therapists office, photo booth, fashion show, etc. And women can enter the bathroom as strangers, but once inside they are BFFs!! You will cry, laugh, and be ready to fight a rando dude all because a literal stranger is crying in the bathroom! Those women are THE hype squad. If u feel a little self conscious, go to the bathroom because some girl is gonna tell you how gorgeous you are! Women’s bathrooms are just a magical place where anything can happen; men’s bathrooms are just a place where pee (and 💩) happens!"

Q: "What should I do to not make you feel threatened when I walk behind you at night? Cross the street?"
—kebabenthusiast03
A: "Keep a respectful distance. Make a call (even if it's a fake one) about random, harmless stuff. For example, to your mother. Speak about what you're doing there, where you're going. Maybe goof off a little on your (pretend call)."
—goldencactus894
8.
Q: "If bras give support, then why does it feel good when you take them off? Would it feel good to never wear a bra?"
—TinyThrowy
A: "It depends on the woman. I'm top heavy so going braless isn't an option for me, and I do like having the support. That said, it still feels good to get it off at the end of the day because it's got a lot of wires that can sometimes dig into me!"
—sondheimgeek"Not wearing a bra can cause back pain. Each breast weighs from 0.5 pounds and up. A bra is still a tight piece of fabric and sometimes wire you wear all day long that compress and lift breasts out of their 'natural' position. And, society gives women shit if they’re not wearing a bra/if there are visible nipples/etc."—suspiciouselephants

Q: "What do period pains feel like?"
—[deleted]
A: "It feels like a cheese grater shaving your insides out. THERE. I said it. Just go get us 🍫 and we’ll never speak of this again."

Q: "How do you all make those little towel hats when you get out of the shower?"
—mw407
A: How To Make A Towel Hat: 1. Hold the towel longways, so that the long edge faces the floor and the short edge faces the wall. 2. Bend and hang your head a little below your shoulders, so your hair falls downward in front of your legs/torso. 3. Place the towel over your head, with your head roughly in the middle of the towel’s length; the long edge of the towel should rest against the back of your head, right where your hairline meets your neck. Your head will be closer to one long edge than the other, and not in the true center of the whole towel."
"4. Take the two ends of the towel hanging on either side of your head, and pull them together so that they meet at the center of your forehead; then, twist the hanging ends around your hair. Don’t try to weave the two sides of the towel together like a RedVine. Just roll both sides together in one go, like you would to wring out a washcloth. 5. Now that the towel is twisted, straighten up from the previous bent-over position and flip the twisted ends backwards. You should now have the ends resting against the back of your head and your neck."—Anonymous

Q: "Do you agree that 'guys' and 'dudes' are gender neutral?"
—c0maTheWhale
A: "‘Guys,’ ‘dudes,’ ‘bitches,’ and ‘bros’ are all gender-neutral."
—Anonymous"It's sort of in a quasi state of both. They're definitely primarily male, but it's not weird to call a mixed group or a group of women 'guys' or 'dudes.' But if you say guy or dude, I assume the person you are talking about is male."—Moirawr

Q: "How do you not hurt yourself wiping with those long, pointy fake nails?"
—J3wb0y93
A: "I, personally, hate those long pointy nails but the women that I know that have them use the pads of their finger to touch things instead of the ends of their fingers. You have to adjust how you do everything when you have long pointed nails."

13.
Q: "How important is manscaping on a scale of 1-10?"
—[deleted]
A: "I'd say around 7, but I reckon it is very much a personal preference. I'd also say it depends on the hairiness of the individual. Taking care of yourself by staying clean, maybe groom a little, should get you very far."
—goldencactus894
14.
Q: "How much do appearances count compared to personality, when it comes to being asked out?"
—RazTheCrazed
A: "It starts with physical attraction but if you have a great personality you are a keeper!"
—Anonymous

15.
Q: "When you are really upset, how would you like your partner to respond or comfort you?"
—Think8437
A: "I like to be hugged and held. If you aren’t sure if that person wants you to hug them, the nicest thing a guy I barely knew ever did for me was he took my hand and laid it against his cheek and looked at me deep in my eyes and asked how he could help. I thought was wonderful and sincere. I fell for him immediately."
—Anonymous
16.
Q: "Why do you match on dating apps, then ghost after one message? I didn't even get the chance to blow it yet."
—Choiceofart
A: "WE either chicken out or get a reply from elsewhere that we want to look at as a possible good guy first. It’s nothing personal, just timing or we get nervous."
—Anonymous

17.
Q: "Does it appear weird that I have pads and stuff ready, even though I don't need any? My mother once said that it would be very nice when I have people over, and periods just happen. I agreed to that thought, so I have some in the bathroom."
—FanStrong3311
A: "You are AMAZING for this. If I went to your house and saw that you were fully stocked but are single, I would be immediately attracted to you."
—Anonymous
18.
Q: "What do girls do whilst sh*tting? If I go to take a dump without my phone, I feel like a neanderthal. Usually, I play a game of some sort and then read Reddit until my legs get tingly."
—progenitus666
A: "We do the same thing that guys do: play on our phones."
—Anonymous

19.
Q: "Do women play with their own breasts out it boredom? Like randomly squeeze them."
—Regera80
A: "Yep! Now and then when I'm alone, I squeeze and bounce them. Why? Because I can, and I love boobs! Especially my own 😅 they're like a pair of stress balls that i always have with me!"
—idachristinvoldbyt
20.
Q: "What is with the obsession with murder and true crime? The whole serial killer book/podcast industry seems largely female-oriented. Ironically, many females I know who love this stuff also hate fake violence in fictional movies."
—ngstr
A: "True crime gives a sense of control and safety. In a world where we have creepy men in our lives referring to us as females."

Q: "HOW DO YOU LIVE WITHOUT DEEP POCKETS IN YOUR PANTS??"
—[deleted]
A: "We either use bags/purses, alter the pockets to make them deeper, or (in my case) buy the majority of men's pants. The sizing's much easier to navigate and the fit is basically the same."
—Anonymous

And finally, Q: "How do you shampoo long hair? I've always had short hair, so lather and rinse is pretty easy, but with long hair, I feel like it would get complicated quickly."
—TheMathNut
A: "Shampooing long hair isn't all that difficult; you only really shampoo the scalp, not the ends. You CONDITION the ends, not the scalp, and that part can be a pain in the *ss."
—casachess"To shampoo long hair, what you want to do is wet your hair and then squirt an ungodly amount of shampoo onto your hand. Then, rub your hands together. This evenly distributes the cleanser. After this, rub most of one hand's worth of the cleanser on the top of the head to get all of the gunk on the scalp off. Then, use the rest on you hands to rub it on the section by the neck, the near ends, and the ends. Once you have done this, pick up all of you hair and rub it all together. This gets everything lathered. Then rinse. (Tip. Make sure you keep your hair out of the water while you apply the shampoo.) You should do this with conditioner too."—glitterycoyote372
