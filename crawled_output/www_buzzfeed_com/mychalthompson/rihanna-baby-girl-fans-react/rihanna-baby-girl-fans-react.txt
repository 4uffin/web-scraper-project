Who are we kidding? This is the best news ever! On Sept. 24, the "We Found Love" singer and "Praise the Lord" rapper, parents of sons RZA and Riot Rose, welcomed Rocki Irish Mayers on Sept. 13.

Rihanna cradled her newborn daughter, wrapped in a pink blanket, in a photo shared to her Instagram.

In a second photo that'll melt your heart because of the details, she shared a pair of pink boxing gloves with ribbons, seemingly a nod to A$AP and their daughter's namesake.

Rihanna fans know she's talked about being a mother to a baby girl for a hot minute. At the 2019 Diamond Ball, she called Black women "impeccable" and "special," telling Essence, "I'm a Black woman, I come from a Black woman, who came from a Black woman, who came from a Black woman, and I'm going to give birth to a Black woman.""I'm a black woman, I come from a black woman, who came from a black woman, who came from a black woman, and I'm gonna give birth to a black woman"- Rihanna pic.twitter.com/v8JiubYrp0‚Äî kidd (@kiddeyforyou) September 24, 2025

She's obviously stoked, and A$AP, who recently starred in Spike Lee's Highest 2 Lowest opposite Denzel Washington, is just as ecstatic for their newest family member. "MY LIL LADIES ‚ù§Ô∏è," he wrote in a comment on the IG announcement.

As for Rocki's big brothers, back in July, while promoting the Smurfs movie, Rihanna told Extra that her sons were "delighted" about a new sibling. And the best part of the news is they're far from being the only ones delighted.

The Navy, aka the Rihanna fandom, has always been 10 toes down for the Grammy-winning singer, and the reactions to the new baby are the proof in the pudding.
Celebrities from every corner of the industry have come out to show some love for little Rocki's epic debut. Of course, the fashion girlies are supporting Fenty's founder:

And since Rocki's mom and her stylish father are known for their fashion sense, people can't stop talking about how she "inherited the FLYEST closet a person could get from both parents."

And finally, it wouldn't be a Rihanna life update without everybody saying the same thing about getting new music.
It's been almost 10 years since her eighth studio album¬†Anti¬†was released.
