I know Theo Von as that reality TV star turned comedian from Season 9 of MTV's Road Rules, but to others, he might be considered a popular podcaster who helped amplify Trump during the 2024 presidential election.

If you remember, back in August 2024, Theo interviewed President Trump to discuss issues like healthcare, Trump's random friendship with UFC's Dana White, and controversial topics like homeland security.

The interview went mega viral and seemingly helped the president reach younger male voters. It currently sits at 17 million views on YouTube.
Well, Theo is back on the homeland security conversation, but not on his terms. On Sept. 23, the Department of Homeland Security shared a now-deleted 31-minute viral video that used a snippet from Theo saying, "Heard you got deported, dude. Bye."

The terrible advert, which shared troubling statistics about ICE deportations, was created in the style of popular meme videos that use overlayed text and the 2024 Flawed Mangoes song, "Dramamine."

People quickly suggested that Theo would have something to say about being used in the DHS video. "Oh man. Theo is going to have a heart attack after seeing this lmao. He just became the face of deportation," one person wrote.

Another person asked, "Do you approve of the usage of your content to promote mass deportations? @TheoVon."
X
They were right. Theo responded. "Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this," he replied in a Sept. 23 X post. "I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your 'banger' deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!"

There were people who were shocked that DHS posted the video. "Can't believe they used you for this without your permission. These videos are deranged," one person wrote.

But a lot of people were quick to call Theo out, since he did play a part in Trump's 2024 presidential campaign with his viral interview.

One person wrote, "But you did, in fact, say what's in that video. And you DID, in fact, endorse Trump basically. And you DID, in fact, attend his inauguration, even though his entire Campaign was 'deport everyone.' So, spare us."

"'Heard you got deported dude..bye' guy is suddenly a nuanced thinker on immigration policy whose content can't be used to get off a banger tweet lmao," another person said.

Someone else said, "Maybe shouldn't have had a fascist on before the election and give the impression you're in support of him. You're etched into the wrong side of history now, congrats."
@daviddoel / Via x.com
"This is what you endorsed Theo. You supported them when they said this is what they were going to do. You don't get to wash your hands of this now," someone else wrote.

Other people were even less forgiving, suggesting this is just the way of the internet culture.

And finally, this person said what I'm sure a lot of people are thinking, because "Whoever runs the DHS account is an edgelord who gets paid by taxpayers to shitpost."

What are your thoughts about the DHS video and Theo's unintentional involvement?
