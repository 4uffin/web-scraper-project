While I know her name is Princess Catherine of Wales, I can't help but mention "Kate Middleton" once because it's a lovely name that sounds like a tasteful clothing line of elegant fashion and high-end jewelry, and rightfully so.

On Sept. 17, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, wore a gold lace gown by Phillipa Lepley at the 2025 State Banquet at Windsor Castle, and the internet was obsessed.

The banquet was held for President Donald Trump and the first lady, Melania, where they were welcomed by King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

Her royal highness paired her golden ensemble with the Lover's Knot tiara, which she famously wore on several other notable occasions.

In July, the princess wore it during a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron and first lady Brigitte Macron.

The diamond and pearl tiara was one of the first worn by Catherine when she became the Princess of Wales. The tiara was originally designed for Queen Mary in 1913 and passed down to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II.

Queen Elizabeth passed the tiara down to Princess Diana shortly before her marriage to then-Prince Charles.

The tiara wasn't the only piece of historical significance that Princess Catherine wore during the 2025 State Banquet. Her earrings previously belonged to Queen Elizabeth II.

The diamond orbital pendant earrings were composed of diamond clusters with a central stone in the center, and are estimated to be worth £100,000 (about $135,000), according to experts from Steven Stone.
The princess's appearance has been a viral topic of conversation lately, and once again, the internet can't stop talking about this latest display of regalia.

Some people couldn't help but compare the Princess of Wales to the animated character from the 1997 film Anastasia.

And finally, people made jokes that the intricate design of the princess's gown looked oddly similar to something you'd see in Donald Trump's gaudy gold Oval Office.
