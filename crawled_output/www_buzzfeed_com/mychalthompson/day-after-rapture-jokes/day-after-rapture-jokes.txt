It's now Sept. 25, everybody's still here (for the most part), and #RaptureTok has some explaining to do.

When South African pastor Joshua Mhlakela claimed the Rapture was going to happen on Sept. 23 or 24, it went super viral. People reportedly quit their jobs, left survival guides for the "left behind," and even sold their cars.

Well, either everybody was ghosted by the heavens or the viral #RaptureTok got this one wrong. Except, perhaps a TikToker named Tilahun Desalegn, who claimed he received a direct message from God and apparently sold his car in preparation for the Rapture. He has yet to give up. He even posted a message on Sept. 25 saying there's still hope.

But, aside from folks like Tilahun, the rest of us (including folks plagued by our religious families' Rapture trauma) are still here on Earth, now with a hilarious selection of the best of post-"Rapture Day" jokes. Check 'em out:
