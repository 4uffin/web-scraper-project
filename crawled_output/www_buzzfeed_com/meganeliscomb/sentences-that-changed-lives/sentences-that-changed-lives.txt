Sometimes, it only takes a few words to make you see your life in a totally different way. Whether you're chatting with a friend, venting to a therapist, or making small talk with a stranger, you never know when someone else's point of view will open up your eyes. Recently, we asked members of the BuzzFeed Community to share the sentences that changed them forever, and their responses were all so real and relatable. Here's what they had to say:
1.
"Everyone you meet knows something that you don’t."

—Anonymous
2.
"A coworker once told me, 'Nobody on their deathbed says, 'I wish I had worked more.'''
—contagisblondnes
3.
“I don’t know what I would have done if I had lost you.” My now-husband said that to me in the middle of our third date at a baseball game. (We had been talking for a few months). I was on my way when I was in a massive car accident. I called him and told him I would be running a little late. He told me I could cancel if I wanted. There was no way I was doing that. I made it. He looked at me like no one had ever looked at me before when he said it."
"That day, we knew we would be married one day. It’s been 10 years since that day, and we've been married almost nine. Times aren’t always easy, and when they aren’t, this moment is all I have to remember."—pastelmatcha962
4.
"My parents used to ask me, 'Will this matter in ten years?' when I was upset. It was annoying at the time, but it always did put things into perspective and taught me to look forward instead of being stuck on present-day dramas."
NBC / Via youtube.com

5.
"Just because you spent years making the same mistake doesn't mean you have to keep making it."
—parryboucher
6.
"On a light note, I saw someone say on TikTok that when people drive like assholes, they tell themselves that maybe they just need to poop very badly. It's silly, but it helps me feel less scared and angry as a new driver."
—aliceinautieland
7.
"I was in a teacher professional development session, and someone said something like 'If one kid is failing, it might be the kid’s fault, but if everyone is failing, it’s definitely the teacher’s fault.' It made me stop and look closer at patterns and general trends instead of losing sleep over why little Johnny wouldn’t work up to his potential. I have an anxiety disorder, and I definitely took it as a sign that I was a failure if even one kid was struggling. It also helped me to catch the times when I wasn’t doing the best job at teaching."

"While it was said in that specific context, I feel like it applies to so many situations. If one person trips going up the stairs, it might be them; if everyone trips, there’s an issue with the stairs. You start catching those systemic issues when you are willing to look at the bigger picture."—francesjoys
8.
"As regards exercise: 'you can treat it as something you have to get through or you can treat it as an opportunity to do something hard.' It changed my attitude completely, and I now choose harder workouts and tell myself, you can love showing yourself how strong you can be."
—nyc4ever
9.
"In terms of relationships: 'Stop watering dead and fake plants.' I had a lot of one-sided relationships (friends and romantic) that felt like I was the only one putting in effort. I realized I was always the one reaching out and trying to keep the relationship going. I saw which people it was happening with and decided not to reach out until they contacted me. That was almost 20 years ago, and I still have not heard from most of them."
"Stop wasting your energy keeping relationships going when you are the only one putting forth that energy. Stop watering the dead or fake plants and use that energy on the healthy growing ones."—catsarebetterthanpeople21
10.
"I went through a horrible breakup during nursing school and wound up in an ER. The doc said to me, 'Just because you're not bleeding, doesn't mean something isn't wrong.' I will never forget this doc! Saved my life."

"'They shit like everybody else.' My mum has always been a confident saleswoman. Growing up, I lacked courage and confidence when dealing with others, and particularly in public speaking. When she said this, I got it. The whole 'imagine the audience naked' thing never made sense to me, but shitting, yes, for all scary meetings, talks, and whatever else. The simplest sentence has been a big help to my career, and I teach it now when training others on public speaking."

12.
"When I was a kid, I was terrified of everything. Once, my older cousin was in town, and we were sheltering in the basement during a tornado warning. I was losing my mind as usual, and, fed up with my drama, my cousin clapped her hands on my shoulders and yelled: 'CAN YOU DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?!' (Meaning preventing the tornado.) I sniffed miserably and mumbled, '....No?' She stuck her face in my face and screeched, 'THEN STOP @#$%ING WORRYING ABOUT IT!!!!'"
"Her delivery might have been a bit harsh, but it changed my entire life. I am no longer a worrier at all about anything beyond my control. I went from someone stealing from my present moment because of a theoretical future event, to someone who is the calmest one in the room amid chaos that's beyond my control."—oxfordcommasplz
13.
"Way back when I was bartending, struggling with my life in all aspects, a drunken regular at the bar sat down. As I started to get his order, he goes, 'You know what the best part about banging your head against a wall is? Stopping.' He walked out of the bar, and I never saw him again. And what he said has stuck with me ever since."

—Anonymous, 38 Hesperia, CA
14.
"My best boss said, 'I don’t care what you screw up; learn from it and don’t do it again.'"
—Anonymous, 67 from Roswell, GA
15.
"'But you’re still going to be 50 anyway,' from a friend in response to my hesitation about finishing an interrupted college degree, because by the time I graduated, I would be 50. I did it, and it began a second amazing chapter of my life!"
—Anonymous
16.

"Upon losing our daughter, a doctor said, 'All sun and no rain makes a desert.' I let myself feel the rain and pain and came to grow to appreciate the beauty in my life."
—Anonymous
19.
"I remember my dad saying, 'If you are going to give me roses, do it while I’m alive because I can’t smell them when I’m dead.' So much was said in that simple sentence. Don’t waste chances to show people you love them."
CBC / Via giphy.com
—Anonymous, 72. NY
20.
"During my divorce, I found myself offering to give up time with the kids, not wanting to 'take' items that were practically better for me to keep, etc. I didn’t want to be the mean ex-wife of legend that took the kids and all (even though his alcoholism was the reason for the divorce). My attorney said, 'You’re trying to make him be a good dad; he’s not.' Stopped me in my tracks and changed my whole outlook on life."
—Anonymous, 43 Tennessee
21.
"I was so upset with my best friend's insensitive comments and actions. My therapist's
reply was, 'Do you want to be somebody’s moral compass?' That has stuck with me."
—Anonymous, 62, Ft. Lauderdale Fl
22.
"As someone who is often guilty of catastrophising, one thing that helps if I'm worrying about something and thinking, 'What if it goes wrong?' is switching it instead to, 'What if it goes really well?'"

—joyfulelephant51

"'Don’t try to teach a pig to whistle; it wastes your time and annoys the pig.' Said to me by a therapist I was seeing about an unhealthy relationship I was trying to 'fix.'"
—Anonymous, 65, Arizona
25.
"I’d been in a confrontational relationship for years where every disagreement escalated into an argument or a fight. When I was dating my next husband, the very first time I put up my dukes and was ready to tangle, he just looked at me nicely and said, 'You might be right.' And that was the end of it. Once I started using that phrase, my life with him was forever placid."

"'When you are stubborn, you end up only hurting yourself.' This was wisely said to me by my mother 46 years ago when I shared that I was arguing with my husband. To this day, if we’re having a disagreement, this quote still pops up in my head. I’m reminded to work through these times rather than letting them fester. This advice has helped with having a strong, healthy, wonderful marriage. Celebrating 47 years this August."
—Anonymous, 72. Sag Harbor, NY

"The things that you’re not changing, you’re choosing."
—Anonymous, 21 North Carolina

"'These things are killing you,' said my boss as he grabbed my pack of Camels and threw them in the waste basket. I never retrieved them, and I never smoked again."

29.
"'You only need to miss a bullet by an inch.' In other words: even if you only barely avoided disaster, you still succeeded. A lot of things in life appear to be shades of grey or opposite sides of an ambiguous spectrum: good or bad, accomplished or unfulfilled, proficient or inept, etc. It makes it really tempting to chase perfection and get as far away from ‘bad’ as possible. Don’t get me wrong, there is definitely something to be said for giving your all and taking pride in what you do. At the end of the day, though, you only need to miss the bullet by an inch. No matter how close failure comes, a narrow escape is still an escape."
—Anonymous, 18, Texas
30.
"'It will be great or it will be over.' I heard this from a good friend, and I tell myself this every time I'm faced with doing something that scares me."
—Anonymous, 33, Colorado
31.
"Being distracted from sadness is not the same as happiness."

"'Clear is kind.' A coworker once told me this about giving feedback, and it really struck a chord with all types of communication."

And finally, "'Eat the good apples first.' When my grandpa was a boy, his family would buy bushels of apples to last the winter, and they would store them in the cellar. The children were told to look for the apples with bruises or spots, trim the bad parts off, and eat the remainder. By the time they had done this quite a few times, some of the 'good' apples would have started to spot. Thus, they never got to eat a complete, spotless apple. He figured out that this was wrong thinking. Life is short. Eat the good apples first! And this applies to so many other situations."
—Anonymous, 66, Missouri
