Just like romantic relationships, our friendships go through ups and downs. And sometimes, sadly, we might realize that it's time for a friendship to come to an end. Recently, people on Reddit shared the subtle red flags that made them realize a friendship was over, and it's so sadly relatable. Here's what they had to say:
1.
"It got to the point for me that when she texted me, I immediately felt sick to my stomach. I knew I had to say goodbye."

"If you leave every hangout feeling drained instead of happy, that’s your sign. Friends are supposed to add to your life, not make it feel like extra homework."
—MistyLilact"Being an introvert, I’ve had to learn who drains me and who just happens to be around me when my battery is depleted. I noticed that every time I would spend time with a certain person, I would leave exhausted and couldn't wait to be alone again. Other times, I may feel exhausted with someone who is not usually exhausting and take note of other factors that could be contributing to my exhaustion, such as diet, sleep, or work stress. To put it simply, try to be conscious of when you feel depleted and the experiences that led up to it, whether it’s a person or something else, you will likely eventually notice a trend or pattern over time."—AdLopsided8190

"When they stop having fun with you by laughing WITH you for each other's faults and quirks, and they start laughing AT you about the same things."
—SoccerLegs69
4.
"When disagreeing with you is their entire personality."

—deensuk"I had a friend like this. He always has to be right and speaks authoritatively on everything, even subjects he isn’t as versed in. And he’s an intelligent person in so many ways, so he could be a very interesting person to talk with.But I started getting annoyed when I noticed how intense his need to be right is. It often plays out in a devil's advocate way. Conversations would often turn into a grappling match instead of an exchange, even in the most pithy conversations.It was draining and very irritating."—thewickedmitchisdead
5.
"If you catch some lying to your face on multiple occasions over things that don’t need to be lied about. If you can’t just be honest with me, then what’s the point?"
—CraftyStretch7034
6.
"When they only ever contact you when they need something. They have plenty of time for other friends but never any for you."
—fairytalefawnn"I used to work with this girl for two years. We were friendly and chatted often (never hung out, but she added me on Instagram). I got a new job, so we lost touch. Then, three years later, out of the blue, she asks me how I’m doing.I tell her about what I’ve been up to, and of course, immediately she’s like, 'Hey, do you have $3k to lend me? I don’t have money to make rent, and I’ve been swamped with medical bills, yada yada,' and I immediately got a bad vibe. I simply told her sorry that she’s going through it all, but I’m broke as hell, too. She left me on read, then a week later, she posts pictures on Instagram of her partying her ass off in Las Vegas with her boyfriend, table service and all. I blocked her dumb ass."—Icy-Move-3742

"If the friendship is based around substances, alcohol, and weed, for example, that’s not a friendship. Take away the substance and watch how the definition of friendship completely changes the social dynamic."

"When you realize you are always defending them. Maybe they aren't worth defending. 'They had a rough life.' 'They didn't mean any harm.' Maybe the benefit of doubt is more habit than deserved."

9.
"If they don’t respond to messages or return calls. If someone doesn’t want to hang out with me, I move on."
—gingerjuice"I've had to learn this. I've distanced myself from a few people I'd thought I was pretty close with. I'd text them just to ask about their day and how things were going with them. Sometimes they'd respond, and we'd text a bit before they stopped responding, or they just wouldn't respond at all. I was also the only one reaching out. It wasn't like I was reaching out all the time either. I just got sick of always being the one to initiate any communication. I wouldn't even get a 'sorry, I'm going through some shit right now' type of response."—SolaScientia

"When they see no problem with mutual friends (or other people in general) treating you poorly. If they don't have your back, they are not friends."

"When you're going through a really rough part of your life, and they don't reach out and check in on you. I haven't spoken to most of my high school or college friends since August 2023. They're just gone from my life now."
—TheJewBakka"When my 12-year-old daughter was diagnosed with cancer, my 'best friend' reached out with a text saying she was praying for us. I never heard from her again. Up until this point, we spoke on the phone daily!"—FoxRevolutionary2632
12.
"If you hear them talking badly about someone they are friendly to in person, run. You know they are talking behind your back, too."
—Smart_Elderberry9695
13.
"When they stop reaching out after getting a partner. One of my best friends was dating a guy on and off for the past year or so. I saw her about two or three times a month or so, all great fun. The moment they made their relationship official, she hardly texted me anymore. When I asked her a few times to hang out, I got met with, 'I'm busy with school, and I'm at x every weekend,' so after a few weeks, I told her that I missed her, and she said, 'Well, I already told you, I don't have time.'"

"When they can’t celebrate your wins. Your milestones or achievements are met with 'what if it goes wrong?' rather than a smile. Almost as if a soft competition has taken over the overall feeling of the friendship. Crabs in a bucket mindset. It destroys the core of a friendship."
—bassoonbetch"I had two 'what if it goes wrong' people in my life at the same time once. My self-esteem was in shambles. It’s all a game, and they lost."—MonarchsCurveball
15.
"When you have to change your language around them to a degree because you know they are just going to be upset if you say the wrong thing."
—the6sic6"This is one of the things I’m pondering right now personally. I do have to be a different person in front of a friend because they are way too easily upset by accidentally saying the wrong thing. They are a good person, but they have some work to do. I love them and I would like for them to do that work and for me to be there at the end of it, but at the same time, my peace is becoming more and more disrupted."—J-Fearless
16.
"When you stop empathizing with them. They have a shitty day, and instead of supporting them, you're glad about it. It's a shitty feeling, but it's a sign to remove yourself from that relationship."

"When they cannot show vulnerability or apologize for their mistakes. I just had a friendship end where I apologized for my role in a conflict between us and received a shallow, hollow not-apology. Not worth investing my time."
—Notori0usRBG
18.
"When the person is always one-upping you. I had a friend like this, and when we both became successful in our careers, I realized she was always comparing our possessions. I’d tell her about my new house, and she’d say something negative instead of being happy. It’s never a compliment. You just got a new car? Oh, mine is better, blah, blah. Sure enough, I recently dropped her like a hat."

19.
"When they never ask about anything in your life and only talk about themselves."

—Calfro93"I'm going through this exact scenario with a longtime friend, and when I tried to gently talk to her about how she was treating me, her actual words were that she didn't understand why she should be 'expected to jump through hoops' to ask questions about me. She suggested I offer more topics openly (which is a seriously awkward way for me to feel like talking; I don't like to narrate to people unless asked about something). Also, in the past, when I've proactively brought up bits and pieces about my life, her responses have always shifted the flow of the conversation back to herself."—charshie

"When you find yourself always wanting to cancel or have to 'mentally prepare' to see them."
—temp-things
21.
"When they don’t let you finish your sentences. They don’t respect you enough to let you talk."
—Less-Ad5674"This hurts as someone who finds it difficult to articulate my thoughts into words. Before I can say anything, I'm getting bombarded with constant pressure, and all of a sudden I've lost everything I wanted to say, and I look like I'm wrong."—mtamez1221"Oof. I had someone not only interrupt me, but speak full sentences over me. I felt so disrespected. I never had someone do that to me prior to this person."—whitetanksss
22.
"When they push your boundaries and don’t respect your no. If they do it once, they are gonna repeat it."

23.
"When it stops being a friendship and turns into you being a caretaker. When you start seriously going out of your way for this person. When you stop for a moment and ask yourself, 'Would this person do this for me?' and the answer is an obvious no."
—PropaneInMuhUrethra
24.
And finally, "If you feel like it's over. If you've got to the point where you are considering dropping someone you think of as a friend, then there's something going on that means you should probably do it."
