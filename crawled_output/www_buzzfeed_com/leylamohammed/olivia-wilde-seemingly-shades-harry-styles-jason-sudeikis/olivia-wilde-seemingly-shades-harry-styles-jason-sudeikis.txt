Olivia Wilde is going super viral after seemingly throwing a little shade at her exes. Yes, plural!

In case you need a quick refresher, Olivia famously dated Jason Sudeikis for almost a decade, spending seven of those years engaged.

The pair, who welcomed two children while they were together, parted ways in November 2020, and as I’m sure you’ll recall, the split was pretty messy. You can read more about that right here.
Months after Olivia and Jason split, she was romantically linked to Harry Styles, whom she dated for almost two years.

Now, several internet users are convinced that Olivia made a hilarious jab at either Jason or Harry — or both — on Instagram.

This week, Olivia reshared a post from the meme page @peachyyaquarius that read, “I know some of you would fold over a mf like this,” next to a mini figurine of a man with long-ish hair concealed by a cap, and an eye-catching mustache. Olivia simply added a telling skull emoji under the post.

Tons of internet users immediately compared the figurine to Harry, with some even speculating that Olivia sharing the meme meant she was “not over” their split.

“that's Harry Styles??” one Instagram comment read, while another agreed, “Harry Styles is that u.”“someone's not over her breakup with a very attractive british man with a beautiful moustache,” one more person guessed.
Meanwhile, others felt it was a spitting image of Jason.

“I mean the resemblance is uncanny,” someone wrote alongside a picture of Harry, while someone else said, “Is this supposed to be about H or Jason? Either way, I kinda see where she’s coming from this time.”
LOL. Do you see the resemblance? Let us know down below.
