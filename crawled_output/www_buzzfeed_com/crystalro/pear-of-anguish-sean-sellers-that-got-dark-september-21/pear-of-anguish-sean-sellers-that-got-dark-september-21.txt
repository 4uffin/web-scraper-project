Hi, friends! I'm Crystal, and I write the That Got Dark newsletter, BuzzFeed's weekly roundup of all things creepy, macabre, and horrible AF. And if you looooove this kind of content, you should subscribe to get your weekly dopamine fix of the macabre delivered RIGHT to your inbox!

Here's what the newsletter is covering this week:
1.
The (supposed) existence of a flesh-ripping torture device called the “pear of anguish.” Apparently, it was a metal object shaped like a pear (hence the name), with segments that would be forced open by turning a key or screw, making it expand once placed inside someone’s mouth, throat, or, uh, other orifices, causing unbearable pain or injury as it widened.

If it’s any consolation, though, historians have found no evidence that it was actually used for torture in the Middle Ages. The first mention of such a device appears in the 1600s, and experts now think the surviving examples were probably misidentified or crafted later as curiosities. But we’ll never REALLY know…
2.
The creepy existence of Interlachen, Florida, which is basically a huge area of endless dirt roads that lead to nothing, and where nobody lives.

“Years ago, I was driving in north-central Florida along Route 20 near Interlachen, taking my daughter to Girl Scout camp. Way outside of town, where there is absolutely nothing, I saw on Google Maps that there are streets laid out like a city of 100,000 people, but there are just trees as far as I can see. So I slowed down to see if any of these streets existed, and they did — but they were dirt roads. I spent an hour just driving around on all these dirt roads, and there is at most one house or trailer per block, and everything else is just empty dirt roads. To this day, I have no idea why all those dirt roads are there and why Google knows about them. Maybe a real estate developer went out of business during a big project? This was a few years after the 2008 real estate crisis, so maybe the market just disappeared. Whatever the reason, driving around a whole town with basically nobody living there was creepy."

The unsettling Max Headroom signal hijacking that remains unsolved to this day.

On Nov. 22, 1987, two Chicago TV stations had their broadcast signals hijacked by an unknown person wearing a Max Headroom mask*. In the videos, the person made references to things like the "real" Max Headroom, various shows and people, and then ended with having their naked butt spanked by a woman with a flyswatter. To this day, no one knows who was behind the bizarre and unsettling prank.
*Max Headroom, for those who don't know, was a character created in the '80s for Channel 4 in the UK that was meant to look like a computer-generated AI being. He was actually played by an actor, Matt Frewer.

This spooky story about the Black Cross in Butler County, Pennsylvania:

“The Black Cross/Wooden Cross Cemetery in Butler County, Pennsylvania, is a mass grave of victims from the 1918 influenza pandemic that's notoriously haunted. Ironically, a while back, there was a show on Netflix about the next big pandemic and how it was coming (foreshadowing 2020), and the opening scene of the show was them going to the Black Cross to look at the grave site. A lot of people hear voices, and there's just a general heaviness to the spot."

Finally, the story of teenage serial killer Sean Sellers.

Sellers was just 16 years old when he shot and killed a convenience store clerk during a robbery in 1985. Less than a year later, he murdered his mother, Vonda, and stepfather, Lee Bellofatto, while they slept. Sellers later claimed his actions were influenced by his obsession with Satanism and even said he was under demonic possession at the time of the murders. He was executed by lethal injection in 1999, making him the only person in the US executed for crimes committed under 17 since the death penalty’s reinstatement in 1976.
His last meal: Egg rolls, wontons, sweet and sour chicken, fried shrimp, chow mein noodles, stir-fried vegetables, three cans of V8 juice, and a Squirt soda.
