While monogamy is considered the traditional approach to relationships, not every couple chooses what's conventional. According to Queering Psychology, "A polyamorous person is someone who can date, commit to, and/or love more than one person... Polyamory involves being in multiple relationships with multiple people. Building connections, feelings, and commitments with more than one person. Each relationship looks different depending on the situation and on the needs of the people in each relationship. In [polyamory], none of the relationships are secret. Every relationship has its boundaries and commitments depending on what the people in the relationship(s) want."
Likewise, polyamory is not the same thing as having an open relationship or swinging because "it does not focus only on sex and/or dating."
Here are 19 celebs who've opened up about their polyamorous relationships:

In early 2025, Ne-Yo confirmed he's in a relationship with four women, telling the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, "It ain't about juggling. The key ingredient to making it work is honesty. Everybody gotta be telling the truth, you know what I mean? ...It works. Everybody's honest. Everybody's telling the truth. Everybody is consenting. I feel like I wasted a lot of time just being dishonest about things to the point where, had I taken this approach initially, probably could've saved myself a lot of headache and hearteache."

On Instagram, he introduced his "pyramid": Cristina, Arielle, Moneii, and Bri. He also said that, in their relationship, the women aren't allowed to date other people. He told The Angie Martinez Show, "When I got with these women, I did not ask for their exclusivity. I did not demand their exclusivity. They asked for it. They came to me and said, 'I want to be exclusive to you and just you.' I said, 'You understand that your exclusivity to me, does not mean my exclusivity to you? You understand this, yes? You're okay with it?' ...If for whatever reason you decide this isn't for you anymore, the door is never locked. You have permission to go on about your business. I don't want anybody to think that I'm manipulating these women into doing something they don't want to do."

Additionally, in a livestream with Kai Cenant, Ne-Yo said, "I was married before this, to one woman. Things didn't go well…and I made my mistakes. We got divorced, and a lot of people got hurt in the process. And I told myself in that moment, 'I ain't lying to nobody about nothing ever again.'" He also explained that he has an Alaskan king bed for the five of them.

Bella Thorne was in a polyamorous relationship with Tana Mongeau and Mod Sun from around late 2017 to early 2019. Bella and Tana's breakup had a messy aftermath involving public Twitter spats and both women releasing diss tracks about each other. Likewise, Bella and Mod had a public post-breakup argument on Twitter.

In 2019, Bella told Cosmopolitan, "Obviously, dating two people at once is a little difficult. I'm just with Ben [Mascolo, her then-partner] now, so I'm not seeing any girl currently. If you're gonna date a guy and a girl at the same time, those people have to really fuck with each other. Or literally fuck with each other. You know what I'm saying? It's like, it really depends on finding the right mesh of two people. If it works, you can spend a weekend with two people and you're all hanging out and having fun and smoking, and like, sharing stories up late at night. Kind of having fun acting like children in that way."

She continued, "It's a really fun experience, and I have been able to capture that a couple times, and I just love that idea. I love loving two people at once. I love sharing stories with three people in one room. So, I'm always trying to find ways to make it work because I think it really would make me happy... A lot of my partners start out like, 'What?' and I'm like, 'Bro, this is who I am.' So, you're either down or you're not down, and I totally understand if you're not down. At this point in my life, I want to find what makes me the happiest, and that is the mission I am on. If you don't want to be on that mission with me, then okay, I totally understand. If it will hurt you too much, then we're not right for each other at this moment in my life, because this is what I'm looking for."

"A lot of people are actually down, and it totally changes their mind. At first, they're like, gasp, 'How do you even do that?' And then we talk it through, and they're like, 'Wow, that actually sounds kind of beautiful,'" she said.

Tana Mongeau's relationship with Bella Thorne had a profound effect on her personal understanding of her own sexuality. In a 2019 YouTube video, she shared, "It's funny, because meeting Bella and going into it in the beginning, I felt like there was this, like, tension between Mod and I, I guess you would say, in the sense of, like, obviously, Bella's his girlfriend. Here I am, just coming in, and Bella wants me here, but she has a whole ass boyfriend. And he wasn't my boyfriend, and I didn't want him to be. And he didn't want me to be his girlfriend. It was this weird thing of him and I, like, sharing her."

She continued, "But at the same time, after a time, it became so harmonious and absolutely normal to us. After the initial part of that being weird or different, Mod and I ended up just spending so much time together. It wasn't until we got into the studio and started making music and spending hours and hours talking that I was like, 'Damn, this is one of the most incredible people I've met' as well. But he still was just my friend... No one could understand the fact that everything was just open, that even though I loved Bella, I still wanted to do my thing and date and see other people, and so did she. Obviosly, she had a whole ass boyfriend!"

"Being in that relationship taught me so much about myself and polyamory and openness and how close-minded the world can be and how open-minded the world can be, but I think that both Bella and I were under the same premise of, 'We are 20 years old...what is the point of tying ourselves down, especially in this world of fame and celebrities and people constantly testing the waters of your relationships and trying to intervene and interfere?' And both of us being people that constantly want what we can't have or wanna have fun or wanna explore things," she said.

Tana also said that, the year prior, she'd been in a "toxic ass, fucked-up" monogamous relationship. She said, "[It] really made my ideals of monogamy very different, and it made me realize that, at this point of life where I'm constantly traveling everywhere and meeting new people, I'm in no position to be tied down. It absolutely, at that time, was a recipe for disaster, and Bella and I are very much the type of people that we could go do our thing for an entire week. She could go be with Mod or someone else or whatever it may be, and I could be alone or with someone else or doing whatever I want, but when we come back together, we pick up exactly where we left off, and there's no jealousy, and there's no tension, and there's nothing weird about it at all."

Frankie Grande was in a "throuple" with married couple Daniel Sinasohn and Mike Pophis from late 2018 to early 2019. After breaking up with them, he told Us Weekly, "I'm super grateful for my last relationship. I grew so much in it, and at the same time, it wasn't working out anymore. I'm super glad that we decided to end things amicably. And that we can all remain friends … that's the important thing."

In 2022, he told Tamron Hall, "I've always been the person that says yes to whatever comes into my life, and I've never been afraid to take risks or…do something unconventional. That's kind of always been my brand. So when this relationship presented itself to me, I was like, 'You know what, why not? Let's just try it. Let's go in.' And you know, it did not work... I remember, I was talking to Madonna, of all people…talking to the queen, I told her about the throuple, and she literally said, 'Well, that's not going to end well.'"

In 2025, Frankie told the Zach Sang Show, "When you get sober, you're supposed to be out of a relationship for one year... So, one year and one day literally after my sobriety, I'm on Fire Island, single, ready to mingle... So, I fucking meet this married couple, and we have our one-night stand, so I thought, that ended up being four months. Then they were like, 'Come into our life. Be our live-in boyfriend and be with us all the time.' What happened, because they were a doctor and a lawyer, they literally had zero time for me, and it just became like I was the 'sidechick,' which wasn't great for me... It wasn't an equilateral triangle... and it just crumbled. But, man, it did exactly what I needed for myself, which was to prove to me and to the world that sober Frankie was not boring."

He also told Tamron Hall that the experience taught him that he "wanted a monogamous relationship." He's now married to Hale Leon.

In 2023, Janelle Monáe told British Vogue that they'd been in previous polyamorous relationships. They said, "I never was the girlfriend that would be jealous. Looking back, I'm like – clearly!"

She continued, "Nothing about me speaks to binary. I don't think I had the words to express it before… I listened to my spirit, and my spirit was screaming, 'You are a free-ass mothafucka! The more I am free in my thinking and living outside of the binary, I'm on a constant discovery of who I can be. I can hold space for a lot of different things at the same time. I just felt like I wanted to free up my mind."

In 2023, rapper and singer Jidenna told The Daily Cannon that he was "deep in love" and "years in love," and he confirmed he was polyamorous. He said that, after getting his "first big check," he bought a house in Atlanta and moved "everybody from New York down there." He continued, "In that time period, I then had two girlfriends. I moved to another house — two girlfriends in the same house, both aware it was an openly polyamorous relationship. I had the same logic [as Nick Cannon]. 'I'm creating this institution.' In fact, I was using the Nigerian — I was like, 'I'm a chief, this my village.' 'Cause my grandfather was polygamist. I have a long line of polygyamy in my family..."

He said, "So, I'm living that life, and I thought that just because I provided — I was rarely ever home. So, I'm thinking, 'What do you want? I'm working hard for you.' That is not a contract that, one, they really signed up for. Two, I don't think that it's enough. That's not what nourishes a relationship, like me just providing things. That was number one. Number two, the thing that I learned was, I cannot ask of them to do something that I'm not doing in practice. That's number two. So, if I'm over here, 'cause I had women outside of that relationship... Number three, and this is the biggest thing, my concept of what a 'king' was was off. We conflate 'king' with 'dictator' or 'tyrant,' but there were differnt types of kings in history..."

"What that meant for me is, I had to be okay with the women that I was seeing, having them see other people, be interested in other people. And eventually, I did that, and it was difficult. I had to, first of all, had to take the pain and jealousy and rage that came in me when I'm knowing they on a date," he said. He also explained to Nick Cannon that his partners dating other people wasn't "infiltration," and he met the other men later in the relationship.

In 2018, Kehlani addressed speculation about their sexuality, tweeting that they were a "lil poly pansexual." Several years later, they came out as a lesbian.

In 2021, Margaret Cho told Today, "I don't have that kind of relationship where I can't see other people, but you slow down. I just want things to be simpler. So yeah, I love polyamory, but it's just so much talking and a lot of work. I can't do it. I always end at one even though in my mind, I am poly, but I'm too, too, too busy."

On a 2021 episode of Red Table Talk, Willow Smith said, "With polyamory, I feel like the main foundation is the freedom to be able to create a relationship style that works for you and not just step into monogamy because that's what everyone around you says is the right thing to do. So I was like, how can I structure the way that I approach relationships with that in mind? Practicing monogamy has to be a choice that you make, just like practicing polyamory. It can't be because I'm told I'm supposed to do it this way. That, my dear, is deeply antiquated and no longer works."

In 2020, YUNGBLUD told Attitude, "I probably would say now, I am polyamorous. Before I didn't fucking know what I was. I was meeting people and learning… by meeting them and talking about sexuality and gender, I [was] going, 'Oh my fucking God, maybe I'm this, if I'm going to be fucking close to anything on the spectrum."

In the same interview, he also said he was pansexual, adding, "You've got to lose yourself in a load of people to figure who you are sexually… fuck me, bruv, two years [ago], I fucking hated olives, now I love olives!"

In 2016, actor Nico Tortorella told Cosmopolitan, "[Being in a polyamorous relationship is] part of who I am. I'm open to all types of relationships. I don't think I've found the right fit, quite yet, but I'm down to keep exploring. Relationships and people are my hobby of sorts. I love exchanging energy with people and getting to know people, and falling in and out of love. It's, like, my favorite thing to do in the whole world."

Bethany C. Meyers had been in a long-term poly relationship with Nico Tortorella for more than ten years before they got married in 2018, and they're still together and share two children. In 2017, Bethan told the Advocate, "I think we're raised with this idea that you're supposed to go and find 'the one,' especially women. You're looking for your Prince Charming. You need to be proposed to. There's this one person you're searching to find, so the idea of finding a stability partner, and having other things on top of that, feels too messy. Then the dating apps make sense because now it's easier to find 'the one.' You can swipe back and forth. You can do a preliminary screening. It's [like] a business tool."

Bethany also said that they identify as gay and that Nico was the only man they were interested in being in a relationship with. They said, "So many people have this idea that if you can love this, you cannot love this. And I don't understand, because I do. I can have feelings for two people. There are different kinds of feelings; they fulfill different needs. I don't find it very realistic to think that I'm going to get everything I need out of Nico."

Comedian DeRay Davis "can't remember ever being single," and he'd had two girlfriends since he was around 12 or 13. In 2019, he told the podcast Why Won't You Date Me? with Nicole Byer, "I think it's more of an organic thing, like, I explain to a woman that I'm seeing that she's not the only person I'm seeing. If she doesn't wanna be part of whatever's going on, I can understand that. Most times, they're like, 'Hell no,' but the most successful relationships, women have started out saying, 'Bullshit. What are you talking about? What do I look like? How do I explain to my mom? What the fuck are you talking about?'"

He continued, "And I'll say something like, 'Gimme a second, meet this person. Tell me how you feel about that person, first of all, because putting the title of 'girlfriend/boyfriend' came from society. I never say, 'You gonna be my girlfriend'... It's like, we're all dating."

In 2016, DeRay and his partners at the time, Coco Crawford and Caro Peguero, appeared on Living with Funny. He told the Chicago Tribune, "We're able to show that it's not exactly what people think. It ain't no huge sex party going on. It's a real, mature relationship... It's not Six Flags Great America at home … but it is a fun ride to see this situation."

In 2020, actor Baron Vaughn told the podcast Sex Out Loud, "I consider myself a non-monogamous person, a polyamorous person. I am in a monogamous marriage. Now, even though I consider myself a polyamorous person, I am now at the conclusion that I don't actually know what the hell that means for me, right? It's a word I've been saying for a really long time, and feelings, if you will, instincts, things that I always were drawn to since I was a teenager, and nobody around me was always about this stuff. So, it's not like I heard about polyamory and started being like, 'That's what I am!' I was 14 having ideas about relationships and not understanding this dynamic of possession and possessiveness and jealousy. At 14, I never understood, and I always felt like jealousy was such a toxic, evil emotion..."

In his 2020 YouTube video "My Two Boyfriends," Bob the Drag Queen introduced his two partners at the time, Jacob Ritts and Ezra Michel. Bob explained, "We're not a throuple. A lot of people think, like, Derrick Barry, they're in a relationship where all three of them are, like, together. But [Jacob and Ezra] are not boyfriends."

She continued, "Jacob and I met...around Christmastime 2017. And I was doing a show at the San Francisco Symphony, and then we met on Grindr... I ended up moving to San Francisco later to do a play. I lived there for six months. Jacob and I were basically living together... Then I moved back six to eight months later, and then maybe six to eight months later, [Jacob] moved to New York City. And then I met Ezra on the second most popular gay dating app, Instagram, and I slid into the DMs... From there, we basically started dating after that... Jacob was my first boyfriend ever. I don't have any exes. My first two boyfriends are sitting right here. Honestly, we're figuring things out as we go along as well."
Bob the Drag Queen / Via youtube.com
Explaining how he made sure he was giving each partner enough time and attention, Bob said, "I actually did struggle with this for a while, with the feeling that I was neglecting, but I just quite flat out asked, 'Do you feel like you're getting enough time and being treated fairly?' I just asked it straight out of my mouth, and that feels like, for me, that's been the best thing."

Appearing on Boyfriend Material with Harry Jowsey in 2025, she said, "I have a partner in LA and a partner in Georgia. They know each other. They're not, like, super close or anything. They do like each other, and my partners also have partners, too, which is great for me because I'm a really independent person, and I actually don't like the idea of being someone's everything. I actually kind of get exhausted at the idea of being around someone all the time, so having your partner have a partner is really a gift. I have two partners, and they are called paramours. They are each other's paramours, and I would be the hinge because they are both hinged to me. Now, I am paramours with someone else, and then this [shared] partner is the hinge. They're each a hinge as well."

In 2016, RuPaul's Drag Race alum Derrick Barry — who's in a relationship with artist Nick San Pedro and drag performer/fellow Drag Race alum Nebraska Thunderfuck — told the Advocate, "There are a lot of personalities at all times, and that is not always easy. Now, with Nebraska, there are five of us — two girls and three boys — a lot of closet space and a lot of personality... Our dynamic is important for me because for, over four years, it has been just the three of us. A big misconception, especially in the gay community, is that it's like a revolving door, and it isn't like that. I hope people can see that it's possible to be in love with two people and be in a committed three-way relationship."

In 2017, Nebraska Thunderfuck told Hey Qween, "A benefit to this type of relationship is that you don't get bored. Derrick offers me something that Nick doesn't, and Nick offers me something that Derrick doesn't... I was gone for a month [with the military], and I found myself thinking about them the entire time, and so I knew there was something there. When I got back, we were dating for about a month when I realized that I needed to make things serious."

And finally, Nick San Pedro told Hey Qween, "At first, I was like 'Oh God, what is my Cuban, Catholic family going to think? I don't know if I can handle this.' It took a few years of adjustment for the family, but now most of the family embraces us with open arms."
