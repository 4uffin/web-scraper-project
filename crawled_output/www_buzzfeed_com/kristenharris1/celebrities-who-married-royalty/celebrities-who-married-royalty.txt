Plenty of kids dream of becoming celebrities or royalty one day — some actually grow up to be both! However, not every royal relationship ends in happily ever after.

Here are 17 celebs who married into royalty:
1.
In 2012, Jessica Chastain met Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, an Italian count, in Paris on the same day she was nominated for her first Academy Award.

The Italian monarchy was abolished in 1946, but they were permitted to keep their titles.
Five years later, they got married at Villa Tiepolo Passi, his family's historic home. However, his title didn't have a big impact on their relationship. She told People, "It's really prevalent in the media, but it's not something like we sit around and talk about his title." They have two children, Giuletta and Augustus.

In 2003, Olivia Wilde and Tao Ruspoli, an Italian prince, eloped on the school bus he lived in at the time.

She told Women's Health, "My dad did have a minor heart attack, and it was hard to imagine settling down at the time. But there was this wave of romantic excitement and an overwhelming sense that we were supposed to be family. We were very open to the idea that if it didn't work, we would let it go its course. No pressure... Everyone expects him to pick me up in a limo or a yacht. Then Tao rolls up in this old Thunderbird, wearing flip-flops, his hair all crazy. People are like, 'He's a prince?'"

In 2011, they divorced. A source told Us Weekly that the couple split for "typical Hollywood reasons," citing Olivia's burgeoning career. Another source said she was young when they got married, and the couple had grown in different directions.

Jamie Lee Curtis literally picked her husband out of a magazine — Christopher Guest, aka 5th Baron Haden-Guest. She told Oprah.com, "One spring afternoon in 1984, I was sitting in my living room with my friend Debra Hill, the producer and co-writer of Halloween. I was 25 years old and feeling cautiously optimistic about life, having just broken off a relationship and purchased a beautiful apartment in Los Angeles. I felt I'd really voted for myself — chosen to take financial and personal risks to become fully independent. Debra and I were flipping through a Rolling Stone magazine when I turned to a photograph of three men. I looked at the man on the right, wearing a plaid shirt and a waggish smirk. I'd never seen him before, but I pointed at him. 'I'm going to marry that man,' I said to my friend."

"'That's Chris Guest,' said Debra. 'He's in a very funny new movie called This is Spinal Tap. I know his agent.' The next day, I called the agent, gave him my number, and told him to have Chris call me if he was interested. I waited. Chris never called," she said. So, she went on to date someone else, but she knew it wasn't meant to be. When they broke up, she dropped her ex off at the airport and then headed to dinner with her friends. At the restaurant, she saw Chris in person for the first time. He waved to her, but they didn't speak.

Jamie continued, "The next day, on June 28, the phone rang. On July 2, Chris and I had our first date at Chianti Ristorante on Melrose. And by August 8, when he left to tape a year of Saturday Night Live in New York City, we'd fallen in love." They got married that December. The couple has two daughters, Annie and Ruby.

Jamie doesn't use the title Lady Haden-Guest. In 2016, she told Architectural Digest, "It has nothing to do with me."

French Montana and Dubai princess Sheikha Mahra — who famously divorced her ex-husband in an Instagram post accusing him of cheating — were first romantically linked in October 2024 after she shared pictures from her time showing the rapper around her city. The couple made their public debut during Paris Fashion Week the following year.

Her ex-husband, Sheikh Mana Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid bin Mana Al Maktoum, has not publicly addressed her allegations that he cheated on her.
During Paris Fashion Week, French Montana made his runway debut at the 3.Paradis Ready to Wear Spring/Summer 2026 show. Not long after, he popped the question. They kept their engagement private for about two months before his reps confirmed it to TMZ in August 2025.

Private Practice and My So-Called Life actor A.J. Langer and Charles Courtenay, 19th Earl of Devon, met in Las Vegas in 2002. While on a bachelorette trip, she waltzed into a bar and laid eyes on the lawyer in a kilt. Neither of them knew the other was famous. She told People, "We caught eyes and smiled. The kilt was a novelty. The smile was all I needed."

He added, "We instantly got on like a house on fire. We went out to a nightclub — I wasn't allowed in because I was wearing a skirt! So we spent a bit of time walking around the streets and got to know each other really, really well."

Before they parted ways, they exchanged numbers. They wrote letters for a few months and went on a date in New York before he invited her to the UK to be his wedding date. At the time, he was still keeping his title under wraps "just to get to know someone and really like them irrespective of all of this," so she showed up to his family home, Powderham Castle, in "[her] brother's old cut-off jeans and a surfing beanie and a tank top." The couple wed in 2004. They have two kids, Joscelyn and Jack.

Throughout the '80s, Tracy Somerset (who acted under the name Tracy-Louise Ward and is also known as Tracy Worcester) appeared on TV series like C.A.T.S. Eyes, Doctor Who, and Cluedo. In 1987, she married Henry Somerset, Marquis of Worcester, who later became the 12th Duke of Beaufort. She retired from acting to start a family and dedicate her time to environmental causes. She told the Independent, "I was allowed to get out of earning a living, being an actress, and having to make money to pay my mortgage. I stopped all of that, and had a family, and felt free to think and do what I want... To be honest, I much more enjoy working with people and for people. Acting, for me, was very 'ego'. Am I any good, how big is the audience, do they want to buy a ticket for me? It was all about me."

The duke is also known as Harry Beaufort or Bunter Beaufort.
In 2018, Henry divorced Tracy and married journalist Georgia Powell. However, Tracy retained the title of Duchess of Beaufort and still lives in her own residence on the Badminton House estate. She continues her work as an environmental activist.

One major thing she disliked about royal life was sending her children to boarding school. Additionally, Harry was "not interested" in her work, and she did her "own thing."

In 1993, actor and singer Louise Robey — who most famously played Micki Foster on Friday the 13th: The Series — and Charles Beauclerk, Earl of Burford — who infamously spoke out during a 1999 House of Lords debate on the abolition of hereditary peers, calling it "treason" — met through their shared interest in the theory that Shakespeare's plays were actually written by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. After attending a lecture about the theory, Louise did her own research at the library. Then, she decided to attend a talk by one of Edward's descendants — Charles, who was a big proponent of the theory. Afterwards, they kept in touch.

She told the Mirror, "I was told he was a very serious man, a geek with no sense of humor. What I found was an intense-but-sensitive person with a dry wit. But more important to me, he was a man of poetic genius who wooed me with his mind... He was living in Boston because he was on a tour of America, and he would write to me all the time or send me sonnets by fax. When the tour ended and he went back to England, he invited me over and, of course, I went. By now, we were both head over heels in love. He would press flowers and send them to me and write such beautiful prose and poetry about me — who could resist? That's what I fell in love with. Not the title, not the money — I knew there wasn't any there anyway — and certainly not the lifestyle. It was an old-fashioned courtship based on love letters."
Matthew Fearn - PA Images / PA Images via Getty Images
The got married in 1994. However, Louise was "expected to conform overnight" and was "never coached on what was acceptable behavior." She said, "I was a Canadian Hollywood actress, and he was a Lord of the realm. I might as well have landed on Mars. Maybe they thought they could mold me, but I was not a naive teenager. I was a fully-grown woman with a mind of her own. I didn't fit into the mold of the Sloanie with a blonde bob and twinset and pearls. They didn't like my accent, the women hated my red hair. and they all loathed the fact that I had a brain... Maybe they felt I was good enough to have as a bit on the side or to produce an heir, like Nellie Gwyn, but not good enough to be an Earl's wife."

She allegedly struggled to be accepted by his family, even after welcoming their son. She also had to sell some of her treasured possessions to support them financially. She said, "He was the one who told me, 'It's over.' I would never have left him because of our son, James. It was a massive shock because, despite all our problems, it was so unexpected. I was in the kitchen preparing dinner. He came in and stood in the doorway and said rather melodramatically, 'I've been grieving for three weeks and I've decided we are getting divorced.' He told me we should have separated years ago, and I was devastated that he came out with this blanket statement with no warning. That's when I felt used by him and his family. I thought he married me because he cared. But now I believe he was with me because he wanted an heir — and I gave him a beautiful one." They divorced in 2001, and she now lives out of the public eye.

Charles Beauclerk told the Mirror, "This is a private matter, and I don't wish to comment."

Here's a celeb couple where both actors have ties to royalty: Rose Leslie is the daughter of Sebastian Arbuthnot-Leslie, the Aberdeenshire Chieftain of Clan Leslie in Scotland. Her husband, Kit Harington, is the son of Sir David Harington, 15th Baronet (the title will be inherited by Kit's older brother, John "Jack" Harington).

Rose and Kit knew each other before playing love interests on Game of Thrones, but Ygritte and Jon Snow's Season 2 romance helped sparks fly in real life. Kit told Vogue Italy, "The three weeks in Iceland when we were shooting the second season [are his best memory]. Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love. If you're already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love…"

In 2018, the couple got married at Lickleyhead Castle, where Rose grew up. The property has been in her family for 900 years. The couple has two children.

In July 2016, Meghan Markle was "really intent on being single and just having fun girl time" and traveling for the summer before returning to Suits. However, her single girl summer came to a swift end when one of her friends posted a picture of her with the Snapchat dog filter that caught Prince Harry's eye. After Harry asked about her, the friend emailed Meghan, "I know you said you're single, and a friend of mine asked about you, and maybe you'd like to meet him... [it's] Prince Haz."

Meghan Instagram-stalked Harry, whose feed was "just beautiful photography and all these environmental shots and this time he was spending in Africa." The pair began texting, and they were "constantly in touch." In the docuseries Harry & Meghan, the actor said, "I had a career, I had my life, I had a path, and then came H. Talk about a plot twist."

When Meghan was in London for Wimbledon later that summer, they finally went on a first date. The next day, they went out again before she had to leave. Afterwards, he told friends he'd found "the one." He proposed in October 2017. He said, "I wanted to do it earlier, but I had to ask permission from my grandmother. I couldn't do it outside of the UK. I did pop a bottle of champagne while she was greasing the chicken, and that kind of slightly gave the game away."

Meghan said, "Joining this family, I knew there was a protocol for how things were done. Do you remember that old movie, The Princess Diaries, with Anne Hathaway? There's no class, and some person who goes, 'Sit like this. Cross your legs like this. Use this fork. Don't do this. Curtsy then. Wear this kind of hat.' It doesn't happen, so I needed to learn a lot... There's no version of me joining this family and trying to not do everything I could to fit in. I don't want to embarrass the family."

In 2018, they got married at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, making them the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Three years later, the couple officially separated from the royal family, stepping down as working royals. They have two children, Archie and Lilibet.

Fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg and Prince Egon von Fürstenberg met at a birthday party when she was a student at the University of Geneva. She told Over the Moon, "He was handsome and blonde and a prince, yes, and he had this great smile, but I wasn't particularly interested at first. There were plenty of other young, good-looking men around, and he was still in school at Lausanne. But we ran in the same circles, and the more I got to know him, the more my feelings began to change. I'd say the turning point was on a ski trip we took to Megeve. The car got stuck in the snow, and Egon rushed to get help. It turned out not to be a big deal, but I couldn't help but be charmed by his helplessness and how he wanted to protect me. Before I knew it, I was very much in love."

They eventually broke up so she could "create [her] own life." In Paris, she worked as a photographer's assistant, but when Egon asked her to move to New York with him, she went. Then, in 1969, she accepted an apprenticeship in Italy. In Diane: A Signature Life, she wrote, "He gave me a ring, but I didn't really believe he was serious, nor was I in a terrible hurry to get married."

When Diane realized she was pregnant, she considered getting an abortion, but Egon reportedly sent her a telegram that said, "Marriage will occur the 15th of July. Organize it as rapidly as possible."

They got married in 1969. Diane told Over the Moon, "The ceremony took place at the town hall of Montfort-l'Amaury outside of Paris. It was followed by a big reception for 500 friends and relatives at Auberge de la Moutierè, a charming inn and restaurant that was owned by Maxim’s. My father hired all of the musicians from Rasputin, a Russian nightclub in Paris for the reception. It was all very festive and chic... Egon's father was pressured not to come to the reception because the head of the Furstenberg family did not approve of my being Jewish, so that was a bit of a cloud over the wedding. But both of our mothers were supportive. I never doubted Egon or our love for one another, and that was the important thing."

They divorced in 1983 but remained close friends until his death in 2004. Diane's fashion career took off after their split. She told W Magazine, "Usually the fairy tale ends with the girl marrying the prince. But mine started as soon as the marriage was over."

In 1948, Prince Aly Khan, the son of Aga Khan III, was determined to meet Rita Hayworth after watching Gilda. So, gossip columnist Elsa Maxwell arranged for them to meet at one of her famous parties. At the time, both Aly and Rita were married to other people (though Rita's husband, Orson Welles, was living with another woman, and Aly had just ended an affair), and she was also being courted by the Shah of Iran and business magnate Aristotle Onassis. Aly spent the entire party at the actor's side, and she went back to his villa, Château de l'Horizon, with him afterwards.

The Aga Khan is the imam (spiritual leader) of Ismaili Muslims, akin to the Pope in Catholicism or the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism.
The next day, Aly had to leave for Ireland. While Rita awaited his return to France, a fortune-teller visited and told her she was "about to embark on the greatest romance of her life" with "someone she already knew," and that she "must relent and give in to him totally" in order to "find happiness at long last." Convinced, the actor stayed with Aly until she had to go back to California for work. On a trip to Spain, he proposed, but she said no and returned to Hollywood. However, he followed her and purchased the house across the street from hers, so their affair continued.
Bettmann / Bettmann Archive / Via Getty
Aly's father pressured him to end the relationship, but after meeting Rita (who was pregnant at the time) in person, he gave his approval. So, Aly divorced his current wife, and he and Rita tied the knot in 1949.

However, marriage didn't stop Aly from cheating, gambling, and burning through so much money that his dad sent the couple on a three-month trip to visit the African Ismaili communities to give them a better understanding of their position. On the trip, they fought often, and he kept cheating. Eventually, she left, packed up her things in France, and took her children back to the US. Then, she sought a divorce, which was granted in 1953.

Actor Sophie Winkleman, who's appeared in movies like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and Wonka and on shows like Peep Show, met Lord Frederick Windsor on New Year's Eve in 2006. She told Tatler, "We were leaving two different parties, and we went for the same taxi. His very first words to me were, 'You're Big Suze, I love you!' I looked back at this ridiculously beautiful face and thought, 'Oh God. Hello, everyone. I'm going to be in trouble here.' It was quite Richard Curtis."

Big Suze was her Peep Show character.
They dated for two yeara before he popped the question with his grandmother Princess Marina's ring. They held their 2009 wedding at Hampton Court Palace.

She said, "I didn't know anyone at my wedding. I had my best pals there, but basically, it was full of faces I'd never seen before. My mother-in-law, Princess Michael of Kent, took full personal charge of it all and did it brilliantly, including what dress I was wearing. I was so determined not to be a bridezilla, I didn't even work out my hairstyle, and I cannot tell you how disgusting it looked. Coming up the aisle, the first thing I said when I saw Freddie was, 'I'm so sorry about the hair.' He said, 'Yes, what on earth have you done?' That's pretty much all I can remember about it. My hair and being such a moron. But it was such a beautiful place." They have two daughters, Maud and Isabella.

Emma McQuiston and Ceawlin Thynn, 8th Marquess of Bath, first crossed paths at a family wedding when she was 3 and he was 15. Then, in 2011, at ages 25 and 37, they re-met as adults at Soho House in London. Soon after, they started dating.
David M. Benett / Getty Images
A year later, they got engaged, making Emma the then-future first Black British marchioness. She told Vanity Fair, "I was made more 'aware of myself,' from the outside in, when I got engaged. I don't want to not acknowledge the significance, because it has meant a lot to a lot of people. It was a moment in history that people got a lot of hope and encouragement from. But I didn't do anything on purpose. I just have to appreciate that I've been written to personally, and seen it written about, and it's been taken very seriously."

Ceawlin said he didn't feel trepidatious about making their relationship public "for a moment." He said, "From my perspective — and with hindsight I can see that it was incredibly naïve — I absolutely believed that in the UK, we lived in a post-racial society... Not saying there weren't ripples. You're probably aware of one in particular."

When the couple got married at Longleat in 2013, his parents opted to attend a different wedding altogether. Out of his immediate family, only his immediate sister, Lady Lenka Thynn, showed up.

Ceawlin alleged to the Times that, after he told his mother, Anna Thynn, about the engagement, she asked, "Are you sure about what you're doing to 400 years of bloodline?" then repeated it twice more. He said that, when he told Emma, it was "the first time she had ever had to think about her race." Ultimately, he made Anna "return the wedding invitation and made it clear that under no circumstances would she be attending." He said, "Emma is the least confrontational, least dramatic person, but I don't think anyone could have that happen at least three times, and not just say, well, f*** this."

Anna told the outlet that she always shared her thoughts about her children's "serious partners" and that she didn't know she'd been uninvited to the wedding.In a separate interview, she told the Times that she never used the word "bloodline" because "I don't even know that word. I am not English." For context, she's Hungarian.She said, "Of course I understand what it means. You'd have to be idiotic not to understand 'bloodline.' But I didn’t use that word because it is not part of my [vocabulary]. So I said to my husband, 'Is bloodline right?' To me, it has got a nasty slant to it... I have not got a problem with racism."
Emma is now known as Emma Thynn, Marchioness of Bath as well as Viscountess Weymouth. She and Ceawlin have two sons, John and Henry.

While on the way to the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, Grace Kelly made a pitstop in Monaco to pose for pictures with the royal family. Sparks flew with Prince Rainier III of Mónaco, and they kept in touch via letter. Seven months later, while spending Christmas with her family in Pennsylvania, he proposed. To marry the prince, she reportedly had to pay the House of Grimaldi a $2 million dowry (equal to an estimated $23.5 million today), which ate up her savings.

In 1956, 30 million viewers watched the televised "royal wedding of the century." Afterwards, Princess Grace of Monaco retired from acting, having been released from her contract in exchange for giving MGM Studios the international broadcasting rights for her wedding. The couple had three children, Caroline, Albert, and Stéphanie, and they were together until Grace's death in 1982.

In 2000, Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock met Albert II, Prince of Monaco, at the Mare Nostrum swimming meet. He told Paris Watch, "I don't know if we fell in love back then. You know, after that, I didn't see Charlene again for several years. I thought that she was an excellent swimmer and that she was friendly, cheerful, and approachable."
Gallo Images / Gallo Images via Getty Images
She told Vogue, "It was incredibly flattering. After seeing me swim, Albert asked my management for permission to take me out. We spent the whole evening laughing and talking." However, they didn't stay in touch, and five years passed before they crossed paths again in Cape Town. She said, "On New Year's Day, he officially asked me out. Our first public appearance was at the Torino Olympic Games in February 2006 ...Albert put me at ease. It was clear that we shared the same passions; we both became very emotional watching the athletes. Sport is the common denominator of our lives."

They tied the knot in a three-day ceremony in 2011. The former swimming champ is now known as Charlene, Princess of Monaco. The couple has twins, Gabriella and Jacques.

In 2003, the couple, who were expecting a child at the time, got married in Rome. Prince Albert was Emanuele's best man. The Princess of Venice told the newspaper Corriere della Sera, "I will work under my name, and I will be Clotilde of Savoy to advance humanitarian causes... Our love is strong, it will carry us far."
