I absolutely love the internet, and here’s why: every day I learn something new. Some of it’s serious, some of it’s kind of gruesome, and some of it’s so unhinged and funny that it literally knocks my socks off.

On my latest late-night internet rabbit hole, I stumbled upon the story of Listerine and how it was originally created for something completely different than what we use it for today. And I can say with absolute certainty that none of you would guess it. Honestly, nothing could have prepared me for that one piece of information.

So, of course, I dug deeper to look for more gems like it.
Here are some products that became wildly successful just because people didn’t use them the way they were supposed to.
1.
Listerine went from antiseptic and floor cleaner to mouthwash after a 1920s ad campaign turned “bad breath” into a public crisis.

Listerine wasn’t always the stuff you swish after brushing. Back in 1879, it was cooked up as a surgical antiseptic, then spent some time as a wound cleaner, a floor disinfectant, and—wait for it—a gonorrhea cure. But it didn’t blow up until the 1920s, when the company rebranded it as the fix for “chronic halitosis” (aka bad breath). With ads warning that stinky breath could wreck your love life, Listerine basically guilt-tripped its way into every bathroom cabinet.
2.
Play-Doh only became a toy after kids started playing with a wallpaper cleaner.

I was today years old when I learned Play-Doh wasn’t made for kids at all—it was actually a wallpaper cleaner back in the 1930s. But as coal heating disappeared, so did its purpose. Teachers then spotted kids having a blast molding the putty, and by the 1950s it was rebranded as a toy. The rest is colorful, squishy history.
3.
Vibrators were invented as “medical devices” long before they hit bedrooms.

This one's probably the most known of accident. In the late 19th century, doctors used early vibrators to “treat” women diagnosed with “hysteria”, basically a catch-all for any mood or stress issue. What was meant to be a medical procedure somehow evolved into one of the most popular bedroom gadgets ever. Talk about a case of science accidentally getting super personal.
4.
Corn Flakes were invented to curb… sexual desires. Seriously.

I couldn’t make this up. Corn Flakes weren’t meant to be a fun breakfast. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg created them at his health spa in the late 1800s because he believed bland, boring food could stop people from, well, doing naughty things. The idea was that sugary or flavorful food would spark unhealthy desires, so he made plain flaked cereal as a “moral breakfast.” Luckily for the rest of us, his brother Will sweetened things up a bit, and suddenly Corn Flakes became the morning staple we actually enjoy.
5.
Graham Crackers were invented to keep people “moral” and no I am not kiddding.

Graham Crackers weren’t meant to be a snack at all. Back in the 1800s, a preacher named Sylvester Graham invented them as part of a super bland diet designed to curb “unhealthy” urges, including sexual desires. Somehow, people started sweetening them with honey, chocolate, and marshmallows, and boom, s’mores and snack time were born.
6.
Ozempic’s journey started with a hormone in Gila monster venom.

This one had me staring at my screen for five minutes straight, trying to process what I’d just discovered. Turns out, Ozempic’s story doesn’t just begin in a lab, it starts with the venom of a Gila monster. Scientists studying the lizard’s spit found a hormone that helped regulate blood sugar, which eventually led to the creation of drugs for type 2 diabetes. But during trials, researchers noticed something unexpected: people were also losing weight. That “side effect” is what turned Ozempic (and its sibling Wegovy) into today’s buzziest weight-management drugs, all thanks to a lizard and a happy medical accident.
7.
Super Glue was almost a total failure, until it stuck the right way.

Super Glue wasn’t invented to fix mugs or crafts. Back in the 1940s, a chemist was trying to make clear plastic for gun sights and accidentally created an insanely sticky adhesive that bonded to everything… including his own fingers. People thought it was a nuisance at first, but once someone realized it could hold stuff together like magic, Super Glue became the household hero we all rely on today.
8.
Bubble Wrap wasn’t born to protect packages—it started as wallpaper.

Bubble Wrap wasn’t invented for shipping at all. Back in 1957, two engineers created it by sealing shower curtains together, hoping to make a trendy textured wallpaper. Spoiler: nobody wanted bubble walls. But when IBM needed a way to ship their computers safely in the ’60s, Bubble Wrap finally found its calling. And now? It’s less about wallpaper and more about the joy of pop, pop, pop.
9.
Silly Putty was born from a failed attempt to make rubber during WWII.

I always thought Silly Putty was just some random toy cooked up for kids, but nope. It actually came out of World War II, when scientists were trying to make synthetic rubber for military purposes and accidentally ended up with this stretchy, bouncy goo. Totally useless for the military, but once kids got their hands on it in the 1950s, it became a squishy playground favorite.
10.
Botox started as a treatment for crossed eyes before becoming Hollywood’s wrinkle fixer.

I always assumed Botox was created just to smooth out wrinkles, but that’s not how it began. In the late 1980s, doctors were using it to treat crossed eyes and muscle spasms. Then patients (and their doctors) noticed something wild—the injections also made frown lines disappear. That happy accident turned Botox into the go-to beauty treatment it is today.
11.
WD-40 was made to prevent rust on rockets, not to fix squeaky doors.

WD-40 was literally born in a rocket lab. Back in 1953, scientists were trying to keep Atlas missiles from rusting, and after 39 failed attempts, the “40th formula” finally worked. That spray was supposed to stay in aerospace, but workers kept sneaking it home to fix stuff around the house. Before long, WD-40 jumped from protecting rockets to living under everyone’s kitchen sink.
12.
A tea bag was actually just loose tea packaged in a pouch which was accidentally tossed into a cup of water.

Imagine ordering loose tea and getting it in little silk pouches instead of tins. That’s exactly what happened in the early 1900s, when a tea merchant named Thomas Sullivan sent out samples in tiny bags. Instead of emptying the tea into a pot, people just dunked the whole bag in hot water and loved how easy it was. What began as a packaging shortcut turned into the way most of us make tea today.
13.
7UP was basically a mood soda before it was a lemon-lime refreshment.

I always assumed 7UP was just a fizzy lemon-lime drink, but nope. When it launched in 1929, it was actually called “Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda” and contained lithium citrate, a chemical used to treat mood swings. People were basically drinking their antidepressant without realizing it. The lithium got booted in the 1930s, but 7UP survived and became the soda we (probably) actually enjoy today.
