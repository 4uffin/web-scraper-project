It's safe to say that back in the day, things were a lot different. The pressures of society were a lot more intense, and a lot more scrutinized. A lot of things that were considered "common" back then would absolutely not be tolerated in the year 2025.

And yet some things are back in full force, but I digress.
So when this Reddit post started gaining some traction, I wanted to see how much society has changed in regards to "forced" marriages. For the record, we're not talking about "arranged" marriages that is common in other cultures. Let's see some of the top responses!

"Not exactly in the way most people think of it. I was working for my first police department in 1975. My wife-to-be and I were living merrily in sin… She’d just gotten divorced and was a bit shy of marriage and we were committed anyway. But the bluenosed department administration found out that we were 'cohabiting' and they couldn’t have that! I got a letter saying either get married or quit. So, we got married legally by a circuit judge, and had our own ceremony at the bar where we me. A good time was had by all. BTW… We lasted 50 years. My wife passed away early last month."

"I got married to escape my parents. I walked out of the frying pan and into the fire. I tolerated the abuse for 28 years. No one knows how fucking scared you are to leave, more than you are to stay. I’ve been single for 17 years."

"I was 20 and my girlfriend was 18 when she got pregnant. We now have 3 children, 4 grandchildren, 3 great-grandchildren, and celebrated our 59th wedding anniversary earlier this year. It doesn't always turn out badly."

"My grandma is still alive; she is 97. She got pregnant at 20 and had to get married as a result. The marriage failed spectacularly; he was pretty jealous and apparently accused her of going to meet other men even when she was just walking down the street with my mum, and a baby in the pram. But mostly, they were just not compatible. They split up so quickly that my mum didn't know he was her father until she was in her twenties."
"However, my grandma said that it was normal then that once you were married, that was it, there was no going back if you were unhappy, you were expected to stick it out. But her dad told her she could come home, so she did. I never met my great-grandfather but when she told me that, my heart melted for him."—amandacheekychops

"I only knew one guy in college who had to marry to save face. Had one girlfriend who married to escape from the drama of her parent's house to enter the drama of a fundamentalist hermit who wanted her to breed a church of kids. She escaped after three."

"I did. I will say, I regretted it for a few years, all the while staying because I had three children with him. We managed 4 years of marriage counseling and nearly divorced numerous times. Made it to the other side, and I have never been more in love and more happy with anyone in my life. And we both feel this way. It was worth the fight to figure it out for us. We are now 17 years in, and I'd do it all over to have him and my family."

"I was a waiting to wed in 1984, moved in with him and got a 'shut up' ring in late 1982, but he kept moving the wedding date. Diaphragms don't work when you leave them in the drawer. Oops. We were both overjoyed and got married 3 months later. I was 31 and my bio clock had been driving me nuts since I'd finished my actuarial exams so there was no question I was having this kid."
"But my husband was a difficult man — always had been. He was an alcoholic, controlling, and was unemployed the last 5 years of the marriage. We divorced in 1997. So, it ended in flames.Right now I have a wonderful son, 3 grandchildren I love, a daughter-in-law who's the daughter I never had, and more money than I need. Life is good. So, in the end it worked out, but there were some bumps in the road."—CleanCalligrapher223

"Kind of had to. We would have just lived together otherwise, but as we were both from different countries, the only way we could live together long-term was to marry. We had, however, been good friends for 5 years before that and knew each other really well. It all worked out; we're still together 17 years later."

"We got married in 1977 and the baby was born a year later. Still married and doing great. Our 50th anniversary will be in 2027!"

"We met on a blind date when I came home from college for Thanksgiving my junior year of college. Married 2 days after my 21st birthday, the following September. I had to leave to go back to school 2.5 hours away a few days after the wedding. Did not have the time or the funds for a honeymoon. Our son was born in February. After graduation, I continued my education for an additional year to obtain a second degree. I was fortunate to complete my studies back home. We will be married 44 years this September. We have three successful children and one grandchild. We recently retired after my career in healthcare, and hers as a travel agent. We built our home, traveled, sent our children to college (paid all tuition) and have a comfortable retirement."
"We have shared and separate hobbies. She was and still is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. We have always had shared values. Never had a disagreement about finances. How did it turn out? I wouldn’t change anything."—Pheasant-tail

"We didn't 'have to' — we chose to. After only knowing each other for 3 months, and finding out that she was pregnant, we just dove right into it. We're still together after 46 years, and look at each other the same way we did the night that we met. With only slightly deteriorated vision."

"When I was in high school, my friend was taken by an ambulance from her fast-food job to the hospital for an appendicitis attack. She had a baby that night. I went to see her at home a couple of days later, and she and her boyfriend were planning their wedding. I think their son was 3 weeks old when they got married. We all grew up and lost touch with each other, but I ran into her husband about 20 years later. They were still married and he was clearly still completely head over heels in love with her. Shotgun wedding? Kind of. But such a fun love story."

"Danish 16–17-year-old tourists came to my area on vacation in the '60s. My father and his friends of the same age had a good time. 3 months later, the police rang the doorbell. One of the girls was pregnant. Everyone at the police station was trying to find out who slept with who. Living in a region where words have value, everyone promised to marry the girl if it was him."
"It happened to a friend of my father. 60 years later, when you ask him in hindsight what he regrets about this, he'll tell you that it's having to learn a complicated foreign language. They had 5 children and had their first great-granddaughter in March.They're a really cute couple."—Infinite-Set-7853

"Found out I was pregnant 10 days after my 19th birthday. Didn’t tell my parents until I was about 5 months pregnant. Everyone told me to 'get married before the baby is born.' Got married 2 months later. He was an alcoholic with undiagnosed mental problems who abused me and the kids. But 'you get married, you stay married.' I did for almost 10 years before I got the courage to leave. He wound up drinking himself to death by age 39. I paid for him to be cremated and buried because that’s what the kids wanted. Never again."

"I got pregnant at 31, and even though I did not want to get married, I did it to secure better health/dental benefits for my child. I’m still married to the same guy, had another kid, and still love him, 31 years later."

"Me and my husband were not planning on getting married. But as we approached retirement, it became apparent that the government’s indifference toward healthcare issues would leave us vulnerable. So we got gay married to pool our coverage. It’s been great! Thanks, government! I’m sure that’s what you intended for us all along."

"I ran away to escape abuse at home when I was 16. I met a guy and wanted to get married. My dad signed off on it and I married my 23-year-old statutory rapist. I realized it was a mistake within weeks. But I got pregnant and didn't believe in divorce and certainly thought that abortion was murder. He abused me brutally, but I didn't know anything different. It came to a head when he was chasing me and my daughter stepped out of her room. When he lunged at her, it flipped a switch in me. Somehow, I had the instinct to protect my kids but not myself."
"I left the next day and spent the next 7 years fighting him in court. His grandparents had money and they wanted him to get custody. CPS kept him on supervised visitation, but that didn't prevent him from harming the kids. The judge finally accepted their testimony when my youngest turned 12 and terminated his visitation.Pure hell on earth for all of us because one shitty loser needed to be in control to feel anything."—InformalVermicelli42

And finally, "She got pregnant and had our child before she could immigrate to my country. So basically we had a family before we lived together or really knew each other well. I love my son. He saved my life in many ways. But I had much less in common with my wife as I came to realize. Too late. We had more kids which meant more childcare time, and less time with her. It was over 20 years before I finally accepted that it was not a healthy relationship and we would never be happy. She refused marriage counseling, so we got divorced. Finally. Best decision in a long time."
