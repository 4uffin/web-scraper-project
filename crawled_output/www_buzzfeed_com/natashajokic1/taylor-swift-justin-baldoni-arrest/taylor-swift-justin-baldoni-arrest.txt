A man was arrested for criminal trespassing on Travis Kelce's property while allegedly attempting to serve Taylor Swift with deposition papers on behalf of Justin Baldoni's lawyers earlier this month.

Justin is currently embroiled in a legal battle with his It Ends With Us costar, Blake Lively, after she accused the actor and director of sexual harassment and a retaliatory smear campaign. Justin's team has since claimed that Blake used her friendship with Taylor to try and exert control over the movie.

Taylor's team has maintained that she has nothing to do with the case, writing in a letter to the judge earlier this month, "Since the inception of this matter, we have consistently maintained that my client has no material role in this action."

Nevertheless, Justin's team claimed that Taylor had agreed to be deposed, which Taylor's team quickly denied. A judge then ruled on Sept. 12 that Taylor would not be deposed in the case.

Following news of an arrest made on Travis's property shortly after, the Leawood Police Department said in a statement to BuzzFeed, "On September 15, 2025, shortly after 2AM, Leawood, Kansas police officers were dispatched to a private gated neighborhood in the 11600 block of Pawnee Lane to investigate a trespassing incident. Officers arrived and contacted an adult male within the gated community. The male was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of criminal trespassing and released after posting bond." Further documents provided by the department confirm that the arrest took place in Travis's home.

The news that the man, a private investigator, was trespassing in order to try to serve deposition papers from Justin's team was first reported by Star.

It's worth noting that the date of arrest was three days after a judge denied Justin's team's extension to depose Taylor. This means that after a judge ruled that Taylor would not be deposed in the case, a man still went on Travis's property and seemingly attempted to serve her with papers in the early hours of the morning.

â€œ[I] wasnâ€™t hurt or anything besides being arrested for doing my job and possibly losing my [private eye] license," the PI subsequently told Star.

News of the arrest comes amid reports that a man against whom Taylor has a restraining order for stalking cannot currently be found by a private investigator hired to help Taylor.
