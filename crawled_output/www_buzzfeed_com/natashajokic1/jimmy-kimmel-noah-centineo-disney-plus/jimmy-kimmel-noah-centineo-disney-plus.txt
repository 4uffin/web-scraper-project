Last week, Jimmy Kimmel Live! was pulled indefinitely by Disney (ABC's parent company). The talk show host had previously said on the show, ‚ÄúWe hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.‚Äù The Trump-friendly chair of the FCC subsequently threatened penalties over the comment.

Subsequently, some have been calling for a boycott of Disney+. This includes She-Hulk: Attorney at Law actor Tatiana Maslany, and, now, Noah.

The To All the Boys alum shared a screenshot of his canceled Disney+ subscription captioned, "Save money today."

The move even received some positive attention from his fans:

Except for one small thing: Noah's screenshot showed that the actor still had access to Disney+ for an entire year.

Subsequently, some wondered whether Noah had purchased a yearlong subscription, only to then show that he'd cancel it:

Meanwhile, 400 Hollywood types have just signed an open letter by the ACLU condemning Disney's suspension of Kimmel. I'm sure the strongly-worded letter will work this time, guys!
BuzzFeed has reached out to representatives for Noah for comment.
