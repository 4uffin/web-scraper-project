Last week, Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended indefinitely after the host's comments on the shooter of Charlie Kirk's motives drew the ire of the chair of the FCC. ‚ÄúWe hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,‚Äù Kimmel said in one of his opening monologues. ‚ÄúIn between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.‚Äù

Yesterday, ABC's parent company Disney said of its choice to temporarily suspend the show, "It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday." However, about a quarter of local ABC stations still won't be airing tonight's show as of right now.

Throughout this, Kimmel has kept quiet ‚Äî until, earlier today, he posted an image on Instagram with Norman Lear captioned, "Missing this guy today."

Lear was a TV writer and producer who died in 2023. As People notes, he was outspoken against the FCC and even co-signed a successful lawsuit against the government organization after it tried to institute "family viewing time" rules over content. He was even on the "enemies list" of President Richard Nixon and founded the progressive organization People for the American Way.

Kimmel previously paid tribute to Lear in an emotional 2023 taping of his show, saying, "He taught us so much about so many serious things, always making us laugh while he did it, and everyone who works in or even watches television owes him a great debt. Especially me.‚Äù
