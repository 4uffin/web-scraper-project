I miss my small, cute teeth!"by haein_jungBuzzFeed ContributorFacebookPinterestLink
Beauty trends come and go, but some should be left in the past. Whether it's chemicals that are way too harsh on our skin, or trends that leave a more permanent change on our bodies, when someone asked in r/beauty, "What trend do you regret buying into?" folks wrote in on the products and procedures they wish they'd never opened their wallets for. Here's what people had to say:
1.
"Eyelash extensions. I spent way too much time and money getting them, and ended up with a reaction on my eyelids that still flares up a year later."

2.
"2000s skincare. There was no focus on moisturizer or skin barriers at all."

—Crafty-Judge-896"I thought only old ladies with super dry skin wore moisturizer. That's what it seemed like anyway."—MarsailiPearl"There was a focus, but it was on St. Ives apricot scrub."—Aprissitee"Stridex, Oxy, then Noxzema. Sounds like we’re selling something nefarious in a back alley."—NelzyBellz

"10-step routines."

"I have to reach back to the '80s, but Sun In. I’m a dark brunette, and ended up with electric orange hair. So ugly!"

—Wonderful_Horror7315"Same! And it FRIED my hair so not only was it electric orange, it was frizzy and broken, too. I looked like a Cheeto puff."—Tubbygoose
9.
"Going blonde. It didn't suit me, and now I have to grow back all of it from the start, and I think I just realized that this effort is not worth it."
—lLaara
10.
"Olaplex. A friend of mine said it would be so good for my hair, but it ruined it. But hey, at least I know more about haircare now. I was so clueless."

—Cheesus_22"Olaplex — specifically no. 3 — actually dries your hair when you use it. That’s why it's advised to use it on damp hair before BOTH shampoo and conditioning. The reason is that it needs to expand the hair strands for the formula to reach the cortex and work properly.Olaplex is meant to only be used if you actually need it. Usually, for people with chemically treated hair. I’d go a step further and say mostly for bleached hair. And to add, Olaplex is meant to be used as a whole system with 1, 2, and 3, and following it up with 4 and 5, the shampoo and conditioner.When Olaplex was on the rise, while expanding its line, a lot of people who didn’t need it bought into the hype and had complaints that it ruined their hair. There is no need for Olaplex on virgin hair or even just hair that has been damaged through thermal or mechanical means."—edenfever
11.
"Trying the 'no oils or butters' hair trend. I live in a cold climate, so it's just not feasible for me. My hair ended up dry and breaking off."
—OrangeSun01
12.
"Tanning. Now, I’m living with regrets."
MTV / Via youtube.com
"I worked in a tanning salon when I was young, and now I'm dealing with the repercussions of indoor tanning like precancerous lesions. I'm aware that it's my fault, but it doesn’t make it suck less."—TerribleAwareness158
13.
"Tretinoin destroyed my skin because my skin's way too sensitive."
—[deleted]"This! It’s not for everyone. There are so many Retin-A/vitamin A formulas out there, and Tretinoin isn’t for every skin type, no matter how you apply it! I’ve been prescribed many types through the years, and I once asked my GP to give me a new script for one I used successfully years before, but it turned out to no longer be the right one for me. Oof, that was awful! So glad I’m using the proper one now."—No_Damage_2950

"Dermaplaning. Never had breakouts as bad as doing that — and I tried it twice, for fuck's sake."

15.
"Over-exfoliating with glycolic acid. Even one to two times a week KILLED my moisture barrier."
—tambourine_goddess
16.
"I was heavy into contouring. Even at my skinniest when I didn’t need it, it made me look worse. In pictures, it made me look like a ghoul, LOL."

"Permanent makeup. They're like neon orange. I don’t even have red hair anymore, and they’re a pain in the ass to color correct with makeup. Fucking hate them."
—Mindless_Homework
18.
"Microbladed brows. I hate mine and waiting for them to fade. They're blue."
—QueensGirl205
19.
"Buying too much highlighter for my already oily skin. I would rather just use a base product with some glow and then my natural oils will come through."

And finally, "Brow lamination. I looked SO STUPID."
