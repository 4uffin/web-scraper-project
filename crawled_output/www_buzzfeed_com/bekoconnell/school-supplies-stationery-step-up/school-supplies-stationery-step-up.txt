1. A pair of the *iconic* Kaco pens (known for their adorable heart tops) in your choice of Pantone color. They have every Color of the Year going back to 2000, so you can pick a year with sentimental value...like 2025, the year you discovered your new fave pen.Â AmazonPromising review: "Love the way this pen writes!! Itâ€™s so cute, too!" â€”IsabelGet them from Amazon for $13.99 (available in 25 colors).
2. Ticonderoga erasers shaped like classic yellow pencils offering a somewhat confusing notetaking experience. Unlike *some* novelty erasers, these actually get the job done, sans smudges.Â AmazonTiconderoga makes the best #2 pencils, IMO, so it makes sense their erasers are good too.Â Promising review: "This is the second school year I am buying these for my daughter because she loves them that much and they last the whole year. They are Ticonderoga, so of course they work the best of all the brands. (Their pencils are a teacherâ€™s first choice. ðŸ˜‰) They are so cute and cheap for as long as they last. Also, they donâ€™t leave a lot of residue, and when it comes to erasing, thatâ€™s huge!" â€”S. WallaceGet a pack of three from Amazon for $4.99.
3. And a set of erasers, including two blue rectangles that slowly transform into mini Mt. Fujis with use â€” so long as you erase strategically. You also get two white erasers for more intense mistakes. Reviewers say both styles work really well!Â AmazonPromising review: "Very cute and works well! Worth the money in my opinion, for the quality. One of the best erasers I have used for pencil drawing. Will buy again when needed." â€”Amazon CustomerGet a set of four from Amazon for $8.41.
4. Kutsuwa highlighter pencils that will have everyone swearing off the marker version for life. These offer more control, don't smudge or bleed, and don't get ink on your hands. Plus, they're just a really cool twist on a school supply classic!Â Â www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comPromising review: "I had no idea there was such a thing as a wooden pencil highlighter. These exceeded my expectations. The pencil is wood, so one less bit of plastic to end up in a landfill. The 'lead' part of the pencil appears to be a kind of waxy crayon-like material. It goes on like a dream. Just as useful as a traditional liquid felt-tip marker for highlighting. Because I had it handy, I used one today at work to mark a peg location to install a shelf. This bright highlighter pencil left a nice mark for me to locate the correct peg hole for the shelf, which wiped off easily from the metal once it was installed. 100% recommend! Definitely will buy again." â€”M. C.Get a pack of four from Amazon for $9.80.
5. A sweet pair of scissors housed in a fruit-shaped magnet holder that would look soooo cute on your fridge or your kid's locker. And maybe now you can actually find the darn things when you need them.Â AmazonI have the banana on my fridge! It's not the sharpest pair in the kitchen, but I love it as a magnet/decor piece.Â Promising review: "Super cute and actually comes in handy. Love that itâ€™s magnetic." â€”JoannaGet it from Amazon for $6.25 (available in four styles).
6. Journal stamps that add some extra structure to your agenda. The 18-piece kit comes with various designs that'll allow you or your type-A student to add the days of the week, star ratings, reading lists, and more.www.amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: "This is my first time purchasing a large stamp set on Amazon so I wasn't sure which set I should go with. I wanted something for journaling and this set seemed to have a nice variety of productivity stamps. I love the fact that they are rubber stamps, and they print clearly on paper. They're not too big or small either." â€”BeautybydesyGet a set of 18 from Amazon for $16.99.
7. A jumbo paper clip bookmark sure to make a STATEMENT. Good luck losing your place when rocking something so big and sturdy.Â Â Katie Young Art / EtsyKatie Young Art is a small Etsy shop that sells 3D-printed accessories.Â Promising review: "The clip is super cute, functional, and lightweight. I'm very pleased with my purchase!" â€”TeresaGet it fromÂ Katie Young Art on Etsy for $10 (available in 11 colors).
8. A pack of textured pencil sleeves with satisfying swirls and ridges kids and adults alike will love to play with while concentrating on work. These are great for people with anxiety, ADHD, autism, limited mobility, and more.Â www.amazon.comThese fit on most mechanical pencils, but not classic wooden ones.Â Promising review: "I bought these for my husband to help him focus at work. He loves them! They slip easily onto his pencils and allow him to fidget as needed. They fit most mechanical pencils and some smaller pens. I wish they came in different sizes so I could get them for his other writing utensils." â€”HollyGet a pack of four and two pencils from Amazon for $16.49 (available in three colorways).
9. AÂ weekly sticky notepad so you can plan out the whole week and then stick it somewhere visible for easy reference. It's a lil' less intrusive and more free-flowing than a traditional calendar, like an analog Google cal.Â Â Poketo Poketo is an LA-based, Asian Americanâ€“owned lifestyle shop from husband-and-wife team Ted Vadakan and Angie Myung.Get it from Poketo for $12.
10. Uniquely shaped Mr. Pen sharpeners with built-in erasers, because who doesn't love a multitasker? They're easy for small hands to hold and come with holes in the center, which I can only assume are for sick pen tricks.Â www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comPromising review: "Great little handy tool! I bought this to use for my sketchbook because I want to use a regular pencil. No need to carry a separate pencil sharpener and eraser anymore!" â€”patrickGet a pack of six from Amazon for $4.85.
11. Lifelines gel pens infused with essential oils and filled with lava lamp-like liquid. Now students can take a quick study break to zone the heck out.Â Amazon, www.amazon.comThe pens come in different colors, and some of the fragrance options include: green apple, woodsy, harvest spice, and coconut grove.Â Promising review: "These pens are so darn cute. The lava is so adorable, and the scent is just enough. Not too strong. The pen writes really well too." â€”Shopper GirlGet them from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in two styles and two pack sizes).
12. A Snoopy washi tape dispenserÂ (with matching tape!) to avoid classic, minor problems like ripping the tape at a weird angle, losing the edge, or not having enough cute Peanuts decor.Â WashiParadise / EtsyWashiParadise is based in Hong Kong and sells cute stationery.Â Get a dispenser and tape fromÂ WashiParadise on Etsy for $12.71 (available in four styles).
13. A pack of gel pens jam-packed with glitter in case school notes or agenda entries could use a lil' zhushing up. Reviewers love how smooth and pigmented they are.Â www.amazon.comPromising review: "These pens are amazing. The colors are bright and filled with glitter. They write smoothly, too! I wish the part where you hold the pen was a little more comfortable, but these pens are beautiful and worth every penny!! Buy them; you won't regret it!" â€”DustinGet them from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in six different styles and pack sizes).
14. An expanding file folderÂ for all your kids' homework assignments, field trip forms, and loose documents. As an accordion folder follower, I have to say these things are ALSO top-notch for adults who want to organize everything from restaurant menus to ticket stubs.Â AmazonPromising review: "I am going through some legal things, and this folder has been perfect for keeping all my paperwork together! And boy, can it hold a lot! The snap closure is very sturdy, and the color is spot on!! An amazing value and great quality!" â€”MomOf2Get it from Amazon for $6.98+Â (available in 16 colors).
15. A pack of twistable crayons that people have described as a crayon-oil pastel hybrid. They glide like silk and help you create decadent, vibrant masterpieces. But the real selling point? The adorable bear-shaped caps!Â www.amazon.com, www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comSee how the crayons work in this TikTok.Promising review: "I LOVE THESE! Smooth, blendable, and soooo many color options! You do have to wait a little bit for it to dry so it doesn't smear/smudge. It can also get a little messy, but that's the fun of creating! The twistable skinny pen shape makes it really easy to take care of your markers for fast cleanup. Twisting also makes it easy to use! Great design, beautiful colors, tons of options for making art!" â€”Shelby-LynneGet a pack of 24 from Amazon for $17.99.
16. A splurgeyÂ Logitech mechanical keyboardÂ you can gift your child in a last-ditch effort to convince them to take care of their poor wrists. It hasÂ nice, clackety keys, RGB backlighting, and comes with a cute wrist pillow that'll feel like resting on a cloud. I don't blame you if you find yourself using their computer whenever you wanna check your email.Â Â www.instagram.com, Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeedBuzzFeed editorÂ Jenae SitzesÂ says, "I've been using the wired version of this mechanical keyboard for months, both for gaming and for everyday work, and absolutely love it. I had a full-size keyboard before, so I really appreciate the more compact tenkeyless design of this keyboard (which fits on my desk better). The keys sound perfectly clicky and feel great to type on, and the cloud wrist rest keeps my wrists supported really comfortably. And even though I've been using wrist rest cloud for 8+ hours a day for so long, it still looks totally new! My favorite thing is undeniably the aesthetic, though. It's the prettiest keyboard I've ever had, in a really sleek and modern way. I highly recommend it, even if they only play on PC occasionally (like I said, it works great for WFH life too!).It comes in a sleek, gorgeous white, but you can get colored top plates (like the pink one I'm currently using, shown above) directly from Logitech's store forÂ $19.99!"Â Get it from Amazon for $92+Â (available in three styles, wired or wireless, and with or without a mouse).
17. A large pencil case with a gazillion different pockets and roomy compartments for everything your child could possibly need during a school day. Gel pens, markers, tape, scissors, and more will have a home! Gee, maybe you need one too for your crafting tools?Â www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comMy colleagueÂ Tasia BassÂ has this case and loves it: "I got this for myself when I started wanting to do art outside my home. I wanted something that was big and roomy but also could fit in my purse with a small sketchbook. This pencil case is just that.Â This case comes with a couple of pockets for your smaller items, as well as a spacious main compartment. The front unzips so you can stick pencils or pens into the loop easily.Â Once, to test out how much it could fit, I had about 15 pencils, an entire travel watercolor set, several erasers, and a variety of markers at the same time and it zipped and closed up perfectly fine. I actually think this could be a good travel makeup bag too."Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 20 colors).
18. Or aÂ plush lobster pencil caseÂ featuring a zippered smile that is just â€” OK, I need a minute â€” TOO CUTE! It might not fit a ton of stuff, but how many pens does one person really need?Urban OutfittersGet it from Urban Outfitters for $30.
19. A pack of pastel pencils with dyed wood, so when you sharpen them, they produce lil' rainbow arches. They're made with #2 HB graphite so Scantron tests are about to get a whole lot more whimsical.Â Â AmazonPromising review: "I have been a teacher for 21 years and this is the best pencil! These pencils are solid and write so nicely. They are the new favorite!" â€”C. BlaskoGet a pack of 12 from Amazon for $8.89.
20. A pack ofÂ adorably-illustrated sticky notesÂ complete with speech bubbles, because passive-aggressive notes seem a lot more friendly when they come from an ice cream bunny.Â Little OtsuLittle Otsu is a small business based in Portland, Oregon, that's family-owned and co-owned by an Asian American woman!Â Get it from Little Otsu for $4.95.
21. An XL gluestick for massive projects that need more than a lil' adhesive. Small children may need to use both hands when holding this thing, which is really cute to imagine.Â Â www.amazon.comPromising review: "Great glue for junk journals. You can cover large areas quickly with these giants. It does dry quickly, so you don't want to mess about once you have the glue down. GREAT value for the amount of glue in each stick." â€”RoniGet it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two styles and two pack sizes).
22. AÂ huge mechanical pencil setÂ featuring six pencils, two widths of graphite refills, nine eraser toppers, and three gradient-style erasers. The whole kit has a dreamy pastel theme that's sure to make you swoon.Â www.amazon.comPromising review: "Purchased this for my teen daughter to have some cute pencils for school. Very well made. She said the lead just slides across the paper. Erasers erase and don't just smudge. Great quality for the price!" â€”KdgMomGet it from Amazon for $7.99 (available in two styles).
23. A mechanical calculator with typewriter-style keys that'll make crunching the numbers oh-so satisfying. Whether your kiddo needs to do some quick calculations or you need to check their math homework, this battery-powered gadget will make everyone feel like an old-timey accountant.Â www.amazon.comThe battery is included!Promising review: "Iâ€™ve had this calculator for over a year now and still going strong! I havenâ€™t changed the batteries since! Four of my coworkers loved it so much that they purchased their own. The buttons are smooth, and I love the clicking sound. The color is pretty true to the picture, a soft pink. Great quality!" â€”EllieGet it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in 19 colors).
24. A set of 10 retractable Crayola markers, which honestly should have always existed. How many of us suffered the fate of losing a marker cap or attempted to color only to find the red has completely dried out? Kids these days have it easy â€” just click and a fresh marker tip pops out, ready for art.Â www.amazon.comPromising review: "I love retractable markers. No more looking for caps and making sure they go on the right colors. Just click to open and click to close. Easy enough for my daughter to manage on her own. Nice quality, bright colors. Definitely worth a purchase." â€”LisaBGet a pack of 10 from Amazon forÂ $11.27+ (available in two color packs).
25. A big pack ofÂ tempera paint sticksÂ that are easier to handle than paintbrushes and are just sooo satisfying to use. They glide easily, dry fast, and have vibrant hues that show up on even unconventional canvases, like pumpkins.Â www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comThe Pencil Grip is a small business!Promising review: "Best invention almost ever (thereâ€™s still sliced bread). I mean how can you go wrong with paint in a stick?!! I mean certainly a toddler can go wrong with it. A toddler can go wrong somehow with a spaghetti noodle!!! But seriously, I saw these paint sticks at one of our local art galleries and it was an immediate MUST HAVE!!! Vibrant colors and they fit in little hands SO well!!! My kiddo loves them and so does her Momma!!" â€”RNinMD70Get a pack of 24 pens from Amazon for $22.
