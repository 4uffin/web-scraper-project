Halsey. Brendon Urie. Lady Gaga. Cynthia Erivo. What do these celebs have in common? Answer: They’ve all come out as bisexual, confidently owning their attraction to all genders.

They say sexuality is a spectrum. And if you fall somewhere around the middle, that makes you bisexual. But just how bi are you? Are you more heteroromantic-leaning, or are you like Frank Ocean, who is more homosexual-leaning?

If you aren't really sure how bi you are, taking this quiz can help you get the answers you're seeking. Remember, bisexuality means attraction to more than one gender, so if you're attracted to men, women, nonbinary baddies, trans cuties and any other gender identity under the sun, you can still identify as bisexual!
But whatever label you choose is all about your own comfort.
