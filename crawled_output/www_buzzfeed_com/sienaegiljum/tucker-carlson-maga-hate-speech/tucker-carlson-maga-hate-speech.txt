It's been a truly wild week, my friends. And although I wish I could say that nothing surprises me anymore, that would be a lie.

In the wake of the fatal shooting of political activist Charlie Kirk last week, some politicians on the right have been keen to deliver consequences to people they determine are "celebrating" Kirk's death. Here's a tweet from Rep. Nancy Mace applauding the firing of three Clemson University employees who she said were "cheering for assassinations."

Just yesterday, Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was pulled from the air due to threats from the FCC over his comments about the potential political leanings of the shooter. And among the voices sounding the alarm on the dissolution of the right to free speech is conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.
Carlson appeared with a strong message on the subject earlier this week on his podcast, The Tucker Carlson Show. A particular clip from the show has since gone viral on X.
"You hope that Charlie Kirk's death won't be used by a group we now call bad actors to create a society that was the opposite of the one he worked to build," he says in the clip. "You hope that."

"You hope that a year from now, the turmoil we're seeing in the aftermath of his murder won't be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country."

"And trust me, if it is, if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that. And there never will be," Carlson says.

"Because if they can tell you what to say, they're telling you what to think, there is nothing they can't do to you, because they don't consider you human. They don't believe you have a soul."

"A human being with a soul, a free man, has a right to say what he believes," he says at the end of the clip. "Not to hurt other people, but to express his views."

Carlson, who carved a name for himself as a right-leaning talking head, largely on Fox News, made some serious waves online with his statement.
One viral tweet about the clip read, "Hell has frozen over. Tucker Carlson is calling out the fascist authoritarian Trump regime for insidiously using the assassination of Charlie Kirk as an excuse to abolish the First Amendment, round up Americans, and carry out the Nazification of America."

"Got me defending Jimmy Kimmel and agreeing with Tucker Carlson, I hate it here," one user wrote.

And finally, one tweet read, "When Tucker fucking Carlson is 'the voice of reason' you KNOW shit is fucked up."
