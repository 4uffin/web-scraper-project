1. Dr Teal's "Hawaiian Bliss" Epsom salt magnesium soak, a ~limited edition~ blend of red sea salt, papaya, and hibiscus, reviewers are so in love with that a ton of them are buying extra bags (or literally hoarding them) before the brand runs out. One reviewer went so far as to call it "heaven in a bag!" www.amazon.com, AmazonRead more about how an epsom salt soak or bath can help with stress and muscle relaxation at Cleveland Clinic.Promising review: "I bought this product hoping for a fresh, divine scent, and wow, it completely blew me away! I’m usually not one to purchase scented products without smelling them first, but I took a leap of faith and it paid off. Hawaiian Bliss is everything I hoped for and more. The scent is absolutely heavenly; rejuvenating, relaxing, and somehow energizing at the same time. After using it, I feel calmer, refreshed, and even a little happier. I genuinely look forward to using it. I’m already planning to order more, not just for myself but to include in gift baskets for friends and family. If you’re on the fence, go for it. Highly recommend!" —K. MarieGet it from Amazon for $5.87.
2. A newly updated Prepara Salad Pod that will make you the CHAMPION of the work lunch circuit. This has all the meal prep convenience of putting a salad in a jar, but effortlessly turns into a bowl so you can go to clown town on your veggies and proteins, the way the universe intended. AmazonCheck out a TikTok of the Prepara Salad Pod in action. Promising review: "An awesome invention. I take salads daily to work, and it’s so convenient. Also the dressing at the top makes mixing salad so easy." —Adrienne Williams Get it from Amazon for $25.
3. E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the "Ecstatic" shade, which reviewers say captures the same magic as "Black Honey," the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, nonsticky "go-to" lip to keep in all your favorite bags and haunts this fall. www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comI personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of "universal" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: "I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have several that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn’t get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine." —Hamps5"I searched high and low for this color after I saw it on, guess what ... TikTok! And the creator was right, it’s great for everyone. It’s not too dark or too light. Keeps my lips hydrated with a bit of color and shine. Love it." —Erin C. Get it from Amazon for $8 (also available in eight other shades).
4. A pair of slip-on Hoka lookalikes for anyone whose feet are begging for comfort while their bank account is begging for mercy — these will give you the same cushioned, supportive effect for a FRACTION of the price, and come in adorable colors to boot! www.amazon.com, AmazonPromising review: "Wow! So much better than I even expected. I am a true WIDE in all shoes, boots, and sneakers, so I was pretty skeptical that they’d actually fit, much less be comfortable. But, to my happy surprise, they fit beautifully and are comfy! Mind you, I own and use Hoka sneakers (in “wide”). I’d heard these were like Hoka but more inexpensive: I certainly agree! These may even be better because you can buy 2–3 of these for the price of the Hokas. If you know and love Hoka, like I do, these are a fantastic option!!!" —Lourdes M. MatosGet it from Amazon for $59.99 (available in women's sizes 6–11 and five colors).
5. A ridiiiiiculously popular Yara perfume roller you will love as a warm, soft, floral-leaning vanilla to evoke the coziness and comfort without leaning too musky.  It's designed so you can either wear it alone or use it to enhance your favorite vanilla, floral, and woodsy scents. www.amazon.comPromising review: "This oil smells AMAZING. I got one as a gift, and once I smelled it, I bought three more myself. It lasts throughout the whole day, and I get lots of compliments on it. I love how compact it is, you can put it in your purse or luggage very easily. It is warm and very vanilla-y. This is definitely a 10/10." —Ari R. Get it from Amazon for $4.35.
6. A NeeDoh SplootSplat, another release from the *elite* Needoh sensory fidget toy line for anyone who wants to add more calm and focus to their day. This goo-filled, delightfully bendy fidget has a satisfying squish with tentacles you can push and pull before going back to its original shape. Reviewers also love that it doesn't have the kind of stickiness that picks up debris and makes it hard to clean. www.instagram.comSchylling is a small business that specializes in modern and retro toys, games, and sets. Promising review: "It feels like a real hand if you interlock your fingers with its tentacles. You can push a tentacle inside of itself for some sensory as well. I’m an avid Needoh collector and enthusiast, and I can confidently say it’s competing in the top two spot." —MatthewGet it from Amazon for $6.99 (colors will vary).
7. Eos' new Crème de Pistachio Shea Better Body Lotion, which reviewers compare to the iconic TikTok-famous Vanilla Cashmere scent, but with nuttier, cozier, richer notes. If you're looking for a fall glow-up to your skincare routine, this absolutely decadent scent will be just the ticket — reviewers love how well it layers, and compare it to the cult-fave pistachio Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 62 body mist! www.amazon.comPromising review: "This smells heavenly!! I wore it today with the Cheirosa 62, and it smells delicious! I already purchased a second bottle for me and one for my daughter because I know it's going viral, and I don't want to run out! It's already hard to find where I am. To me, this is even better than the Vanilla Cashmere, and that's been my absolute favorite so far." —Heather Mg Get it from Amazon for $9.98.
8. Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day "Fall Leaves" Hand Soap, a limited edition scent so iconically autumnal that you'll be a little obsessed with smelling your hands after every wash.

The fragrance is earthy yet inviting, like wrapping your hands in a cozy flannel blanket after raking leaves with the kids. It doesn’t just smell good — it feels good. The soap lathers beautifully, rinses clean, and leaves my hands soft without that dry, tight feeling. It’s not just soap — it’s a seasonal ritual. I’ll be buying this every autumn." —Duke of Westfall St. Get it from Amazon for $4.88 (available in two other scents and different sizes, including the iconic Acorn Spice scent, which comes in a three-pack!).

They fit my face well and stay in place without slipping off. I also noticed my fine lines look a bit smoother after using them consistently. These are definitely a new favorite in my skincare routine, and I highly recommend them for anyone needing an extra boost of hydration and firming!" —Traciam2003Get a pack of four from Amazon for $12.59 (clip the 10% off coupon on the product page for this price).

They're really cute, they smell great, and I end up keeping them everywhere so I can use them throughout the day. It keeps my lips soft and locks in moisture. Especially helpful during winter. I highly recommend." —Lauren W. Get a four-pack from Amazon for $11.96.

Tired of soft pillows that wake you up in sweat? Look no more! I am a very hot-natured, hot-sleeping person. I can not sleep without a fan on high blowing on me.

It’s super cute and does the job perfectly for espresso shots and milk frothing.

Definitely a nice little accessory for any espresso setup!" —KPGet it from Amazon for $9.99.
16. Byoma Hydrating Milky Toner so good that reviewers compare it to the $32 Rhode Glazing Milk —  this will give you that hydrated, oh-so-dewy effect while *also* soothing your skin, reducing redness, and locking in moisture, thanks to its winning combo of polyglutamic acid and cica.

I tend to avoid anything trendy or anything that 'goes viral' due to my stubborn nature, but when searching Amazon for a red reducing toner, this one just kept showing up, so I swallowed my pride. Social media did not betray us on this one, friends. I saw immediate results. My skin looked much calmer right after the first use, and it feels so smooth. The price is amazing, the bottle is fun, it has no scent (not necessarily a positive for me, but I know it's important to others), it feels good to put on, and looks good on the skin. I have a feeling that I will be repurchasing this toner, highly recommend." —Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $14.99.

I feel like I have been missing out because I don’t like to use the hard metal or plastic on my face, especially when I’ve had a long day and don’t want more negative sensory input. This will get me to do some self-care because it is actually pleasant to use. Excited to make this part of my routine before the end of the night." —AlwaysAHuntGet it from Amazon for $12.99.

It didn’t do a thing to my well-exfoliated palm, but my face, legs, LIPS… baby soft with big balls of dead skin coming off. Like one of those Korean exfoliating gloves, but you don’t have to scrub like you do with those. You just gently rub it in, and your dead skin peels away. I even had a weird callus on my arm that kept regrowing, [and] it smoothed it down so cleanly. This stuff is truly magic. Just WOW." —NellieGet it from Amazon for $25.

Every time I think to put it on something new, my brain does a little high-five with my mouth. Promising review: "This is elite salt. Fancy without being pretentious. The flakes are perfect for finishing, adding that satisfying little crunch and flavor pop to everything from steaks to chocolate chip cookies and buttered sourdough toast. Yes, toast. Trust me. The tub is massive and resealable, which keeps it fresh and easy to use. If you’re into flavor, this is the salt upgrade your pantry didn’t know it needed." —Alyn ReadsGet it from Amazon for $13.96.

After about three weeks, those stubborn dark spots are visibly lighter, and my overall skin tone is brighter and more even. My texture feels smoother, and my skin is happily hydrated. The 5% tranexamic acid really seems to make a difference for fading spots, and it's been gentle on my sensitive skin. If you want a serum that brightens, evens tone, and tackles blemishes without feeling heavy, this is it. It's a new favorite!" —Amazon CustomerGet it from Amazon for $18.90.

The charge on these goes for at least four hours (I haven't tried it beyond that yet), and the Bluetooth connects to my devices super easily.
