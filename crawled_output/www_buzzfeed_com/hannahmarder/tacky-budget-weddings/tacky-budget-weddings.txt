1.
Why on Earth would it even occur to you to use diapers on wedding crafts?

2.
Go ahead and use DIY centerpieces, but just because fish are cheap doesn't make them decor.

3.
I'm not gonna shame this DIY decor, but I AM going to shame trying to get people to PAY to clean it up under the guise of selling it online.

4.
I'll keep my thoughts on the look of this DIY decor to myself, but you gotta admit, trying to sell cheap, used decor — especially for this price — screams tacky. (Also, a fire wedding for a volunteer firefighter? Really?)
u/sammybr00ke / Via reddit.com
5.
Using others' expensive decor is NOT a way to save money. Or I guess it is, but it's certainly not an acceptable way.

6.
Still confused? Paying an agreed-upon $200 for a beginner baker to make you a cake: ✅ Eating 80% and then trying to demand a partial refund because it's "aesthetically disappointing" (when you knew it was a beginner baker and also she did a great job!): Tacky!!!!!

This is why you don't skimp on catering, folks.
u/public-buttcrack / Via reddit.com
8.
And this is why you don't try to bring your own food.

Need another reason to leave wedding food to the professionals?
u/PunnyPopcorn23 / Via reddit.com
10.
If you are gonna make your own food, stick with the classics. And maybe stay away from kids' items like Spaghetti-Os.

11.
Say it louder so the people in the back can hear: don't skimp on food!!!!
u/kirannui / Via reddit.com
12.
Pro tip: Spray painting the grass is not a budget-friendly way to brighten up your venue.
u/SnuzieQ / Via reddit.com
13.
And using mashed potato mix instead of rice is nottttt the budget-friendly hack you think it is.
u/fuckmakinausername / Via reddit.com
14.
Instead of serving steak, maybe this couple should've focused on serving enough to eat.
u/roomomma1126 / Via reddit.com
15.
If you can't even suggest accommodation for your guests besides "sleep outside," maybe have a private wedding for just your immediate family.

16.
I'm all for DIY crafts, but toilet paper rolls? That aren't even covered with anything (except duct tape)?
u/Maloolooloo / Via reddit.com
17.
I hate to shame more DIY, which can be cute, but...this couple should've scrolled Pinterest a little longer.
u/myfriendscode / Via reddit.com
18.
This plan for bathrooms at a wedding strayed from "money-saving" to "genuinely disgusting" territory.
u/morning1022 / Via reddit.com
19.
This "bathroom" wasn't much better.
u/ajlk24 / Via reddit.com
20.
This should go without saying, but please don't make your guests pay for their own food.
[deleted] / Via reddit.com
21.
Maybe this is controversial, but imo, if you can afford a reception, you need to feed people a full meal.
u/Strange-Spite-1234 / Via reddit.com
22.
And cake doesn't count!
u/nodramamama82 / Via reddit.com
23.
The idea behind this was nice, but, uh, I gotta say these handmade decorations ended up a lil' tacky.
u/camlaw63 / Via reddit.com
24.
It's okay if you can't afford elaborate displays, but this decor was pretty crappy (see what I did there?).
u/Ortant / Via reddit.com
25.
This might be a money-saving hack that works, but it's certainly not one that's appropriate by moral standards.
u/KissMySass99 / Via reddit.com
26.
This one mystifies me. You're rich enough to serve tuna tartare, yet you're serving it in a PVC pipe??
u/MMQ42 / Via reddit.com
27.
I know that wedding food is expensive, but that's no excuse to leave those with dietary restrictions with pieces of cardboard to eat.
u/ReeseBalt / Via reddit.com
28.
Vegans are people, too!
u/Akira_Reviews / Via reddit.com
29.
Wedding meals don't need to be fancy, but this looks like baby food, and it's not enough for dinner.
u/laserdiscos / Via reddit.com
30.
If you're going to expect your wedding party to help set up the wedding in order to save money, fair enough. But at least feed them more than one tiny slice of pizza for a day and a half of work!
u/MermaidSplashes / Via reddit.com
31.
By all means, make things yourself, but at least get the spelling right. Better yet? Print a sign from online, and use spellcheck.
u/twist-top-gatorade / Via reddit.com
32.
I'm not sure it gets much tackier than forcing guests to come after the ceremony, dinner, AND live music because you didn't like the amount of money they gave you.
u/av607 / Via reddit.com
33.
This is worse than not having one. If I see a cake, I'm thinking I'm going to be able to eat cake. Don't mess with my emotions like this.
u/slick_steph / Via reddit.com
34.
Go ahead and forgo the cake if you need to, but seeing these donuts displayed on unfinished wood is already making my mouth taste like sawdust.
u/BurgerWrangler / Via reddit.com
35.
How much do you want to bet these had paint chips on them?
u/LittleAmbitions / Via reddit.com
36.
This couple decided to save money by having a small reception at a restaurant — great! Except they expected guests to pay more than they normally would at that restaurant for their food – not so great!
u/Lynncy1 / Via reddit.com
37.
Trying to actually PROFIT off wedding guests goes beyond cheap and tacky. I would 100% be skipping this wedding — even if it was my brother's.
u/FormalityBites / Via reddit.com
38.
It takes a special type of entitlement to try to make money off your guests.
u/itsbeenalongtimelurk / Via reddit.com
39.
I can't believe I need to repeat this — weddings should not be paid for by your guests!
u/muddling_wp / Via reddit.com
40.
Choose an unconventional venue if you like. But I'm sorry, I cannot get behind getting married in a GAS STATION.
u/ds3101 / Via reddit.com
41.
And finally, this isn't the bride or groom's fault, but I have to show this wildly cheap and tacky sign that this poor couple ended up with.
