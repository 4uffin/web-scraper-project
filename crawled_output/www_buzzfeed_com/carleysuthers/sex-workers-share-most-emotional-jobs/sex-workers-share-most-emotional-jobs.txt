Sex workers interact with nearly every kind of client and emotion imaginable, especially considering many people find it easier to open up to someone they don't interact with on a regular basis. Oftentimes, these emotional confessions leave a lifelong impact on a person...

"When I was 20, I was in a tough situation and needed money to survive. I only ever went on dates with sugar daddies, but… I branched out three times, and this client was my last. He had a terminal illness that he wasn’t getting treatment for, but he looked completely fine. Handsome, nice body, cute hair, and glasses. He just looked like a normal guy, not what you’d imagine when you hear the word 'terminal.'"

"He was 21, just a year older than me, and over the app, he asked me for a normal date night that ended with gentle and loving sex like a real couple would have. He had never dated; he was always focused on school and sports, and he thought it’d pay off to wait, but it didn’t.I accepted, and I came over in pajamas. We cuddled and watched one of the Resident Evil movies while we ate takeout. He told me a lot (that’s how I know all this), and I told him some things too. We kissed and did the deed. I slept next to him that night. I know I shouldn’t have stayed over, but it felt right. It was more personal than any dates I had ever gone on, and he treated me better than any man I had met up to that point. I sort of fell in love with him that night. After I kissed him goodbye the next morning, I just sat in my car and cried. I wouldn’t have even charged him if he hadn’t insisted.I definitely value my own life more now after being intimate with someone whose life was actively fleeting. I debated trying to find him on social media to see if maybe he decided to get treatment and live, or drive by that apartment and, by some chance, see if he still lives there, but it’s been years, and I think I’d be crushed if I found out he died. I’d rather not know. I’ve got a boyfriend and my life is good now, thankfully, but I do think of him sometimes and the life I hope he's living. He was a very nice guy."—u/stwabewwie

"I had a client reach out. He was very upfront about his condition. He and one of his home care nurses would set up a time for a companion to come visit."
"He was in his late 30s but was born with significant physical issues; he was a quadriplegic with a trach. He could communicate verbally a bit, but had a perfect intellect. I saw him a few times, but I later moved away. I remember he emailed me saying how thankful he was that I touched him like a human being, not just a lump of flesh. Everyone treats him like a child because of his need for total care. He can't do anything for himself; he's basically a prisoner in his broken body. If not for the nurse and the sex workers that see him, he'd never have any sexual outlet."—u/smokeandshadows

"A friend and neighbor of mine (she’s a sex worker) said the toughest client she had was a guy in hospice. He didn't want sex; he just asked her to paint his nails and talk because it reminded him of his daughter."
"She said she held it together while she was there, but bawled the whole drive home."—[deleted]

"I once had a client who wanted me to come over around 4 a.m., which was late, but he offered to pay handsomely. When I got there, we made small talk. It was difficult to get him to talk sexy at all, and he seemed distraught. I was a bit disappointed because he was attractive. Eventually, we started kissing, but he seemed reluctant. After a second, he pulled away and said he couldn't continue."

"Apparently, it was the anniversary of his son's death, and he had hired me to distract him. However, once I got there, he realized that I looked like and reminded him too much of his son, and he couldn't go through with it. He talked to me about him for a while, and at one point, we tried to see if it'd be helpful for him to talk to me like I was his son, but it was too painful for him.I was only there for half an hour. I didn't try to take any money from him since we didn't have sex, but he wouldn't let me leave without paying me the full amount and then some.The poor guy wanted a distraction and got a very visceral reminder instead. I feel bad for him."—u/reign-storm
5.
"A husband and wife booked me for a threesome because having a lesbian experience was on her bucket list. She’d recently recovered from a double-mastectomy and had just been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor, despite undergoing chemotherapy."
"In a private (fully clothed) moment between the husband and me, he told me that she didn't have long left.The way they looked at each other was so beautiful — just pure love."—u/TheSpiritualSlut
6.
"I had a client who told me 10 minutes before the end of a session that he had to report to prison the next day for serious time. I'm not sure exactly what for, but it seemed drug-related. He told me he was having his last hurrah before committing suicide. We talked about it, and I gave him some numbers to call, but to this day, I have no idea if he went through with it or not."
"That session was above my pay grade for sure."—u/Egg_shaped
7.
"I was a sex worker for about a year and a half. I had a regular client in his mid-thirties with a number of mental health diagnoses; however, his family didn’t believe in mental illness. He wouldn’t socialize with anyone except for his family members. A mental breakdown the year prior forced him to quit his job, sell his house, and move back in with his parents. He had never had sex with anyone who wasn’t a sex worker, and he had never been on a date with a woman or had any female friends."

"He would book overnight appointments with me, and we wouldn’t even have sex; he just wanted the company. The $3,500 he paid was for a sleepover with me. All he would ever want to do was talk and cuddle. He once told me I was his best friend, and how sad that was, considering he had to pay me, and if there was no payment, I wouldn’t even be there. It broke my heart. I cared for him very much, and still think of him from time to time."—u/jellyfishbby

"I've worked as a dominatrix and a sex worker. My saddest experience was with one of my submissives. I saw this client a few times. He was very intelligent, funny, and had a successful career. He was heavily into receiving pain, and our sessions were on the more extreme end. Afterwards, he'd always want to cuddle, chat, and laugh."
"One day, after our session, he told me he was finally retiring and going to solo travel and have some experiences. Not long after, someone told me he had passed away. Based on the timeline, I doubt he ended up vacationing.I've had other clients who were depressed, in bad marriages, or unhappy with their lives, but he was the only client that I'd known to have passed away, and under such sad circumstances."—u/timidlioness

"I was a dancer in college for women's and gay clubs. I never did anything private, but would sit with generous customers. Most of the time, I just tuned out whatever they were saying, but there was one older guy who always wanted to talk and said I reminded him of his ex-boyfriend, but he wasn't creepy."
"He brought in a bunch of photos of him with his boyfriend that were around 30 years old, and the guy looked like he could be my brother. The patron had married a woman, had a family, and lived a straight life in public. His wife had left him, and his kids wanted nothing to do with him. All he ever did was talk about his boyfriend, who had died shortly after he was married. He was so full of regret for not spending time with his boyfriend; it was just painful. He never proposed anything else, was always super respectful and generous, I genuinely felt bad for the guy."—[deleted]

"I had a former customer with Parkinson’s disease whom I met at a club. He got Parkinson’s at only 29. As his condition worsened over the years, his wife started sleeping with his best friend at the time, and eventually left him. He paid me a few times to come over and clean his house, watch TV with him, and talk to him because he was so lonely. To be honest, I didn't understand the majority of what he was saying because his speech was affected, but I nodded along so he would feel like someone was listening."

"He wanted me to move in and marry him and take care of him, but it was more than I could handle. I have my own health issues and can barely take care of myself. He eventually moved a couple of hours away to be closer to his parents for help (he didn't have kids), but they are in their 90s and not sure how much longer they can help him before they pass. I recommended he hire a legitimate nurse, but he kept trying to get me and other strippers to move in with him, marry him, and be his caretaker."—u/Prize_Revenue5661

"When I was stripping, I once had a successful lawyer BAWLING in my arms because he'd never had sex or a proper relationship despite wanting both. He had autism and really struggled with physical touch like hugging, hand holding, etc. He felt safe enough with me to open up about his story and also try hugging a bit."
"I felt touched as I could relate. I have severe misophonia, which has really restricted my life in so many ways — including relationships."—u/dodgystyle

"I was just doing cam work. But when you’re a cam girl, people can take you into private mode and get a custom-negotiated 'scene' with just you. One time, I was camming and suddenly my screen went into private mode. I started to take off some of my clothes just out of the assumption that this person would want to see me naked…"
"Well, he told me, 'You don’t need to do that. I just want you to listen to me.' He proceeded to tell me about how he had been going through a divorce and was struggling. He just wanted to read me a short story he wrote. Not only was he actually a fairly normal guy, but he was an amazing author if what he was reading to me was actually his.So I sat there and just listened to him while he enjoyed reading his works aloud."—u/Soft-Ruin-4350
13.
"Not my story, but I had a friend who did 'rent a night' work. Once, she had a guy ask her if she could come over; he didn't talk about sex over the phone; he just told her to come over and come hungry. She thought he was probably into 'feeding.'"

"She arrived at 6 p.m., which was pretty early for her work. She asked what he would like to do, and he just wanted to cook a big, delicious meal for her. He opened up a bit and told her that his wife had passed, and she always loved his cooking, but he hated cooking for himself."—[deleted]
14.
"I had one client whom I felt bad for. Both of his legs and one arm were amputated, and he was older and alone. It didn't seem like he had anyone in his life other than the healthcare professionals who took care of him; he was really sweet and had an older, defeated voice. He couldn’t really do anything on his own."
"I just felt incredibly bad for him and thought about offering him my services for free every once in a while, but never did. He just wanted to be in the presence of someone else and have someone to talk to and feel close to."—u/PancakeGirl3

"On the flip side, I hired a sex worker when I was 19. I had never done the deed with anyone. I had a single dating partner who wasn't online, and it only lasted three months. I was quite lonely and desperate for something."

"I met with this woman, and she noticed how nervous I was. She suggested we sit and talk for a bit, maybe watch something together to calm me down. I remember we watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail with my head in her lap for most of it. As I talked, I let a bit more slip than I wanted and started getting emotional. I talked about my loneliness, desperation, and abusive parents, all of that. We didn't end up doing the deed. There was some lewd touching, but in the end, we fell asleep holding each other.After I woke up, I tried to pay her for wasting her night and apologized profusely. She rejected the money, told me to go get a nice breakfast to start my day, and go buy a cute dress I had seen in a store that I wanted. We kept in touch until I started dating someone."—u/Lil_Gigi

"Not me, but my ex-boyfriend was a sex worker for the first half of our relationship."
"Aside from his relationship with me, the last client he saw was one of the tipping points that made him quit. He was back home visiting his family and decided to respond to someone's post. When he showed up, it was his grade school music teacher. My ex was quite the piano prodigy, so he said that when he walked in, his teacher's face was pure sadness, as my ex was one of his favorite students.They ended up not doing anything sexual, and the two of them had a lovely conversation catching up on where their lives had taken them (at this point, my ex was a senior in college).After they finished talking, the man had my ex play the piano for him in his home. He said that after that moment, he just couldn't handle sex work anymore."—u/acboyz2

"I don't know if phone sex operators count, but here it is: I had a man call me, who kept pinging my line for three hours — even my manager had to tap in to make sure I wasn't being lured or groomed and that the call was 'genuine.'"

"At first, it was just a normal chat, about his wife, but more about his daughter. I was going to give it 10 minutes in, and if it got creepy, I would hang up and block him. Turns out, he just wanted someone to hear how proud he was of his daughter, how much he missed her at Christmas, and that she was away for school and couldn't come home. That's when he began to cry. The next 20 minutes were him just sobbing, but before we got cut off, he told me he would call me again because he had more to say.In truth, his daughter was hit by a drunk driver the previous winter, and his marriage was ending because of the different choices he and his wife had made; he was still grieving, and she was moving on. He wanted to call someone and just talk about his daughter as if she were alive. He assured me he knew she was dead and that he had a therapist, but couldn't bring himself to say he imagines her presence and hears her voice. We talked about the things he wished for her, and all the things he wanted to experience, like grandkids, Disneyland, etc. I was completely and emotionally drained. When it was over, my supervisor sent me home. I couldn't cry, I tried, but nothing happened. I just kept it to myself. The experience made me a better person overall."—u/snaffsnaffsnaff
