"He was your typical wild high schooler, always wearing the same black trench coat with a tough exterior, but he was a sweetheart once you got to know him. He grew up in extreme poverty and lived in a tiny studio that his mother paid $70 a month for until he graduated. Despite everything, he was incredibly intelligent, hilarious, and earned excellent grades. He got me and others through some tough times during and after high school. Eventually, he got a job at a pizza place near our high school. Looking back, our friend group said that taking that job led to the one bad decision that cost him his life..."

"On his way to work, he accepted a ride from a friend who was drunk. He didn't buckle his seatbelt because the drive was going to be short. At an intersection, their car collided with another vehicle. My friend was ejected, and his injuries were so severe that, at his open-casket wake, his face was mostly reconstructed with wax.The loss shattered all of us who loved him, especially his ex-girlfriend. He was the kind of person we believed would go on to change the world with his intelligence. The world never got to see that, but I’m grateful to have called him a close friend. We still miss and love him. Growing up has been hard without him, and I think he would be so surprised at how all our lives turned out."—Anonymous, 35, Los Angeles

"Our valedictorian got involved with a conservative church and dropped out of college her first semester to get married, start a family, and live a trad-wife lifestyle."
"My mom ran into her at a charity event about 15 or 16 years after we graduated, and she had six kids and was homeschooling them all the way through high school. She was estranged from her family, and my mom thought she seemed very sad. No one saw that coming. She had been a math and science wiz."—lovelyshield875

"My friend went to high school with a really smart kid whom she would speak to, but they weren't necessarily friends. This guy graduated high school early and got his master's in math before he was 19. Within a year or two, he was ‘off the grid’ because he started hacking crypto and was on the run."
"Turns out he had stolen $45 million in cryptocurrency and was wanted by the US and Canadian authorities.He’s been arrested now, but it's sad because he was so smart and had a bright future ahead of him."—Anonymous, 24, Hamilton, Ontario

"In high school, my friend’s older brother was the 'golden boy.' He was the kid who crushed every sport, aced every test, and made it all look effortless. While most of us were figuring out prom dates and SAT scores, he had already secured a spot in a prestigious seven-year medical program straight out of high school. Everyone thought he was destined to become the doctor parents bragged about at dinner parties."

"Years later, rumors floated around that he’d dropped out, but nobody knew for sure. Fast forward, I was in Seattle visiting friends and casually asked, 'Hey, didn't he move out here?' My friends looked stunned because they still thought he was in med school.After a few days of texting, he finally agreed to meet us, and that’s when the story flipped: He walked up to our car carrying a massive 20-pound bag of weed, and with a straight face, told us, 'This is my entire life’s savings.'Apparently, he’d left everything behind to live on a remote island. His home was an abandoned bus, and he bartered to survive. He doesn’t believe in cash anymore; he just trades odd jobs for food and uses weed as his currency.I sat there stunned. He was once the smartest, most promising kid in school, the guy everyone believed was going to save lives in a hospital someday. Instead, he was living completely off the grid, using a bag of weed as his bank account.It was surreal. A reminder that no matter how certain someone’s future looks in high school, life can take the most unexpected turns."—Anonymous, 33, Long Island, New York

"They were the class president, valedictorian, always on the honor roll, accepted to a big-name college in his junior year, etc. Became a politician in town, then got a DWI after they crashed a car into a house and fled the scene. Cocaine was also found."
"They were tracked down and arrested not long after hiding in the woods. I haven’t seen or heard of them since, so I'm not sure what they're doing these days."—Anonymous

"I was considered the smart kid in school. I was hated by both students and teacher. Back then they graded on a curve, but I maxed out on all of the tests, so they couldn't use the curve, which made a lot of people angry. They wouldn't let me graduate with the class so that the most popular girl could graduate first grade point-wise."
"Anyway, I moved to Texas and started my company on oil wells pressure testing. At 36, I sold my company financially wealthy. Really wealthy.At our 40th class reunion, they all wanted me to finance a new gym with a basketball court for the school, saying, 'It's for a good cause.' I told them, 'No', and walked out. They still hate me, so I guess things never change."—Joey, Yahoo

"In fifth grade, I was shunted into the gifted program, which was a bit of a misnomer because I don't think I’m particularly gifted, nor were most of my peers in the class. But in that class of 25, there was one guy named Gavin."
Universal Pictures / Via youtube.com
"Gavin was a genius. I can't explain it any other way. His real genius was math, which he understood intuitively, but he just understood everything. He absorbed information, understood it, and could analyze it. He was superhuman.I was one of the best in the class in math, so we were often paired on projects, but even with my limited skills, he was MILES above me, as if I were a toddler. Until you meet someone like this, you can’t really understand what genius is.Anyways, he did a combined undergrad in math and physics and got the highest mark that the university has ever given out, received a fully paid (literally made a profit from all of his scholarships) ride to do a doctoral program in physics at one of the best universities in the world, and coasted through it.He got a tenure-track position at a top university, published three ground-breaking articles in his first 18 months, and then got brain cancer and died in four months.It still pisses me off, years later. Oh, and he was also a super nice guy."—u/SixButterflies

"A childhood friend of mine was a year younger, but in my grade because he skipped third grade. He was always the smartest kid in the room."
"He went to an elite private high school, got a perfect 1600 on the SATs, did his undergrad at Harvard, a PhD at Stanford, and is currently revolutionizing an important field of science as a full professor at a world-class research university.Nice guy, too."—u/FunkyChromeMedina

"He was super smart. He skipped a grade and went to Purdue on a full scholarship at 17. He lived in the dorms and got addicted to porn. He failed junior year, moved back home, and had to go to a Christian porn rehab. He now works as a pastor. His mom told my mom that he can't go anywhere near a computer and has to use a flip phone to avoid temptation."

"During seventh grade, a boy transferred to my school. He was very quiet and always seemed to be staring off into space. One day, my friends dared me to sit with him during lunch. I took the dare, but once I began talking to him, I realized how kind he was. I began talking to him more, and that grew his confidence to contribute in class. I remember the first time he raised his hand and told the teacher that he already knew the criteria; all of the students went silent. The teacher made him do all the math, and he got every single problem right. At the end of the day, he was in 12th-grade math."
NBC / Via giphy.com
"We were friends until junior year, when he came back from summer break different. He began hanging out with the popular kids, smoking, and joking around. The thing that amazed me was that he still had record grades and was in college-level math. In his senior year, he was voted prom king and 'most popular' in the yearbook. He got offers from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, and Cornell. Fast-forward, I’m now retired with grandchildren. One day, I walked into the local grocery store, and who did I see working as a cashier? The same guy. Turns out, he went to Yale, but dropped out after failing all his classes because he was lazy!"—Anonymous, 68, Chicago

"I was always at the top of my class, usually in the top five. Student body president, athlete, involved in pretty much every club. Graduated, got a full ride to college, joined a fraternity, and then got hooked on cocaine. Ended up dropping out and spent some time unhoused."
"I got sober five years ago. Today I’m a realtor with a family, and life is good. It’s not the picture I imagined when I was younger, but I’m actually glad for that. Back then, I was arrogant and thought I had it all figured out. Turns out the hard detour made me better."—Anonymous, 32, Albuquerque
12.
"Our smart kid was a little weird, but he wasn't bullied or anything. One day, he drove to a nearby police station and stopped by officers who were assigned to guard the facility, and then began making statements to one of the officers who detained him that he intended to shoot."
"He didn't elaborate whether he intended to shoot the station or the officers, but he did say he intended to shoot, which led the officers to take him into custody for a mental health evaluation. He also admitted to having weapons in the vehicle, and officers discovered two 9mm handguns along with a Guy Fawkes mask."—Anonymous, 29, Dallas, Texas

"He was valedictorian. We both had crushes on each other, but my grades were less-than-average due to a very troublesome home life. I had no support and was raising myself. He told me I was a distraction and insinuated that I was too dumb for him. After we graduated, he got into MSU with a goal to become a doctor. I started college and was majoring in zoology, but had to quit to take care of my dying mom. I ended up working at a call center and just trying to survive. He eventually reached out to me, led me on, and ghosted me."

"Thirteen years later, I’m a veterinary technician and married to my other high school crush. We have a son together and are so happy. He, on the other hand, never became a doctor, recently had a mental breakdown, and has no one in his life.Don’t ever let anyone tell you you’re not good enough."—Anonymous, 33, Michigan

"I went to school with a clarinet protégé. She was incredibly smart in every class as well, and I knew one day she’d be a famous musician or physicist. She went to the university 40 minutes from our hometown instead of being recruited for Cal Tech or Stanford."
"I lost touch with her because she didn’t use social media, but about five years ago, I took a second job working at a hotel front desk in the evenings. My second week there, she was on the midnight shift and came to relieve me. I found out she was married, and that she teaches English and Latin full-time online and works as a night auditor at our hometown hotel. I don’t believe her mom ever pressured her (she also worked at the hotel), but I do think her mom did a lot of things for her, and it's been difficult for her to adapt to an independent adult life."—Anonymous, 33, St. Louis, Missouri
15.
"The smartest kid in my class went to law school and passed the bar. She ended up getting married and being a stay-at-home mom until her kids were out of high school."
"Now, she does freelance legal work part-time, mostly preparing legal documents or counseling. She seems like she is very happy and has led a fulfilling life."—James, Yahoo

"This was in the '90s: He had an effortless ability in creative studies. He required no prep for literature and language, and was already a professional-level comic book artist; we saw his drawings daily. At college, the same happened — absolutely effortless, A-grade work for little to no effort. We all had to work very hard for it, except him."

"Fast-forward to today, and it's like the teenage highs never left him. He's arrogant and lazy; he's still incredibly talented, but barely scrapes by, living off his parents in an apartment they pay for and a life they subsidize. At 45, he is still waiting for a big break to happen to him, instead of just working hard. The opportunities are there and fall into his lap, but he never capitalizes on them. Biggest waste of talent. And of course, he spends most of his days streaming and posting on the internet to argue with strangers about politics, art, or generally how his moral compass is better than anyone else’s."—Anonymous, 44, London

"My mom was voted 'smartest' and 'most likely to succeed.' And she did! She had a 34-year career in elementary education and retired a millionaire because of her smart investment choices. She's still the smartest woman I've ever met and incredibly kind and caring about the planet and every living thing."
"I'm so proud and honored to be her daughter. The world would be so much better if people followed her lead. She gives much of her money away to those less fortunate. She’s still very involved in the community and volunteers almost every day for different organizations. She’s 85, but most people guess she's in her 60s. Her kindness has kept her young. I love her."—annaetienne

"That kid was me! Everything came easy in the beginning. I was reading far above my grade level, doing above-grade-level math. I was the quintessential 'Smart Kid.' Then, somewhere in mid-middle school, I hit the ceiling of my above-average intelligence. Once I got to where I had to actually 'learn' something, I was in trouble."
"I began to struggle in math, or with anything that I had to memorize. I knew plenty of history, literature, and the parts of a human cell, but algebra might as well have been a foreign language (which I also struggled with), and I couldn't memorize the periodic table to save myself. I had no idea how to study or learn new things that I couldn't just read about in a textbook. I had such a hard time doing it. I didn't enjoy school anymore and barely graduated high school, when I could still regurgitate facts from a textbook or news stories better than most people.I got accepted to college due to my ACT scores alone, but because I already had a baby, I had to go to work. Thirty years of physical labor jobs later, and I am finally working at a job where I get to use my brain. I look back at my elementary school education, and I can remember years of teachers letting me go to the school library and get books to just come back to the class and read quietly. I believe this was them thinking they were helping me, but really, it was ignoring me in order to help the kids who were struggling. This was in a lower-class part of SLC, so there were a lot of struggling students. I don't ever remember getting academically challenged during my early years. I wish there had been a teacher or two who wanted to give me more attention."—Anonymous, 54, Utah

Finally, "The smartest kid I ever knew was a guy named 'Nicky.' We met in the third grade, and after that meeting, I decided I didn't like him because he was weird, so I ignored him."

"The next year, we wound up not only being in the same class again, but also enrolled in our school's 'accelerated learning' program, which made it impossible for me to avoid him. By the time school let out that summer, we had become the best of friends, and throughout the rest of grade school, we were almost always assigned to the same classes - courtesy of our school counselor.At the end of our senior year, Nicky was named valedictorian, which meant that he had to give a speech at the commencement ceremony. An introverted numbers wizard (who had earned his A.S. in Mathematics by sophomore year), he was so mortified about giving a speech and asked me to help him write it, which, of course, I did. I was never prouder of him than when he stood up and gave his final farewell to the rest of our Class of '82.Nicky was offered full-rides to a few prestigious universities... and I, being the product of a poor and broken home, decided to join the military. We kept in touch for some time after we graduated, but started to drift apart while I was stationed overseas. At some point, we just stopped talking. I sure wish we hadn't...Nicky committed suicide in 1999; no note was left, and no reason was given. I visited his grave a few years ago, and it was well-kept.And I am so very tired."—Saint Christopher Walken, Yahoo
