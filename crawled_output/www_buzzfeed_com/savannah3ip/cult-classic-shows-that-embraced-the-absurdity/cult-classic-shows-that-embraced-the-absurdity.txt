Horrifying": 15 TV Shows That We All Loved Back In The Day, But Are Actually Low-Key Disasters"Riverdale is the most insane show, but I couldn’t stop watching it."by Savannah IpBuzzFeed StaffFacebookPinterestLink
Some TV shows are so bad, they swing right back around to being iconic. The acting? Questionable. The plots? Unhinged. The drama? Off the charts. And yet… we couldn’t stop watching if we tried.

Whether it was small-town chaos that felt like a fever dream, supernatural teen angst with way too much eyeliner, or endless mystery twists that got more confusing by the episode, these shows knew exactly how to keep us glued to the screen (and yelling at it). A recent Reddit thread had fans debating the best of the worst — and the answers prove these cult classics will never die.

"Riverdale is the most insane show, but I couldn’t stop watching it. It’s fashion. It’s camp. It’s drama. It’s bad. It’s good."
—youaresuchajerk"They introduce supernatural elements in a later season, and it just gets more bonkers as it goes." —abnormallyme
The CW

"Z nation: so bad it's awesome"
—Sonzscotlandz"The great thing is that they didn’t try to be anything more than what they were, and they embraced the absurdity." —ewynn2019

“My favourite bad TV show is CSI: Miami. The acting is terrible, the plot of each episode is so obvious, and the crown jewel is David Caruso. Between the quippy lines, the sideways stance with his hands on his hips, and the removal of his Ray-Bans every 10 minutes, it’s absolutely amazing.”

"Invasion. A beautiful Apple TV+ show with all the annoying characters you could ever imagine! They do things that drive you nuts on a per-episode basis and make you dread their next appearance. Normally, I want humanity to win and overcome the alien threat. In this case, I’m watching just to see my most disliked characters get dispatched in some sort of epic fashion."

“Pretty Little Liars. As a teen, I ate that up. Rewatching it as an adult? Horrifying… but still entertaining.”

The CW

“Baywatch is the GOAT of these.”

"Saved by the Bell falls into this category. Growing up, no one took it seriously — we just watched to see how bad it was. Now, for some reason, people act like it’s a classic?"
–WaterlooMall

"The Secret Life of the American Teenager. Terrible acting, writing, storylines, and characters — but I still watched it all."
—Fridas-Uni33
The CW

"Snowpiercer. My partner somehow got into it and I couldn't turn away."
—SquirrelEnthusiast"I just caved and started the fourth season 30 minutes ago after hearing it’s quite bad. Needed some nonsense to fill the gap until White Lotus finale." —BusinessPurge

“Gotham. The show got better and better each season as it embraced the goofiness of the whole premise. Genuine fun the whole way through, with great performances from Batman’s rogues’ gallery.”
—VinylentBehavior
Fox

“The Ark in that category. So insanely dumb, and yet somehow hard to stop watching. I was cheering for the actors — half of whom had clearly never even been in a school play before — doing their damnedest to bring the loopy script to life.”
—crackanape

“Stiles was the only reason to watch Teen Wolf.”

“Right now, Doctor Odyssey — but you have to buy into the fact that it’s blatantly and happily brain-fluff TV to enjoy it, even if you want to believe the theories about what’s really going on. Also, you’ve got to be down with the fact that, above all else, it’s one of the horniest shows on TV.”

"Salvation. It gets wilder and more insane with each episode. It’s my favourite bad TV show of all time. I don’t want to give too much away, but it has death cults, an Elon Musk–type character becoming president (this was before he came out as a Nazi), the dumbest characters ever, and some of the thickest plot armor you’ll ever see. I cannot recommend it enough.”

“These kids don’t remember the ’80s. Cop Rock is the answer you’re looking for.”
–Gaius_Octavius_“There’s a song about how ugly a senator is, and a song about dealing in stolen babies. And it’s all played seriously.” —ilazul
