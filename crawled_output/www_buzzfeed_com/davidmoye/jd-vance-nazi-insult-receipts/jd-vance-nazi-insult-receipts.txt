JD Vance’s past came to haunt him on Wednesday after he demanded Americans stop using the word “Nazi” as an insult.

During a rally in Concord, North Carolina, the vice president claimed that the shooting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas earlier in the day was “politically motivated” and that Democratic rhetoric encourages violence against law enforcement.However, authorities said the suspect didn’t shoot ICE agents; he killed an immigrant detainee and wounded two others before taking his own life.Vance had a suggestion for how such tragedies could be prevented.

Unfortunately for Vance, his suggestion set him up for mockery in a way he apparently did not see coming.

During Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Vance told a former roommate from Yale Law School that Trump could become “America’s Hitler.”

Since then, Vance has either changed his mind about Trump or decided it was worth setting aside his misgivings in exchange for political power.
Still, many people on social media felt obliged to remind Vance of that one time he called his current boss a Nazi:the only major politicians who’ve called trump hitler: j.d. vance and rfk jr. https://t.co/i4QiLOOcR7— Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) September 24, 2025

Vance added, "If you want to stop political violence, do what the president does and tell your supporters that people who disagree with you are radical left lunatics." https://t.co/aTvVwyg978— Michael A. Cohen (NOT TRUMP’S FORMER FIXER) (@speechboy71) September 24, 2025

There's a simpler way: When you don't want to be called a Nazi, you have to stop acting like one.By the way, a little reminder: it was that JD Vance himself who was one of the first to compare Trump to Hitler in 2016. pic.twitter.com/xlAPDnI2e0— Joshua M2 🇺🇦 (@JoshuaM21241434) September 24, 2025
