If you didn't know, there's a strategy to discourage people from resting or sleeping in public spaces that's called hostile architecture, otherwise known largely online as "anti-homeless architecture." The designs use slopes, spikes, and other methods to make it really, really uncomfortable.

Recently, an example of "anti-homeless architecture" went viral on the /mildlyinfuriating subreddit, and it's seriously pissing people off. Behold:

"This anti-homeless design also makes it hard to sit on," the original poster said when sharing an image of a sloping bench at their local train stop. "It's slippery too. "

Tens of thousands of people reacted to the image, and none were happy. Most called the design overwhelmingly useless.
"This isn’t even an intelligently designed piece of hostile architecture," Reddit user MarsupialNo1220 said.
"Benches conceptually exist as a means to allow people to rest and improve their comfort levels," user tolacid added. "This is no longer a bench."

Not only does the design punish human beings for not having a home, but netizens also commented on how the design harms people with disabilities as well.
"I'm pretty sure that disabled people, pregnant women, elderly people, etc., will also have to use that chair, and it won't be easy for them," Boring-Rub-3570 said.
"I have medical issues that make me unable to do things, [and] this would be hell for me," Acheloma shared. "I get super dizzy and weak sometimes, and this bench would dump me onto the ground if I tried to make it to it to sit down before falling."
"It could legitimately seriously injure someone," they continued. "If you're weak and slide wrong, you could easily hit your head on the armrest or back while falling."

Honestly, Redditors say it's an inconvenience for everyone — all to prevent people without homes from getting needed sleep.
"I've had to wait 30 minutes for a train before, and being able to sit and work or read is important... [It's] hostile to everybody, homeless or not," Accurate_Koala_4698 said.
