Getting older sometimes means we no longer like doing things we did when we were younger, which is totally okay! So when we asked the BuzzFeed Community: "What are you simply getting too old for?" over 200 people shared their experiences. Here are some of the best ones below:
1.
"I’m tired of always going above and beyond for no recognition. I now don’t work unless I get paid. I don’t deal with bullshit and spare others' feelings. I’m fine with being the 'cranky bitch' in my department and fighting back against people throwing their work on me. I’m 46 years old and JUST received my first promotion ever — I was always hired to fix other people’s mistakes. I’m a fixer, I fix things and people, and I’m done."

"A wise friend once told me that once you become an adult, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. For me, that means I don’t go camping. I don’t like it or enjoy it, and I don’t ever have to do it — so I don’t. I’m too old to be sleeping on the ground or cooking food over a campfire."

"I refuse to go to a place that doesn’t have a parking lot. I am too old (and disabled). I am 45."

"NOISE. Quiet the F down, people. Stop using speakers and FaceTime without earbuds. Nobody wants to hear you or your music, and it's frankly aggressive to act this way. And restaurants: turn the music down. We want to talk."

"I’m middle-aged, and I don’t want to spend money and go find parking just to hang with a friend. Please just come over and wear comfy clothes. Let’s eat edibles, make weird concoctions to eat, watch movies, and just vibe and talk about everything in the universe. I’m done with bars, clubs, and concerts. Any time I have to be around a ton of people, I have to decompress for a week after. I’m done with traffic. Moving out of a big city to a small town was the best decision I’ve made. Everything I need is on my street. People are friendly and look out for one another. It’s quiet — and I see all the stars!"

"Just get me to a human to speak with instead of the bot rigmarole! I don't wanna do a million different chats from a robot that won't fix my specific problem or issue — just get me a human person, and we can fix this in five minutes instead of this roundabout nonsense that takes 20 minutes to figure out before you get a 'somewhat human on the chat.' It's chaotic!"

"I noticed that I am eating in restaurants far less frequently than I used to. I'm a pretty good cook, but really, it's just food, and it's way more expensive than what I can make at home. I'm tired of paying 300% markup for wine, too. I live in New York, but even here, there is very little new that is worth the effort."

"Daylight savings time really does hit harder once you start working office jobs or 9-5 type jobs. I worked without a window view. I’d see daylight when I went to the restroom, and that was it; it’s so depressing. Everyone should have access to natural light. It’s so unhealthy to never see the sun. Winter was just painful."

"Caring about underwear lines. Thongs are uncomfortable, and why should I care if somebody else knows that I wear undies?"

"I’m 41 and refuse to multitask anymore. When I was younger, I would pay bills online, text, eat lunch, and work all at the same time. Not anymore. I focus on one thing at a time."

11.
"Subscription as a service. Let me pay for the software ONCE and let me own it. $70/year for antivirus? Go F yourself."

"Rudeness. Common courtesy seems to be a thing of the past, and it seems basic manners are just not being taught to some (not all) kids. Those kids grow up to be entitled, insufferable adults. I honestly believe that etiquette class should be a requirement in elementary school —unfortunately, that’s what it’s come to."

"Now that I’m older, I can’t stand the smell of marijuana. That’s all that goes on in my neighborhood anymore, now that my state gave the okay for medical marijuana. Ugh. I’m just so over the stench. If you had told 20-something me I’d be like this in the future, 20-something me would’ve not believed a word of it."

"When I was younger, I would go places and do things with my friends that I really didn’t want to do (i.e., go to a concert, even though I didn’t care for the band, go white water rafting, even though I’m scared to death of the water), but I did them for the acceptance of my friends. Today, nah, I’m good. We don’t have to share every experience or like all the same things in order to be friends — and if that means that I have fewer friends, so be it."

"I love movies, but I’ve grown to hate movie theaters. I’d have to subscribe to numerous streaming services to see all the new movies I want to see, then be stuck with expensive streaming bills. So, I make do with the one streaming service and watch a lot of old movies."

"I will no longer own a car without air conditioning. I did that all through my 20s. I'm in Florida; that is a hard pass now."

And finally, "I’m so sick of cellphones! I appreciate the vast amounts of ease they offer humans, but to be tethered to your phone, to stop interacting in three dimension with the people and things all around you, to constantly need to take photos of every blasted thing you encounter, and to lose your ability to function if you lose your phone, I can’t even put into words how sad that is."
