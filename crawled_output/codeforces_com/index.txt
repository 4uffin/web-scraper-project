Hello, Codeforces!We are pleased to announce the resumption of the Global Rounds. Thanks to XTX Markets for supporting the initiative! In 2025, we will hold 3 such rounds. The series results will take into account the best 2 participations out of 3.On Sep/20/2025 17:35 (Moscow time) we will host Codeforces Global Round 29 (Div. 1 + Div. 2). Codeforces Global Round 29 marks the first round in the 2025 series of Codeforces Global Rounds. These rounds are open and rated for everyone.The prizes for this round are as follows:
The top 30 participants will receive a t-shirt. 20 t-shirts will be randomly distributed among participants ranked between 31 and 500, inclusive. The prizes for the 3-round series in 2025:
In each round, the top-100 participants get points according to the table. A participant's final score will be the sum of the points they earned in their 2 highest-placing rounds. The top 20 participants across the series will receive sweatshirts and placement certificates. We extend our gratitude to XTX Markets for supporting the global rounds initiative in 2025!The problems were written and prepared by misteg168, FelixMP, Pablo-No, danx, MeGustaElArroz23, Clan328 and me.We would also like to thank:

These are not part of the problem statements, although we tried our best to make sure that their behaviour correctly follows it. You can investigate examples or your own tests in more details with them. Note the following:
the visualizers use javascript in your browser to work; you don't need to install anything additional; we won't be able to help with the visualizers during the round. Picture of authors (and some testers) (and some non testers): We eagerly anticipate your participation!UPD3 Congratulations to all the winners!!!

Hi, Codeforces!Remember this post https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/105779 about highlighting test cases in example inputs?Well, with a quick push, Vladosiya and I have now added support for highlighting cases in the outputs as well. On hover (or tap on mobile), the corresponding input and output cases even get highlighted together. Look at this beauty:
There's still a bit of polishing needed for situations when authors add custom outputs or in some other unusual scenarios, but the basic functionality is already there and ready to use.Enjoy the upcoming rounds!

Hi Codeforces,Have you already spotted it in the schedule? Yes, the next Global Round is coming up on Sep/20/2025 17:35 (Moscow time)!I'm excited to announce a series of three Global Rounds that we'll be holding in 2025. As always, these rounds are kindly supported by XTX Markets. Huge algorithmic thanks to them!Each Global Round will be a common round for both divisions, featuring 7‚Äì9 problems. The contest length will be 2‚Äì3 hours, depending on the number and complexity of the problems. All rounds are rated for everyone. At each round, 50 branded T-shirts will be awarded, and of course, all problem authors will receive T-shirts too.Prizes for this round:
Top 30 participants will get a T-shirt. Another 20 T-shirts will be randomly given out among participants ranked from 31 to 500 (inclusive). Prizes for the 3-round series in 2025:
In each round, the top 100 participants will earn points according to the scoring table. A participant's final score will be the sum of points from their two best rounds. The top 20 overall will receive sweatshirts and certificates. Wishing you a fun and memorable experience in the Global Rounds!

–ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä¬†cry,
2 –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥,
I am extremely delighted to invite you to participate in my first solo round, Codeforces Round 1050 (Div. 4), starting on Sep/13/2025 17:35 (Moscow time). There will be $$$7$$$ problems to be solved in $$$2$$$ hours and $$$15$$$ minutes. The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:
ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission; 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points) after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are an unrated participant/newcomer). We urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism but to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest for the official participants.Only trusted participants of the fourth division will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the fourth division, you must:
take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them), do not have a point of 1400 or higher in the rating. Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the fourth division or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), you may choose to participate rated or unrated.PLEASE NOTE the rule restricting AI use. If you are caught using AI in an unorthodox manner, either by us manually or detected automatically, YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE TERMINATED and your entire family will be sent to my basement (which has no toilets available). We will be actively scouring submissions and terminating rulebreakers.I would like to thank the following individuals for making this contest possible:
Myself for coordinating the round . Vladosiya for russian translations. reirugan for improving the statements. The following testuwuers: Proof_by_QED, reirugan, -firefly-, Filikec, LMeyling, mathtsai, __baozii__, Non-origination, chromate00, SpyrosAliv, Intellegent, Dominater069, Hori, RobinFromTheHood, poi, yse, Vladosiya, Lechaa, hashman, macaquedev, catgirl, kingbass, tin.le2, ByteRaider, litfan, AksLolCoding, expertaq, kwant, xorfftdp, minuki646, Hana05, .Habiba., apollo07, shuniko, Jteh, avighnakc, nifeshe, Edeeva, ChickenTamer, wuhudsm, and temporary1.

Kotlin Heroes 13 Announcement
–ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä¬†BledDest,
12 –¥–Ω–µ–π –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥,
Greetings Codeforces!Ready to put your Kotlin skills to the test? Kotlin Heroes is your playground: a chance to experiment with the language's features, tackle fun and challenging problems, and level up your programming abilities. Perfect for beginners and experts alike!A massive shout-out to all the amazing coders who have competed in past Kotlin Heroes events:
Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3, Episode 4, Episode 5: ICPC Round, Episode 6, Episode 7, Episode 8, Episode 9, Episode 10, Episode 11 and Episode 12.Kotlin Heroes is a great way to play around with Kotlin‚Äôs features, learn something new, and practice using the language by solving fun problems. It is great for programmers of any level! We invite you to join the practice round, where you can improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills and complete training problems. In this round, all the solutions are open, and you can request hints if you‚Äôre stuck.Here are some things you can do to help you refresh your knowledge of Kotlin and learn more about competitive programming while you practice:
Read our competitive programming tutorial. Review our Kotlin solutions for the Advent of Code algorithmic puzzles. Watch the videos from our Kotlin in Competitive Programming YouTube playlist. And if you‚Äôd like to see how the top competitive programmers approach these challenges, check out ecnerwala and SecondThread solving problems from this practice round live on stage at the ICPC World Finals in Baku. Mark your calendars for September 12, 2025! Kotlin Heroes: Episode 13 offers 2 hours and 30 minutes of problem-solving, featuring a wide range of tasks designed for everyone, from those just starting out to experienced competitive programmers.The use of AI-based tools during the main contest is strictly limited. To find out the guidelines for proper AI use, what is allowed and what is prohibited, please read the post "Rule Restricting the use of AI". Improper use of AI tools during the main contest may result in disqualification. Using automatic translation tools (including but not limited to neural networks and AI) to convert code written in other programming languages to Kotlin goes against the spirit of the competition, so it is also strictly prohibited.
