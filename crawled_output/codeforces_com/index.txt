Hello, Codeforces!I am very excited to invite you to our contest Codeforces Round 1054 (Div. 3), which starts on . You will be given 7 problems and 2 hours and 15 minutes to solve them.The problems were authored by me and __rose and soullless to solve and alter them.The round will be hosted by the rules of educational rounds (extended ICPC). Thus, all solutions will be judged on preliminary tests during the round, and after the round, there will be a 12-hour phase of open hacks. After the open hack phase, all accepted solutions will be rejudged on successful hacks. Also, note that there is no score distribution ‚Äî rank will be determined by number of problems solved, followed by penalty; wrong submissions will incur the usual penalty of 10 minutes, following the rules of educational rounds.Remember that only the trusted participants of the third division will be included in the official standings table. As it is written by link, this is a compulsory measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the third division, you must:
take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them) do not have a point of 1900 or higher in the rating. Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the third division or not, if your rating is less than 1600, then the round will be rated for you.We would like to thank:
Vladosiya and soullless for wonderful coordination. Wansur and abc864197532 for red testing. dreamCoderFromKZ, xqqddqqc and Away_in_the_heavens for orange testing. Hagry for purple testing Dif1rent, APMAH, sahaun and thespace for blue testing. ib_, Batyi-A-019-28, HorridBear, Romakolesn and kartikchauhan189 for cyan testing. Erbolat-R-019-28, Umbet and Fadlallah for green testing. MikeMirzayanov and KAN for the great platforms. Vinton Cerf, and Robert Kahn for inventing the internet. Nagi for not giving up football. You for participating!

Hi, Codeforces!Remember this post https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/105779 about highlighting test cases in example inputs?Well, with a quick push, Vladosiya and I have now added support for highlighting cases in the outputs as well. On hover (or tap on mobile), the corresponding input and output cases even get highlighted together. Look at this beauty:
There's still a bit of polishing needed for situations when authors add custom outputs or in some other unusual scenarios, but the basic functionality is already there and ready to use.Enjoy the upcoming rounds!

–ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä¬†cry,
2 –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥,
I am extremely delighted to invite you to participate in my first solo round, Codeforces Round 1050 (Div. 4), starting on Sep/13/2025 17:35 (Moscow time). There will be $$$7$$$ problems to be solved in $$$2$$$ hours and $$$15$$$ minutes. The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds:
ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission; 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points) after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the updated set of tests, and the ratings recalculated by default, only "trusted" participants are shown in the results table (but the rating will be recalculated for all with initial ratings less than 1400 or you are an unrated participant/newcomer). We urge participants whose rating is 1400+ not to register new accounts for the purpose of narcissism but to take part unofficially. Please do not spoil the contest for the official participants.Only trusted participants of the fourth division will be included in the official standings table. This is a forced measure for combating unsporting behavior. To qualify as a trusted participant of the fourth division, you must:
take part in at least five rated rounds (and solve at least one problem in each of them), do not have a point of 1400 or higher in the rating. Regardless of whether you are a trusted participant of the fourth division or not, if your rating is less than 1400 (or you are a newcomer/unrated), you may choose to participate rated or unrated.PLEASE NOTE the rule restricting AI use. If you are caught using AI in an unorthodox manner, either by us manually or detected automatically, YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE TERMINATED and your entire family will be sent to my basement (which has no toilets available). We will be actively scouring submissions and terminating rulebreakers.I would like to thank the following individuals for making this contest possible:
Myself for coordinating the round . Vladosiya for russian translations. reirugan for improving the statements. The following testuwuers: Proof_by_QED, reirugan, -firefly-, Filikec, LMeyling, mathtsai, __baozii__, Non-origination, chromate00, SpyrosAliv, Intellegent, Dominater069, Hori, RobinFromTheHood, poi, yse, Vladosiya, Lechaa, hashman, macaquedev, catgirl, kingbass, tin.le2, ByteRaider, litfan, AksLolCoding, expertaq, kwant, xorfftdp, minuki646, Hana05, .Habiba., apollo07, shuniko, Jteh, avighnakc, nifeshe, Edeeva, ChickenTamer, wuhudsm, and temporary1.

Kotlin Heroes 13 Announcement
–ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä¬†BledDest,
2 –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥,
Greetings Codeforces!Ready to put your Kotlin skills to the test? Kotlin Heroes is your playground: a chance to experiment with the language's features, tackle fun and challenging problems, and level up your programming abilities. Perfect for beginners and experts alike!A massive shout-out to all the amazing coders who have competed in past Kotlin Heroes events:
Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3, Episode 4, Episode 5: ICPC Round, Episode 6, Episode 7, Episode 8, Episode 9, Episode 10, Episode 11 and Episode 12.Kotlin Heroes is a great way to play around with Kotlin‚Äôs features, learn something new, and practice using the language by solving fun problems. It is great for programmers of any level! We invite you to join the practice round, where you can improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills and complete training problems. In this round, all the solutions are open, and you can request hints if you‚Äôre stuck.Here are some things you can do to help you refresh your knowledge of Kotlin and learn more about competitive programming while you practice:
Read our competitive programming tutorial. Review our Kotlin solutions for the Advent of Code algorithmic puzzles. Watch the videos from our Kotlin in Competitive Programming YouTube playlist. And if you‚Äôd like to see how the top competitive programmers approach these challenges, check out ecnerwala and SecondThread solving problems from this practice round live on stage at the ICPC World Finals in Baku. Mark your calendars for September 12, 2025! Kotlin Heroes: Episode 13 offers 2 hours and 30 minutes of problem-solving, featuring a wide range of tasks designed for everyone, from those just starting out to experienced competitive programmers.The use of AI-based tools during the main contest is strictly limited. To find out the guidelines for proper AI use, what is allowed and what is prohibited, please read the post "Rule Restricting the use of AI". Improper use of AI tools during the main contest may result in disqualification. Using automatic translation tools (including but not limited to neural networks and AI) to convert code written in other programming languages to Kotlin goes against the spirit of the competition, so it is also strictly prohibited.
