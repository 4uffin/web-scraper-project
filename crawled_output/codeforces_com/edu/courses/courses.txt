Welcome to the new Codeforces section. At the moment, its functionality is still under development,
and here is the current progress and β-testing preview.
Write your comments and suggestions in the comments to the post with
the announcement of this section.
The plans include expanding both the functionality of the section and filling it with new content.
At the moment, it is important for us to get the first feedback.
Thanks to ITMO University for the idea and support for the implementation of this initiative.
