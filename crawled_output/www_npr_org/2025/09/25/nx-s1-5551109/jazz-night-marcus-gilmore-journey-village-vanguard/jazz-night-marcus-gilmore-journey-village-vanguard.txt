Ogato
Drummer Marcus Gilmore has been subtly shaping the pulse of modern jazz since he was a teenager. Now in his late 30s, his shapeshifting mastery of his instrument has made him one of the most sought-after percussionists in the field. The late legend Chick Corea recruited his services, as did other innovators of the past few decades such as Steve Coleman, Vijay Iyer and Ambrose Akinmusire. When Gilmore picks up the sticks, people pay attention. So it was a milestone for Gilmore when, in May, he released his first recording as a leader: Journey to the New, recorded at the historic Village Vanguard.

It makes sense for this occasion to occur at the Vanguard. His grandfather, the late Roy Haynes, is one of the most influential drummers of all time. Haynes was a frequent presence on that stage, notably featured in John Coltrane's landmark 1961 Village Vanguard sessions. In this episode, Gilmore sits down with Christian McBride to talk about his connection to the Vanguard, including the moment when his grandfather once invited him to the hallowed stage. Musicians: Marcus Gilmore, drums, percussion; Morgan Guerin, EWI; David Virelles, piano; Emmanuel Michael, guitar; Rashaan Carter, double bass; Burniss Travis, electric bass. Set List: (All selections from Journey to the New: Live at the Village Vanguard) "Voltaire" (Burniss Travis)"Interlude One" (Emmanuel Michael)"Cape Stride" (Marcus Gilmore)"Interlude Two" (Emmanuel Michael)"Journey To The New" (Marcus Gilmore) Credits: Sarah Geledi, writer and producer; Trevor Smith, writer; Simon Rentner, consulting senior producer; Ron Scalzo, mastering engineer; Steven A. Williams, executive producer; Suraya Mohamed, executive producer at NPR Music; Christian McBride, host.
