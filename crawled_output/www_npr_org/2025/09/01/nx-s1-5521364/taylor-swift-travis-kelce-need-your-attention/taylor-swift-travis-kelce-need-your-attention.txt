Taylor Swift / Travis Kelce
A note from It's Been a Minute host Brittany Luse: It's in your feeds, on TV, maybe even in your group chats. One way or another, whether you wanted to know or not, you've already heard the news: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged. Their Instagram announcement is one of the most liked Instagram posts of all time. The caption: "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married." The internet erupted in both cheers and eye rolls, but what struck me is how their personal joy is once again being leveraged for professional gain. And this started from their relationship launch in July 2023.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are in their engagement era
In the eyes of crisis public relations expert Molly McPherson, Swift and Kelce are definitely in a PR relationship, a public-facing link-up that mutually benefits all members of the relationship, whether through millions of album streams, increased social media follower count, or a buzzy award season campaign. And according to McPherson, Swift and Kelce's PR relationship is golden. "When you are one of the top trending news stories and you have an entire organization [the NFL] that has likely stopped all of their digital campaigns, their advertising campaigns, and have shifted quickly ... to embrace this Taylor-Travis relationship, you know that that is a successful public relations relationship." It's obvious this PR relationship has been a success for Kelce. Since Swift began attending Kelce's games, Swifties have flocked to Chiefs' NFL broadcasts, hoping to see their queen at her new perch, the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium. Chiefs ratings went way up, and Kelce's jersey sales increased 400%. So what's in it for Swift, arguably one of the biggest stars in the world?

Takeaways from Taylor Swift's podcast appearance: her new album, romance and more
Her album, The Life of a Showgirl, is coming out next month and some speculate that the news of her engagement could cause the perfect storm of media attention any star would want before a major release. As a permanent A-lister, Swift is well aware of the draw of her love life to the public and has deftly utilized romantic paparazzi snaps and cryptic song lyrics to construct an image of herself as the lovelorn girl-next-door since her early days as a country-pop princess. It's all part of the special recipe – along with songwriting talent, ambition, and a highly mobilized fanbase – that has kept her relevant for nearly 20 years.

Swift's not the first, or the only star to use PR relationships to her advantage. We see this pattern all over the entertainment industry – think collaborative couples like Beyoncé and Jay-Z, or writer/directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. PR relationships are old hat in politics, too. The Obamas are the modern blueprint for a relatable power couple, despite their very unrelatable wealth and influence. They have obvious chemistry and a seemingly genuine bond, and their relationship formed organically pre-fame, but they have also narrativized every aspect of what we know about their marriage. The story of their first date has been turned into a narrative feature film. And while on a promotional tour for her most recent book, Michelle Obama opened up about the resentment she carried when Barack was a young Illinois senator. "Even from Michelle's point of view, you can just still see the bitterness that she had and those years that she was left alone. She gave up her career. She's home with the girls. Why? Barack is the one who gets to ascend," says McPherson. But it's that honesty that McPherson touts as their special sauce. "They're so open about the problems that they've had in their relationship, and what they're able to do is to lean in on that vulnerability," she says. The Obamas understand, perhaps better than any famous pair, that an ideal PR relationship is an opportunity to express your values and ideals without delivering a stump speech. Even PR relationships that don't succeed in the traditional sense can generate buzz and influence for all partners involved. Just look at the tidal wave of discussion that followed actress Jada Pinkett Smith, who revealed that she and her husband of nearly three decades, actor Will Smith, have been privately separated since 2016. This revelation doesn't have the same celebratory tone as an engagement announcement, but it did seem likely to move copies of Pinkett Smith's memoir. The best PR relationships don't need to work out, they just need to work for each star's respective brand.

After the news of Taylor and Travis' engagement broke, McPherson was quick to let her TikTok audience know that a Swift-Kelce wedding isn't proof of fairytale ending, but further proof of the couple's business savvy. "This is gonna be the PR marriage of a lifetime," said McPherson in a TikTok post. "Think about the album sales. Think about the podcast, the brands, the wedding. Oh my gosh, the money, the money, the money." So what can we expect from the future of the Swift-Kelce union? It's probably too soon to say, but I'm sure they'll let us know.
