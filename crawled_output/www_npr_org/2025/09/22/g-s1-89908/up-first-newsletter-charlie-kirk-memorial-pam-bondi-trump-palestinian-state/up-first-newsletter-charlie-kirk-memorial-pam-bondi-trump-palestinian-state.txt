Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter.¬†Subscribe¬†here to get it delivered to your inbox, and¬†listen¬†to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day. Today's top stories President Trump and several other top administration officials eulogized political activist Charlie Kirk yesterday. Trump said the 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA is "a martyr now for American freedom" at the memorial service, less than two weeks after he was killed. Kirk was seen as a prominent leader within the MAGA movement who worked to bring young people into the conservative fold.

üéß The service was held at an NFL stadium, which was packed to the rafters, and many attendees wore white T-shirts with the word "freedom" across the front, NPR's Tamara Keith tells Up First. This was the same shirt Kirk was wearing when he was shot. Almost every speaker mentioned that Kirk's assassination wouldn't silence the activist's message, but instead, it would make it louder. When Trump spoke, he veered off topic, bringing up the 2020 election, tariffs and his political rivals. Overall, Keith says the memorial was infused with Christianity, praise music and Bible verses.‚û°Ô∏è Erika Kirk, Charlie's widow, wiped away tears as she told the massive crowd at the service that she forgives the man accused of killing her husband. Here's what else she said during her speech.‚û°Ô∏è Tens of thousands of supporters attended the Kirk memorial in Arizona. See photos from the event.

In a social media post published over the weekend, Trump pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate his political rivals. The post mentioned former FBI director James Comey, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and New York State Attorney General Letitia James. The president says all three are guilty, and nothing is being done about it. He didn't specify what they are guilty of.
üéß Trump talked about going after his perceived political enemies if he returned to office throughout his 2024 presidential campaign. He hasn't toned down that message, and NPR's Ryan Lucas says, "this is arguably the most direct" message he has made since his return to the White House. He is urging the Justice Department to use significant powers to go after specific people. The declaration for Bondi to take action comes after Erik Siebert, a top prosecutor, resigned after pressure from the Trump administration to charge James, a Trump foe, in a mortgage fraud investigation. These developments are fueling concerns that the administration is weaponizing the DOJ, Lucas says. Today, France and several other major Western countries, including Canada, the U.K., Portugal and Australia, will recognize a Palestinian state. These countries' leaders say a two-state solution is the only route to peace. Their decision comes as the United Nations begins its week-long General Assembly gathering in New York City. The U.N. is expected to heighten pressure on the U.S. and Israel as the war in Gaza approaches its third year.

üéß Palestinian leaders are quickly welcoming the move, according to NPR's Carrie Kahn. However, many in the Israeli-occupied West Bank say the recognition doesn't change the reality of how difficult life there has been since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. The number of people arrested and killed by Israeli forces has skyrocketed, and Israel has canceled work permits for 200,000 Palestinians. Last night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the recognition of a Palestinian state rewards Hamas for terrorism. Netanyahu has threatened retaliation, but he says he will wait until after he addresses the U.N. and meets with Trump. Cost of living

NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. The price of ground beef has risen by 51% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Despite these rising prices, American shoppers have continued to show their preference for burgers and steaks ‚Äî until now. Here are the factors influencing the beef industry:
üçî Severe drought made it difficult for many farmers to irrigate the fields their cattle fed on. In 2022, producers slaughtered more beef cows than ever before in the USDA recordkeeping. At the time, they were already experiencing losses from the pandemic.üçî The slaughter led to an oversupply of meat, dropping beef prices and discouraging ranchers from replenishing their herds.üçî Repopulation remains very slow because of high operational costs. Ranchers are hesitant to invest in expansion.üçî Imports of foreign beef are decreasing. Brazilian beef faces a 76% tariff, and the USDA has blocked livestock from Mexico to the U.S. due to concerns over the screwworm parasite. Read more about how grocery stores, restaurants and consumers are adjusting to the change in beef prices. Plus, take a look at why grocery prices are so high and what people are doing about it. This week, the series will cover how the housing market is impacting families. Stay up-to-date on the latest stories here.
