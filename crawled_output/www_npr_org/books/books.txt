Life in a Christian Commune
September 14, 2025 • As a young woman, Kate Riley’s search for meaning led her to a Christian commune. She lived there for a year and embraced collective life – everyone dressed the same and no one owned any private property. Kids growing up there didn’t have contact with cell phones or money.

These experiences informed her first novel, Ruth.
