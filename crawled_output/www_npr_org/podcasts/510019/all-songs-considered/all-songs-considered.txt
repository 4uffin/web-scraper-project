Alt.Latino: New songs from Spain, the D.R. and more
September 24, 2025 • The way new music comes to Alt.Latino World Headquarters says a lot about our slight age difference. I still get CDs in the mail, with an occasional music file sent via email. Ana is constantly playing me audio files she gets vial email or texts from her new music sources, very rarely on CD. So while we were busy putting the finishing touches on our fist annual El Tiny takeover of the Tiny Desk Concert series, our mail piled up. Which means we had lots to choose from for this week's new music episode. There's bound to be something that catches your ear and makes you think: 'How did I live without that in my life?"
