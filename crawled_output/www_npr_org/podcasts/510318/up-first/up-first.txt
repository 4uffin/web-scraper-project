Casualties of Trump’s War on Higher Ed

Life in a Christian Commune
September 14, 2025 • As a young woman, Kate Riley’s search for meaning led her to a Christian commune.

In this week’s conversation, Riley sits down with Ayesha Rascoe to explore what it means to be an individual in a communal place. And she shares what she learned about her own identity. These experiences informed her first novel, Ruth.
