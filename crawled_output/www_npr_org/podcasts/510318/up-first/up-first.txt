Charlie Kirk Memorial, Trump Pressures DOJ, Palestinian State Recognition
September 22, 2025 • President Trump and top officials turned Charlie Kirk’s memorial into both a tribute and a political rally, with Trump calling him a martyr and vowing to continue his fight.

He’s complained about antisemitism on campuses, of gender- and race-based course offerings, even communist indoctrination. To force change, the government has increasingly used the power of money. It’s withheld billions in research funding and clamped down on international student visas. This week on The Sunday Story, NPR Correspondent Elissa Nadworny explores what the disruption means for the future of higher education in America.
