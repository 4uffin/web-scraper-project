Flaco Jimenez and Eddie Palmieri: Why Their Music Mattered
by
Felix Contreras
,
Anamaria Artemisa Sayre
August 20, 2025 • On Alt.Latino we often discuss the way that traditions are recognized and expanded upon. Usually it’s when we’re talking about new artists. But this week we are spending time honoring two legends: Tex Mex accordion player Flaco Jimenez and Latin jazz pianist/composer Eddie Palmieri each died within the last few weeks. They were foundational to their respective musical cultures, products of two distinct Latino cultural and musical traditions who also expanded the idea of tradition with their musical visions. Tune in this week to see how Felix connects the dots between these two seemingly dissimilar icons — and hear some new music that also blends tradition with modernity.    Music heard in this episode:Orquestra Afro-Brasileira, “Saudação ao Rei Nagô” and “Obaluayê”Doctor Nativo, “Caminantes” feat. Roco PachukoteBikôkô, “The Other” feat. Isaiah Hull and “La Mano” feat Crystal Murrayday2k, “OBSSD” and “más q todoooooo”Flaco Jimenez, “Lucerito”Eddie Palmieri, “Una Rosa Española”  Audio and production for this episode was done by Noah Caldwell.Suraya Mohamed is Executive Producer for NPR Music.
