Photos: Decades in, these women's love was 'Hidden Once, Hidden Twice'
June 26, 2025 • Morgan Lieberman's "Hidden Once, Hidden Twice" is a documentary photo and film project bringing visibility to the lives of senior lesbian couples across the U.S.
The photo exhibit Sahy Rano, on display at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York, through this weekend, draws its title from a Malagasay phrase translated in a wall label as meaning "someone who is not afraid to dive into the water, even if there is a strong current." The photographer wants to bring attention to female genital schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by a waterborne parasitic infection, whose symptoms can be stigmatizing because they resemble symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases. From left to right: former patients Rahama Abdallah, Sylvia Razanaparana and Suzanie Yolandrie. They were photographed in September 2024 in the district of Ambanja in Northern Madagascar.

This may be the most lead polluted place on Earth. Is there any hope?

The boy and bird are, of course, not really flying together. But ... they are both airborne. The child is jumping into the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok, Thailand, during a heatwave in February 2024. Photographer Andre Malerba notes: "This image recalls the free feeling of leaping from several times one's height into water to escape the heat as friends laugh and cheer you on. A time many of us might remember as when we felt truly whole and at peace, even if life wasn't perfect. It's always worth realizing that this version of ourselves still exists somewhere inside and to let that lend us a sense of well-being that can never be taken away."
