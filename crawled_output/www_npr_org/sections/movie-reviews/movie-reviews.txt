September 25, 2025 • Showgirls stars Elizabeth Berkley as a Vegas dancer trying to move up from a seedy club to a glamorous hotel show.

Showgirls turns 30 this year, so today we’re revisiting our conversation about the film.

Body horror and elite athletes make a grisly pairing in ‘Him’
September 19, 2025 • In the new horror film HIM, Tyriq Withers stars as a young football player who has a chance to be trained by his idol, played by Marlon Wayans.

The dream of the ’90s is alive in ‘Caught Stealing’
September 2, 2025 • Austin Butler, Zoë Kravitz and Bad Bunny star in Caught Stealing, the new grungy, throwback film from Darren Aronofsky.

When his British punk neighbor Russ, played by Matt Smith, asks him to cat sit, Hank finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. His life comes apart as the criminal underworld becomes convinced he knows where a huge cache of stolen cash can be found. Will Hank fight back? Can he?
