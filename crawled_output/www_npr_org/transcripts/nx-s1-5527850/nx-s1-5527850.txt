ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The University of Alabama boasts 18 college football national championships. One man has been there for a dozen of them. Eddie Conyers spent more than 60 years as a referee at practices for the Crimson Tide, working under such legendary coaches as Bear Bryant and Nick Saban. NPR's Debbie Elliott caught up with Conyers, still roaming the sidelines to make sure practice officials are up to the task.DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: The University of Alabama's football practice field is hidden from public view behind a shrouded security fence on the edge of the leafy Tuscaloosa campus.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Good run, Dre (ph). Good run, Dre.(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE WHISTLING)ELLIOTT: This practice is full speed, full contact, full intensity, with a full complement of officials on the field.EDDIE CONYERS: Hey, back judge. Back judge. How you doing, buddy?UNIDENTIFIED REFEREE: Oh, hey.E CONYERS: Hey, man, how you doing? Boy, good to see...UNIDENTIFIED REFEREE: Don't sneak up on me like that.E CONYERS: Yeah.UNIDENTIFIED REFEREE: I got a flag if you want to use it.E CONYERS: No, no.ELLIOTT: That's Eddie Conyers, age 97, quick with a joke as he checks in with practice officials. Until this season, he, too, would have been on the field, the referee lined up in the offensive backfield.E CONYERS: This is the first year in 60 years I've not done this.ELLIOTT: Conyers has transitioned now to an off-field role overseeing scheduling for the practice officials and serving as a mentor from the sidelines.E CONYERS: Ooh.ELLIOTT: The Bama practice ref is a role he helped pioneer after being recruited by Coach Paul Bear Bryant more than six decades ago.E CONYERS: I came through a gate right down here in 1962, and they said, Bryant wants to talk to you. Yeah, I can't tell you how terrified and intimidated I was 'cause I'd worked high school four years. How do you know the first thing about college?ELLIOTT: He says Bryant's theory was to work out all the penalties at practice in hopes of fewer game infractions. And Conyers wanted to be a part of it. So he left his day job at a local hardware store a few hours early, ducked into a service station restroom to change into zebra stripes and reported for duty.E CONYERS: I remember I asked Coach Bryant, what do you want me to do? I didn't have a clue. Coach Bryant talked low, and he mumbled. He said something like, I don't - go watch (inaudible). I ain't have a clue what he said. And I just said, OK.Are we ready?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We're ready.ELLIOTT: These days, Conyers drives a golf cart to get from the locker room to the practice field and uses a walker to steady his gait. He can't fully straighten his neck because of all the knocks he's taken over the years, but that doesn't slow him down much. Zipping along in the golf cart, he's treated like a celebrity, even by celebrities.MARK INGRAM: Oh, Eddie's the man. He's the legend.E CONYERS: Well, the only thing held Mark back, he just wasn't no good.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, he wasn't no good.INGRAM: (Laughter).E CONYERS: But he made up for it by being slower, didn't he?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yep.ELLIOTT: It's Mark Ingram, Alabama's first Heisman winner and former NFL running back who's now a TV sports analyst.INGRAM: You know, you know what you mean to us? You know what you mean to us down here? You the legend. You're the GOAT, man.E CONYERS: Well, that's just for the women.INGRAM: Yeah, you know that for sure. That's for sure.(LAUGHTER)ELLIOTT: They compare championship rings, Conyers ribbing Ingram about how many more he has, a dozen to show for his years with the team. Joking aside, Ingram says Conyers made an impression on players like him.INGRAM: Man, Eddie was just always there, man. Eddie was always the constant constant, you know what I mean? And always the same, always happy, always joyful. Made all of us happy to see him.ELLIOTT: Conyers has thrown flags at some of the best players to take the field, the likes of Joe Namath, Kenny Snake Stabler, Jalen Hurts and Derrick Henry. He was there for Coach Bryant's super secretive plan for the Crimson Tide to go to a wishbone offense in the early 1970s. About the same time, the team recruited its first Black players. Conyers says Bama's winningest coaches had distinct styles.E CONYERS: From Coach Bryant you learn that you can do more than you think you can do. He talked about 110%, but he wanted that every play of every game, that you give all you can give, and then you give a little bit more. Coach Saban, it may sound kind of trite, you did everything right.JEFF ALLEN: This place is built on history and tradition at Alabama. There's no place like it. And Eddie is such a wonderful link to the history and the tradition of this place.ELLIOTT: Athletic trainer Jeff Allen is senior associate athletic director for sports medicine. Over his 19 years at Alabama, he's developed a close relationship with Eddie Conyers. The two travel the state together to speak to civic groups and athletic booster clubs.ALLEN: Eddie was the only man in 17 years that was brave enough to talk back to Nick Saban.E CONYERS: (Laughter).ALLEN: And I've got so many wonderful stories of him firing right back at Coach Saban. I never saw anybody else do it. Eddie had no fear.ELLIOTT: Conyers' cheery disposition also served as a buffer at times between, let's say, an intense coach and the practice reps, according to one of them, Tom Danner.TOM DANNER: Thing about Eddie, he's very even tempered, and you really can't ever pull anything on him. A lot of times, when everybody was going crazy, he was the calm one in the bunch. Like, coaches and players, they might be upset, but his mannerisms never changed. He was always the same through every practice and every scrimmage.ELLIOTT: Conyers, a Navy veteran, made his career working in Alabama's college of continuing education as an assistant to the dean. But his passion has always been the side gig as a football practice rep, says his son, Bubba Conyers.BUBBA CONYERS: He likes the relationship with the players. It's always something funny or a joke, maybe it's kind of a little vacation when they talk to him. It's going to be funny and a lot of fun and no heartache.(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE WHISTLING)ELLIOTT: He may have hung up his whistle, but Eddie Conyers still brings his jovial spirit to Bama practices.E CONYERS: Hey, where's my flag?ELLIOTT: Another tradition he's not ready to give up - for every away game, Conyers and Peggy, his wife of 76 years, show up at the airport to wave off the team with a big Roll Tide send-off.Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
