STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
Prices are rising for health care and car insurance and groceries and entertainment. NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is looking at why that's happening and how consumers are handling it all. Laurel Wamsley has the story of high housing prices that affect big choices in some people's lives.LAUREL WAMSLEY, BYLINE: Ava Rimal and her husband had a plan for their life together in New Jersey post law school.AVA RIMAL: I always thought I wanted to have two kids.WAMSLEY: They had one. But as their son reached preschool, their two-bedroom house in Asbury Park started feeling small. A new plan came into focus when they visited Rimal's co-worker in the South Jersey town of Collingswood, near Philadelphia.RIMAL: It looked like a Hallmark movie. There were just, like, kids everywhere and people singing. It was just nuts.WAMSLEY: So they sold their home and last year managed to buy a three-bedroom house in Collingswood. But it stretched their budget for the long haul. Their mortgage is now almost $5,000 a month, more than double what they were paying before.RIMAL: We bought the house with three bedrooms to kind of preserve the possibility of having another kid. But we didn't know that the interest rates were going to be so high or that we'd end up spending a hundred thousand dollars more than we wanted to. And when we looked at the numbers and the cost of day care down here, with the mortgage, we just can't afford it.WAMSLEY: By that, she means a second kid. Rimal knows that as a household of two lawyers, they are lucky to have solid incomes. But when she sees her realtor share on Instagram cheaper, bigger homes in Philadelphia, she wonders, what if? The median sales price for existing single-family homes rose 50% between July 2019 and July of this year. And mortgage rates jumped from pandemic lows below 3% to above 7% earlier this year, though in recent weeks, they've dipped below 6 1/2. Rimal is now 40 and is content with one child. To afford another, they would've had to make very different decisions, and their lifestyle would change, too.RIMAL: I'd rather have one kid that I can give everything to than try to spread it thin between two children just for the sake of having two children.WAMSLEY: This steep cost of housing is pushing other Americans to make the same choice Rimal and her husband did. To make the math work on housing and day care and everything else for some means a smaller family than they had once envisioned. And the high cost of housing is causing some people to conclude they don't want kids at all.Chelsea Clouser is 29 and lives in Davis, California. She works in fundraising, and her husband teaches high school. When she was younger, she was interested in having kids.CHELSEA CLOUSER: But then as I've gotten older and as I started working and kind of experienced how difficult it is to feel financially comfortable, it's just become less and less desirable for me.WAMSLEY: Part of that calculation is the cost of housing. Clouser and her husband pay $2,400 a month to rent a one-bedroom apartment that already feels too small sometimes with just their cat. Over the last six years, rents nationally rose 17%. Clouser's rent has gone up every year she's lived in Davis.CLOUSER: We want to eventually buy a house. And so if we had a kid while we're renting, that would just be so impossible.WAMSLEY: The cost of their rent - plus the fees for parking, storage and a pet - means saving up for a down payment is difficult, especially when the cost to buy is so high. The typical home in Davis sold last month for $843,000.CLOUSER: Housing in Davis and California in general is very, very expensive, and we don't really want to move out of state. So having a child and how much more difficult that would make things for us just doesn't really seem worth it.WAMSLEY: But even if housing were cheaper, Clouser said she would still have reservations. She worries about the economy and about layoffs at work. She doesn't want the added worry of providing enough opportunities for a child.Laurel Wamsley, NPR News.INSKEEP: The series is Cost of Living: The Price We Pay, and it comes to you at the same price as ever. It's free.
