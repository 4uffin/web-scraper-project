AILSA CHANG, HOST:
In response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, A-list Hollywood actors and filmmakers have pledged to boycott the Israeli film industry. As NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, their action comes at a time when Israel's cultural minister is also threatening his country's film and television academy.MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: On the red carpet at the Emmy Awards Sunday, actor Javier Bardem wore a kaffiyeh, a black and white Palestinian scarf.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAVIER BARDEM: Here I am today, denouncing the genocide in Gaza.DEL BARCO: Bardem is among more than 4,000 Hollywood figures - including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo - who signed the pledge organized by the group Film Workers for Palestine. Bardem told a reporter at Variety, they're boycotting Israeli-funded institutions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARDEM: I cannot work with somebody that justify or supports a genocide. I can't. The targets are those film companies and institutions that are complicit and are whitewashing or justifying the genocide of Israel and its apartheid regime.DEL BARCO: Israel has denied accusations of genocide, the latest of which came from a U.N. commission of inquiry this week. Onstage at the Emmys, as she accepted the award for outstanding supporting actress for a comedy, Hannah Einbinder said this.(SOUNDBITE OF 77TH EMMY AWARDS BROADCAST)HANNAH EINBINDER: And free Palestine. Thank you.DEL BARCO: Backstage, Einbinder told reporters, the boycott is meant to pressure the Israeli government to stop the war.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EINBINDER: It's an issue that's very dear to my heart. I have friends in Gaza who are working as frontline workers, as doctors right now to provide care for pregnant women and schoolchildren to create schools in the refugee camps. It is my obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel.DEL BARCO: Organizers of the pledge say they were inspired by a letter in the 1980s signed by Hollywood filmmakers, such as Spike Lee, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese. They refused to screen their films in apartheid South Africa. Film Workers for Palestine emphasizes that their boycott is not aimed at individuals, but institutions, such as Israeli film production and distribution companies, even film festivals.But their stance has drawn backlash from some Jewish leaders and organizations and from Paramount. The movie studio condemned the boycott, saying in a statement, quote, "silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace." And some Israeli movie industry groups are pushing back. The nonprofit group Friends of the Israeli Producers Association called the boycott profoundly misguided. Assaf Amir, who heads the Israeli Academy of Film and Television, says the boycott is counterproductive.ASSAF AMIR: We understand that people are trying to somehow affect the war in Gaza. Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to help stop the war. It might mute our voices. I mean, we have an industry that fights and makes critical films. Most of us are right now under a vicious attack, I would say, by the government.DEL BARCO: Amir says he and other Israeli filmmakers have long challenged the very government they sometimes rely on for state funding.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DEL BARCO: This week, the Israeli Academy gave its prestigious Ophir award to the anti drama "The Sea." It follows a 12-year-old Palestinian boy living under occupation in the West Bank who risks his life to go to the beach in Tel Aviv.(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE SEA")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, non-English language spoken).UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, non-English language spoken).UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, non-English language spoken).UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, non-English language spoken).DEL BARCO: The film was produced by a Palestinian, directed by an Israeli and the actors are Palestinian Israelis. This week, the Israeli Academy chose "The Sea" as its official entry for the upcoming Oscars International Features race. But Israel's Minister of Culture and Sports, Miki Zohar, called the film's depiction of Israeli soldiers disgraceful. This week, he threatened to pull all the state funding from the Israeli Academy. Zohar also announced he's creating the State Israel Oscars. Amir says Israeli filmmakers are aghast.AMIR: The fact that the minister doesn't like the results of our competition, he doesn't like the film and it doesn't fit his political agenda doesn't make it right for him to just decide that he's going to take our money and create his own competition. It's absurd.DEL BARCO: Amir says the state of Israel does not care what Hollywood celebrities have to say. Instead, he argues, the government might even welcome a boycott as a way of punishing Israeli filmmakers. Mandalit del Barco, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
