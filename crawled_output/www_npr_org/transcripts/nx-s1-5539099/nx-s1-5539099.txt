LEILA FADEL, HOST:
What grows in the ocean, is packed full of nutrients and, according to wellness influencers, can do everything from boosting your gut health to giving you glowing skin? It's sea moss, one of the latest social media superfoods. NPR's Maria Godoy asked around to see whether there's evidence to support the hype.MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Type the words sea moss into the TikTok search bar, and you'll run into videos like this one from content creator Georgia Ning.(SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK VIDEO)GEORGIA NING: I tried sea moss about three weeks ago. And, oh, my gosh, this is my holy grail now.GODOY: She says it helped clear her acne and gave her radiant skin. Other claims for sea moss include supporting immunity and thyroid health, increasing energy and helping with weight management. Interest in sea moss has exploded in recent years, with celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Hailey Bieber touting it as part of their wellness routines. Vanessa King is a spokesperson for the American Academy of Dietetics. She says you've probably eaten a sea moss product without knowing it. It's long been harvested for its carrageenan, which is used in the food industry as a thickening agent.VANESSA KING: You'll find it in your ice cream, your sauces, any custards and pudding.GODOY: These days, sea moss is sold as powders, dried flakes, pills, gummies. Often, it's soaked in water and sold in a gooey gel form.KING: Sea moss is really a generic term to describe different red seaweed plants.GODOY: It grows in the North Atlantic, especially around the Irish coast, and in warmer waters like parts of the Caribbean. King says in both those regions, it's been used as a form of food as medicine since at least the 1800s.KING: And in all these years, from the 1800s to now, we still don't have much research to support the health claims that our celebrities are endorsing.GODOY: Most of the claims are based on cell or animal studies, which don't always translate to humans. That's not to say sea moss has no health benefits. Dr. Melinda Ring practices integrative medicine at Northwestern University. She says sea moss in its whole form is a good source of fiber, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals like zinc, which do support gut and immune health. But you can also find those in other foods.MELINDA RING: So can it be potentially beneficial? Yes. Can it be more beneficial than other sources? Probably not. It's just one of many things that we can use to support our health.GODOY: Ring says there are also potential risks from consuming too much sea moss.RING: Sea moss can accumulate heavy metals like arsenic, lead and mercury, particularly if it's been sourced from contaminated water. So that's a big concern.GODOY: Another concern? Sea moss is rich in iodine. We need some iodine for good thyroid health.RING: It's just when they take too much that it becomes a problem.GODOY: ...Potentially triggering thyroid dysfunction. Ring says people on blood thinners with thyroid disorders or who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid sea moss. She says others who want to try it should opt for sea moss as a whole food or gel instead of in supplements. Or you could just skip sea moss altogether. I asked registered dietitian Diana Guevara if sea moss is more health elixir or hype.DIANA GUEVARA: Definitely hype. You know, we want things to be easy and quick.GODOY: Guevara is with UTHealth Houston. She says when it comes to good health, there's no single magic pill.GUEVARA: It really is just that whole lifestyle of including more fruits, more vegetables, more whole grains and really just looking for that balance.GODOY: It may not be trendy, but it is backed by science.Maria Godoy, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF DA SEIN'S "DEW")
