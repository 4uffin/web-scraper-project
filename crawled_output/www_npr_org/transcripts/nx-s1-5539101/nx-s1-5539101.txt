SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Caterpillars are a prized delicacy in the Democratic Republic of Congo, fetching higher prices alongside cheaper and popular beetle grubs. They are a valuable source of protein in a country where many people can't afford to buy fresh meat or fish. Emmet Livingstone reports from the Marche Liberte neighborhood in the capital, Kinshasa.EMMET LIVINGSTONE, BYLINE: This is the most densely populated part of the city of about 17 million people. The roads and the alleyways are packed. It's a never-ending riot of sound and activity. In this sprawling market, you can get everything from electronics to knock-off clothes. But lots of people come here to buy a Congolese delicacy - edible larvae and caterpillars.(SOUNDBITE OF MARKET AMBIENCE)LIVINGSTONE: A shopper is asking for mbinzo - or caterpillars - in Kinshasa's main language, Lingala. Mamman Coco, a vendor, sits by plastic buckets heaped with foodstuffs, such as maize flour and dried caterpillars from the Congolese interior.MAMMAN COCO: (Speaking Lingala).LIVINGSTONE: "People love to eat caterpillars. They have lots of protein and are organic," says Mamman Coco. And these aren't just any caterpillars, but the caterpillars of emperor moths - long, greenish and hairy. They come from the forested areas upriver and cost $200 a kilo, an enormous sum in a poor country like Congo.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).LIVINGSTONE: In another section of the market, Tresor Kisanbu has just bought some freshly grilled caterpillars spiced with chili.TRESOR KISANBU: (Speaking French).LIVINGSTONE: "It's better to eat than fresh meat. If you eat them, you'll have a long life, and it strengthens the muscles and the eyes," he says.KISANBU: (Speaking French).LIVINGSTONE: Consumption of larvae is traditional in some parts of Congo, but not everywhere. In some places, eating grubs may be a relatively recent phenomenon driven by rising poverty.ERNESTINE LONPI TIPI: (Speaking French).LIVINGSTONE: Ernestine Lonpi Tipi is a researcher who has studied the consumption of larvae in Congo.LONPI TIPI: (Speaking French).LIVINGSTONE: She found the practice began to skyrocket in the late 1970s.(SOUNDBITE OF INSECTS CHIRPING)LIVINGSTONE: The destruction of forests led to a lack of bush meat, which meant that people had to turn to other protein sources. A lack of jobs also meant that people had less money to spend on meat. Caterpillars are a delicacy. But other types of larvae, such as maggots of palm weevils, a type of beetle, are cheaper and more common. These maggots grow inside rotting palm trees and are sold fresh and wriggling throughout Kinshasa. Francoise Lukadi runs a Congolese NGO called Farms for Orphans, which donates larvae to orphanages in Kinshasa. It has its own maggot farm, one of the few that exist in the city. In a long, dark room, rows of plastic tubs are stacked on shelves. Inside are thousands of growing grubs.FRANCOISE LUKADI: (Speaking French).LIVINGSTONE: "This morning, we're doing a check," she says as workers move the larvae into new buckets containing bits of palm bark and other organic matter, which they feed on. Farms for Orphans also sells some of its produce.LUKADI: (Speaking French).LIVINGSTONE: "In Congo, meat products are too expensive for lots of people," she says, "but nutritious larvae are accessible to everyone."For NPR News, I'm Emmet Livingstone in Kinshasa.
