AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:
Time to play the Puzzle.(SOUNDBITE OF STEVEN HENLEY JR.'S "PLAY THE PUZZLE")RASCOE: Joining us this week is Will Shortz. He's puzzle editor of The New York Times and puzzlemaster of WEEKEND EDITION. How's it going, Will?WILL SHORTZ: Excellent. How are you, Ayesha?RASCOE: I am good - enjoying the fall and the fall weather (laughter). So, Will, would you please remind us of last week's challenge?SHORTZ: Yes, it came from Bob Weisz (ph). I said in a certain classic film the protagonist uses two weapons. The name of one of these has 10 letters. And I said, if you take the first letter and the last six letters, you can rearrange them to spell the name of the other weapon that he uses in seven letters. What weapons are these? Well, the first one is a lightsaber, which Luke Skywalker uses in "Star Wars." Take those letters, and you can also spell blaster.RASCOE: Seems like a lot of y'all got that because there were more than 1,300 correct entries. And this week's winner is Stephanie O'Neil of Jamesville, New York. Congratulations, Stephanie.STEPHANIE O'NEIL: Thank you.RASCOE: So how did you figure out this week's answer?O'NEIL: So my family listens to the Puzzle together, and I do have to give credit to my husband for coming up with the answer very quickly. I double checked it, of course, and agreed that it was right, but I'm taking credit and submitting the answer for a chance.RASCOE: OK, OK. So he came up with it, but you're the one who did the administrative work of submitting it (laughter).O'NEIL: Correct.RASCOE: Exactly. So you get the credit.O'NEIL: Yes.RASCOE: (Laughter) So what is your family? So it's you, your husband. Is anybody else?O'NEIL: Yeah, I have three daughters, and we usually listen to the Puzzle in the car, so they always listen along, and they are very excited about this.RASCOE: Oh, that is awesome. So how long have you been playing the Puzzle?O'NEIL: I think that we've been regularly listening for about four years or so and submitting when we can figure it out.RASCOE: Well, I'm glad y'all are listening. I'm glad your daughters are listening. We need another generation of listeners. So I'm very happy about that. What do you do when you're not playing the Puzzle?O'NEIL: I am the school secretary at Fabius-Pompey Elementary School, so I'm pretty busy with that and my kids. But when I have me time, I like sewing and crafty things.RASCOE: Oh, my goodness. Oh, well, that is wonderful. And I'm sure everybody at the school is going to be rooting you on. But I got to ask you, Stephanie, are you ready to play the Puzzle?O'NEIL: I'm going to try. I'm ready.RASCOE: Oh, yeah. You're ready. It's going to be great (laughter). All right, take it away, Will.SHORTZ: All right, Stephanie, you're definitely ready for this. I'm going to give you clues to some famous people. The first two letters of each clue are the answer's initials. For example, if I said media exec at Disney once, you would say Michael Eisner because Michael Eisner has the initials ME, and those are the first two letters of the clue. Here we go. Scowling judge on "America's Got Talent."O'NEIL: Simon Cowell.SHORTZ: Simon Cowell. You got it. Employs many people at Tesla and SpaceX.O'NEIL: Elon Musk.SHORTZ: You got it. A CNN host.O'NEIL: Anderson Cooper.SHORTZ: You got it. Chariot-riding actor in "Ben-Hur."O'NEIL: Charlton HestonSHORTZ: Charlton Heston is right. Good job. Eminent French leader.O'NEIL: Emmanuel Macron.SHORTZ: You got it. How about American playwright who wrote "Death Of A Salesman"?O'NEIL: Oh, Arthur Miller.SHORTZ: Arthur Miller is it. Good. How about this? - cleared the Atlantic in the spirit of St. Louis.O'NEIL: Charles Lindbergh.SHORTZ: You got it. And here's your last one. By his efforts, the Mormon Church settled in Utah.O'NEIL: Brigham Young.SHORTZ: You got it. Nice job.RASCOE: So you did a wonderful job. How do you feel?O'NEIL: I feel better now.RASCOE: For playing our puzzle today, you'll get a weekend edition lapel pin, as well as puzzle books and games. You can read all about it at npr.org/puzzle. And Stephanie, what member station do you listen to?O'NEIL: I listen to WRVO in Oswego and Syracuse.RASCOE: That's Stephanie O'Neil of Jamesville, New York. Thank you so much for playing the Puzzle.O'NEIL: Thank you, Will, so much.RASCOE: OK, Will, what's next week's challenge?SHORTZ: Yes. It comes from Dave Shukan (ph) of San Marino, California. Take the phrase Eastern Time, change one letter in it and rearrange the result to name a place that observes Eastern Time. So again, the phrase Eastern Time, change one letter and rearrange the result to name a place that observes Eastern Time. What is it?RASCOE: You have your assignment, Puzzlers.
