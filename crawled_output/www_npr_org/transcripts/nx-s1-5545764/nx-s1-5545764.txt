STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
The president's talk about antifa has raised some questions.LEILA FADEL, HOST:
Yeah. Trump said on social media he will designate it a, quote, "major terrorist organization." So what is the group, really, and what can the government do to it?INSKEEP: NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef is covering this. Good morning.ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: I want to remind people of the backdrop. Charlie Kirk was murdered. There is a suspect in custody in Utah. Republicans, some of them, though, were immediately saying, quote, "they" killed Charlie Kirk, and the administration began talking of rolling up its political critics, critical groups. Where does antifa fit into all that?YOUSEF: Well, antifa is shorthand for anti-fascist, and it's really more of a movement than a cohesive organization. But top Republican leaders, including President Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, have suggested, without evidence, that antifa or purported funders of antifa may be involved in the Kirk killing. Now, the man who is charged with that crime does not have any known affiliation with antifa. And so far, he's the only person charged in connection with the killing. But this focus on funders is notable because it distinguishes this round of scrutiny from what happened in 2020. You may recall, Steve, back then, President Trump called for antifa to be designated a terrorist group. That failed in large part because, again, it's not a centralized organization but also because there is simply no legal mechanism to do this.INSKEEP: What do you mean by that? Because when he says, designate them as a terrorist group, it sounds very legal.YOUSEF: So there is a process to designate certain groups as foreign terrorist organizations. So think ISIS, al-Qaida. That process lies with the State Department, and it requires proof of a foreign connection. But there is no such process or legal authority right now to do the same with domestic groups. And the reason is that such a designation could infringe on Americans' First Amendment rights.INSKEEP: So much discussion of the First Amendment now.YOUSEF: Yeah.INSKEEP: So when the president uses his First Amendment right to say this on social media, are there any teeth behind it?YOUSEF: Well, there are still a couple reasons to track this, I'm told. You know, first, in 2020, Trump was also calling for the designation of Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. It didn't happen then, but it has happened now. And so this expansion in the application of the term terrorist is already underway. Also, even a rhetorical conflation of antifa with terrorism has been shown to have real-world consequences.I spoke with Faiza Patel at the Brennan Center for Justice. She said when that happened in 2020, law enforcement at every level turned their attention and resources toward finding antifa at protests and trying to establish that it was a national organization. Those efforts failed, but this time, Patel says the impacts could be even broader.FAIZA PATEL: It's pretty clear from the president's tweet that he is focused on the funding of these groups, right? And what that means is that there's potentially a broad array of civil society organizations that can be caught up in this as being potentially linked to anti-fascism in some way or the other.YOUSEF: And I'll add, Steve, yesterday on Air Force One, NPR asked the president how he would go after antifa, since it's more of an ideology than a formal organization. He said, we're going to find out, and then asked our colleague if antifa had anything to do with NPR.INSKEEP: OK. That's NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef. Thanks so much.YOUSEF: Thank you.
