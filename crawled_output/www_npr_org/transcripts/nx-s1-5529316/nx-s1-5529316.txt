AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:
OK, here's the deal. I got up early this morning to host this show for you guys, you know, like, early, early. Now, I'm not complaining, but this does mean that I'm not getting all dressed up and going out to the club on the weekends, usually.I'll get the mango margarita.But one Friday night, earlier this month, I got cute, took some photos and went dancing.What got you on the dance floor?MINDY BOHANNON: Oh, 'cause I love the music and I can swing my arms while it's still early.RASCOE: Fifty-six-year-old Mindy Bohannon is the first person on the dance floor. It's 6 p.m. on the dot. Now, I know what you're thinking - 6 p.m.?LAURA BAGINSKI: Because we can't be out all night anymore. We've got [expletive] to do in the morning.RASCOE: That's Laura Baginski. She's one of the founders of Earlybirds Club. Their pop-up dance parties run from 6 to 10 p.m. And they're for women - anyone can come, but it's mostly women -
who want to dance hard and then still get a full 8 hours of sleep.BAGINSKI: I love to see live music, but what I didn't love about it was that the shows start at 8, but that's when the opening band comes on. That's just crazy for me. I am 50 years old. I have no time for that.RASCOE: Oh, you do not look 50. Oh, my goodness.BAGINSKI: But I really like going out dancing and just the communal experience of just having a good time.RASCOE: Baginski, who's from Chicago, started Earlybirds club last year with her high-school friend, Susie Lee.BAGINSKI: She and I shared this big love of music.RASCOE: They thought they would throw one party and that would be it, but people loved it.BAGINSKI: One woman said to me once, If this were a cult, I would join.RASCOE: So they kept the party going at larger venues in different cities. Now tickets to the roving club sell out at venues across the country. And Baginski's fun idea has become so much more. It's also become an ode to friendship and a celebration of Susie Lee.BAGINSKI: She was an incredible force of nature. She had Stage 4 metastatic breast cancer for five years. I mean, who starts a business with Stage 4 cancer? Susie Lee does because she knew that this would bring happiness to other people and to herself.RASCOE: Susie Lee died in August. She was 49. It's been tough, Baginski tells me, but also a reminder to dance while you still can.BAGINSKI: She wore a hat that said, be here now. She really lived her life that way. And so I try to honor her as best I can, and Helean feels the same way.RASCOE: Helean is Helean Lee, the DJ.HELEAN LEE: I'm Susie's cousin - still getting used to past tense. She is at the heart and soul of everything we do.RASCOE: Helean Lee had been a radio DJ and done some weddings. But before Earlybirds, she'd pretty much hung up her headphones.LEE: One day, Susie asked me - she was like, hey, could you teach you a party? It was at Christmas dinner. My MO in life was to never say no to Susie.RASCOE: When it's not a theme night, recently, they threw a Prince-themed party in Chicago. Helean Lee plays a range of music - hip-hop, R&B, pop - from the early '80s on.LEE: The sweet spot is really, like, '90s.RASCOE: What do you think could be a go-to, like, theme song for Earlybirds Club?LEE: One of Susie's favorites - there's a video of her lip synching to "Survivor" by Destiny's Child, and it's very apt.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RASCOE: When the music starts - again, at 6 p.m. on the dot - women of all ages waste no time hitting the dance floor, like 65-year-old Siobhan Grayson.SIOBHAN GRAYSON: Us older folks, we did this when we were younger.RASCOE: Yeah.GRAYSON: Love that we can do it when we're older.RASCOE: Yeah (laughter).Lindsey Falasca is here for her 40th birthday.LINDSEY FALASCA: A chance to celebrate with my girlfriends without spouses, without kids, and have a damn good time.RASCOE: She has three kids and says, they're going to gymnastics in the morning.FALASCA: I need to sleep, and I need to be awake on time. We have a lot to do tomorrow. But for now, we hang out.RASCOE: Some ladies are just too busy dancing to even stop to chat.Do you mind if I talk with you? I'll dance as we do it. So we can just dance.The dance floor gets cool fast, and the energy is high. While there's definitely some glitter and sequins - I see some women with, like, jewels stuck on their forehead, they look really cool - most people, like me, are wearing flats. I even spot a pair of Birkenstocks, lots of leggings and jeans. The 40th birthday party friends are wearing T-shirts with a sandwich on them and the slogan, let us turnip the beat. People are dressed comfy.MARIANNE TSHIHAMBA: I have counted only one pair of heels in the entire space.RASCOE: Marinne Tshihamba says she came to dance her butt off, not to impress anyone.TSHIHAMBA: This is not about trying to show off...RASCOE: Yeah.TSHIHAMBA: ...But to show out.RASCOE: With the party in full swing, Laura Baginski takes a moment on stage to remember her co-founder and friend.(CHEERING)RASCOE: Earlier, Baginski told me about one of her favorite memories of Susie Lee. It was towards the end of her life. Lee couldn't really dance anymore, but she was on the dance floor anyway. She had put lights on her cane, and she was sitting on a stool, shaking her cane to the beat. You couldn't hold her back, Baginski said.BAGINSKI: And so if she were here right now, she would tell you, dance like a [expletive] maniac.(CHEERING)BAGINSKI: Scream your face off to these lyrics.RASCOE: And I do.(Singing) Snap your fingers, do your step. You can do it all by yourself.I shake it off.(Singing) Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. Shake it off. Shake it off.I leave it all on the dance floor.(Singing) A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me.Oh, this rock 'n' roll, about to rock 'n' roll.I boogie until - wait for it - almost 8 p.m.Yeah. I've been dancing. I'm having a good time. It's 7:42, and I'm already winding down. I've had a full evening. Whoo (ph).And listener, you better believe I was in bed by 10 p.m.(Singing) I saw the sign.Remember, I got stuff to do in the morning.(Singing) I saw the sign.This piece was edited by Samantha Balaban. It was produced by Eleana Tworek, who followed me around on the dance floor with a microphone all night.Whoo (ph).You can find Earlybirds in Phoenix on Friday and San Diego on Saturday. The party is coming back to D.C. in January. I'll see you on the dance floor.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE SIGN")ACE OF BASE: (Singing) It opened up my eyes, I saw the sign. No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong. But where do you belong? Oh, oh, oh, oh.
