MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Today, the defense of the man charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump back when he was running for president. This is Ryan Routh. It took about three hours. Routh was arrested after a Secret Service agent said he spotted him holding a rifle near where Trump was golfing at his West Palm Beach club last year. Routh has pleaded not guilty. The judge allowed him to act as his own lawyer. In presenting his case today, he offered just three witnesses. NPR's Greg Allen was in the courtroom and joins us now from just outside the courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida. Hey, Greg.GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.KELLY: It is unusual - isn't it? - for a defendant to represent himself in a case as serious as this one. How did Routh do?ALLEN: Well, you know, he's not trained as a lawyer. And throughout the morning, he was repeatedly interrupted by the judge, who warned him when he was running afoul of federal judicial rules. He had a lot of evidence he wanted to present, but prosecutors objected to just about all of it, saying it wasn't relevant or otherwise admissible, and the judge agreed. So he had very little evidence.A similar thing happened with witnesses. He had a long list of people he wanted to subpoena, including President Trump. In the end, he was able to call just three witnesses, and he rested his case after just about three hours. By contrast, the prosecution case stretched seven days and involved 38 witnesses.KELLY: So three witnesses he called - who were they?ALLEN: Well, we had two - he had brought in two friends from North Carolina who were there as character witnesses. But his main witness was Michael McClay. He's served as a Marine sniper who saw active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. Routh asked him questions about the SKS-style rifle that was left behind on the golf course. It was never fired that day when Trump was golfing there, and - but it had a scope attached in a makeshift manner using electrical tape. And there have been questions raised about whether that rifle would have worked properly if it had been fired when Trump was there that day.McClay said in court today that when he test-fired the rifle months after Routh's arrest, that it actually malfunctioned. The gun fired, but the second round in the magazine repeatedly jammed, he said. Prosecutors explained that, saying it was likely due to the effects of acid that had been used by investigators to recover the gun's obliterated serial numbers. And they also have said that whether the gun worked well or not really isn't relevant in a charge of attempted assassination.KELLY: I remember, Greg, that Routh was charged with setting up what prosecutors called a sniper's hide near the sixth hole of Trump's golf course. Did Routh in court today - did he do anything to challenge that claim?ALLEN: No. Really, he did not. He's pleaded not guilty to all the charges, but throughout the trial, he's done relatively little to challenge the case against him. Several times during the trial, he seemingly wanted to correct things that he thinks the prosecutors have gotten wrong.We saw that again today in his questioning of the sniper McClay. In his questions, Routh seemed to indicate that an attempt on Trump's life may have been planned while the presidential candidate was golfing on the fifth hole, not on the green of the sixth hole, which is close to the alleged sniper's hiding place. McClay agreed that the use of a long-distance scope made much more sense when fired at a distant target like the fifth hole, which was 375 yards away, and not from the sixth hole where Routh is believed to have been hiding out.KELLY: OK, so they're down to arguing over which hole.ALLEN: Right.KELLY: Closing arguments set for tomorrow. Did you get any clues today as to how Routh plans to proceed?ALLEN: Not really. It's also clearly a concern for U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, the judge in the case. She warned him that his closing arguments must be based on the evidence at the trial. Any deviation, she said, could cause her to shut him down. Today, Routh became frustrated, at one point saying, I have no clue what that means, when the judge talked to him about something. So we'll see what happens tomorrow with closing arguments. And then after that, the federal jury will begin deliberating.KELLY: NPR's Greg Allen reporting now from outside the courthouse there in Fort Pierce, Florida. Thank you, Greg.ALLEN: You're welcome.
