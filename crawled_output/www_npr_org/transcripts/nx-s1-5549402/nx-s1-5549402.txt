MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Yesterday's memorial service for Charlie Kirk felt much like an evangelical worship service, with a call to action.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KARI JOBE CARNES: We need our land healed. We need our country healed.(APPLAUSE)JOBE CARNES: We want the Kirk family to be healed. We want our country to turn back to Jesus.KELLY: That was Kari Jobe Carnes, one of several worship leaders who sang at the service. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon was watching. She joins us for more. Hi, Sarah.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi there.KELLY: So I know you've done so much reporting on evangelical Christians. What stood out to you from this service yesterday?MCCAMMON: Well, you know, it was very much like a church service and very evangelical both in the style of the prayers and the songs and in the messages from the speakers. Charlie Kirk was held up as an example to be followed and even compared to Jesus. Here's Mikey McCoy, who served as his chief of staff.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKEY MCCOY: Charlie, it was the honor of my life to serve you as you served Jesus. And now we will all continue to serve you as we continue to serve Jesus.MCCAMMON: And you could really see during this hours-long service how much the MAGA movement that Kirk was part of has become fused with the Christian right.KELLY: Say more about that. What religious themes leaped out at you?MCCAMMON: Well, Kirk's widow, Erika, called on the audience to reject hate and to forgive Kirk's alleged killer because she said it was what Christ did. That said, though, other speakers drew from very different biblical themes, like divine retribution. Here's conservative commentator Benny Johnson.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BENNY JOHNSON: May we pray that our rulers here, rightfully instituted and given power by our God, wield the sword for the terror of evil men in our nation in Charlie's memory.(APPLAUSE)MCCAMMON: So really, Mary Louise, I heard mixed messages.KELLY: Among the speakers was President Trump. Describe a little bit of what he had to say.MCCAMMON: Yeah. He praised Charlie Kirk. He said his message will live on forever. And Trump said that unlike Kirk and his widow, Erika, who we heard about a moment ago, he wasn't feeling very forgiving.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry. I am sorry, Erika.MCCAMMON: And Trump, along with several other speakers, also described Kirk as a martyr for his faith.KELLY: A martyr - that is a word I've heard a lot. It feels like it's been invoked repeatedly around Kirk's death. What does that mean to people who followed him?MCCAMMON: Well, for many, it evokes the early Christian church - people who were killed for their faith. It carries the notion that there are ideas worth fighting or even dying for. But some Christians are warning against framing Kirk's death in this way. Rachel Roth Aldhizer is among them. She's an evangelical Christian writer based in North Carolina.RACHEL ROTH ALDHIZER: I think using that type of language to refer to our interactions with our neighbors as we're trying to work towards political solutions in an increasingly divided country is a dangerous game. And Christians have to resist that.MCCAMMON: And she says using the language of martyrdom ties the MAGA movement to Christianity in ways that she thinks could be dangerous.KELLY: So what might all of this mean for Kirk's movement going forward?MCCAMMON: Well, there was talk of Kirk's death bringing about both spiritual and political salvation, and the alt-right activist Jack Posobiec predicted that Kirk's assassination will be what he called a turning point in, quote, "the saving of Western civilization." Many speakers said Kirk's death will only strengthen both his religious message and his political movement.KELLY: NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon. Thank you, Sarah.MCCAMMON: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
