LEILA FADEL, HOST:
President Trump is in New York this morning, where he addressed world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. He touted how the U.S. has entered what he called a golden age and then denounced what he called, quote, "uncontrolled migration" around the world. And in the halls of the General Assembly, he accused the U.N. of contributing to the problem.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The U.N. has such tremendous potential. I've always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.FADEL: This comes as Trump is finding himself increasingly isolated at the U.N., where there is a growing push to recognize a Palestinian state. Here to talk about all this is White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Good morning. Thanks for being here.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK. So the president just spoke. What stood out to you?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. He spoke for about an hour, praising the work of his administration, claiming to have turned the country around. But it didn't really start off so well - the speech, that is. I mean, his teleprompter wasn't working. He complained about a broken escalator. And he used those examples of the problems of the U.N. He complained of so much waste and corruption. He even told a story about losing a bid to renovate the U.N. complex so far way back when, using the case as a metaphor of the mistakes that the U.N. often msakes (ph), saying the result was millions in cost overruns, missteps and corruption. But, Leila, he probably saved his most pointed criticism for the U.N. on migration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The United Nations is funding an assault on Western countries and their borders.ORDOÑEZ: He accused the U.N. of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support migrants to the U.S., including providing them shelter and transportation. And he charged that the U.N. was being moved by political correctness and that, in his words, Western nations were losing their countries as a result.FADEL: OK. So he's making a lot of accusations at the U.N., praising himself. Did he address the move by the U.K., France, Canada - important U.S. allies - and others to recognize the Palestinian state?ORDOÑEZ: He did. He called the decision a mistake.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities. This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities.ORDOÑEZ: Now, this position is in line with Israel...FADEL: Right.ORDOÑEZ: ...As well, but it kind of boxes Trump out with the rest of the U.N. I mean, even the secretary-general kicked off the General Assembly saying today that nothing can justify the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, but also nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people - or, as he put it, any form of ethnic cleansing - and called for a ceasefire. Those are tough words that appear to be directed at Israel, as well as the U.S. And they were given just a couple speakers before Trump spoke.FADEL: Right. We also heard the secretary-general say a state is a right, not a reward. The other big conflict happening right now is Russia's war in Ukraine. Did he say anything about putting more pressure on Moscow?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. He's got a bunch of meetings scheduled for the rest of the day this afternoon with leaders of the Middle East about Gaza, but also with European leaders to discuss the war in Ukraine. Trump said in his speech that he was going to speak with European Union about European countries continuing to purchase Russian oil.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?ORDOÑEZ: Now, Trump has increasingly criticized European nations for expecting the U.S. to put pressure on Russia when they can also do more themselves. I mean, it's a really tough moment for Europe as leaders, especially when NATO leaders have struggled to respond to Russia, which has been testing their political will.FADEL: That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Leila.
