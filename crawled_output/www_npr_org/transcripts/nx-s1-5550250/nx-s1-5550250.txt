MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Former Vice President Kamala Harris says in her new memoir that she was the worst person to weigh in on whether former President Biden should have stayed in the race after his flubbed debate performance. She writes it was, quote, "recklessness" to let Biden's decision be a personal one. In an interview last night with MSNBC, Harris added she had a responsibility to say something, and she didn't.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAMALA HARRIS: When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything I'm talking about myself.KELLY: NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram joins us now to talk through more of this memoir. It is called "107 Days." Hey, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey there.KELLY: Start with the fact that Harris talks a lot in this book about Biden, about the friction in her relationship with Biden. What point is she trying to make?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, just to put it in context, this book is really her account - right? - of the 107 days of this historically short campaign that took place last year. It kind of reads like a journal in a way because it's formatted as a countdown to Election Day. But, you know, you're right. She talks about some of the tension between her and Biden and his staff in the West Wing. She criticizes the campaign's talking points after Biden's debate performance as BS, to paraphrase there. And she said that his senior staff mismanaged the reality of Biden's age.She argues that she was loyal to Biden and that loyalty was really important to her, but she also writes about how that loyalty was constantly questioned, even by Biden himself. For example, she said that he called her right before her debate against then-candidate Trump, and Biden was asking her if she was badmouthing him behind the scenes. So the book is airing some of these moments out, and now in the aftermath, trying to draw some of the differences out between her and Biden that she didn't do on the trail, which strategists believe is one of the reasons she wasn't successful. And I will just note, Joe Biden's office declined to comment on anything in the book.KELLY: Yeah. She also wrote about some of her fellow Democrats in this memoir. What'd she say and how are they responding?SHIVARAM: Yeah. She names names particularly in the section where she's talking about her own running mate selection process. She's particularly critical of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who she basically paints as too ambitious for the role of vice president. His office has, you know, pushed back on that. And she said her first choice for VP was actually former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but she thought it would be too much to ask of voters to back a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man. Buttigieg, though, told Politico he was surprised to read that in the book.But I will say, I think the wider reaction from Democratic strategists that I've talked to was just questioning how helpful Harris' recounting of the election really is. Here's Kevin Liao, and he's a strategist based in California.KEVIN LIAO: In this moment, folks are looking forward and trying to figure out, OK, what is this party about to govern, to win elections in the next two cycles and just not seeing how this looking backwards is helpful.SHIVARAM: And Liao says that what's missing from Harris so far is, you know, can she lay out a vision for what Democrats need to be doing in the future to win? He says Democratic voters are looking for leaders to have big ideas right now. And I will say there are tiny bits of that in Harris' book, but for the most part, she doesn't really offer a vision forward for the party.KELLY: What about a vision forward for herself? I mean, Harris has ruled out running for California governor. What about another White House run?SHIVARAM: Yeah. She was asked if she was running again in 2028 last night on MSNBC, and she dodged that question. But of course, as we know, no one really ever answers that question directly. But her immediate future is going on a book tour to promote this memoir. She says that the answers for what's next won't come out of Washington. I do think with a crowded Democratic field, though, in 2028, some of these candidates that you might be hearing from might start campaigning...KELLY: Right.SHIVARAM: ...Sooner rather than later.KELLY: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Thank you.SHIVARAM: Thank you.KELLY: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
