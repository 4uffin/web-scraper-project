TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. In the new TV series "The Lowdown," Ethan Hawke plays a scruffy, stubborn, independent journalist in Tulsa digging into the suspicious death of a powerful man. The show, streaming on FX and Hulu, comes from Sterlin Harjo, the creative force behind the acclaimed "Reservation Dogs." Critic-at-large John Powers loved the series, and after watching the first five episodes of "The Lowdown," he says Harjo hasn't lost his gift for creating a world you don't just want to watch, you want to live in.JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: Jean-Luc Godard once said that there are two kinds of directors. The first kind knows exactly what they're looking for and always aims the camera right there. Alfred Hitchcock may be the supreme version of this. The second kind have wandering eyes that keep searching for unexpected flashes of life. That perfectly describes Sterlin Harjo, the Native American writer and director whose first TV series, "Reservation Dogs," was one of the great shows of the new millennium. Focusing on teenagers from the Muscogee Nation in rural Oklahoma, this groundbreaking series was more circuitous than plotted. Yet episode after episode made you laugh out loud or broke your heart.It's never easy to follow up on a triumph, and I was anxious for Harjo when I heard that his new FX show was a neo-noir story set in present-day Tulsa. Would his drifty, digressive approach work with a crime story? The answer is yes. "The Lowdown," as it's titled, uses its murder plot to create a world crackling with humor and sadness and, well, danger.Ethan Hawke stars as Lee Raybon, a used bookstore owner who moonlights as a muckraking reporter. He drives around in a white van that bears the message, you're doing it wrong. When a son of a powerful Tulsa family supposedly dies by suicide, Lee smells a rat and begins investigating. He's barely begun when he finds himself targeted by neo-Nazis he's called out in print, threatened by the dead man's brother, Donald, a gubernatorial candidate played with slippery ease by Kyle MacLachlan, and tailed by a mystery man named Marty. That's nifty Keith David, the voice of a million documentaries. Along the way, Lee gets involved with a cornucopia of other characters - the dead man's wife, a gossipy antiques dealer, hard-partying cops, caviar counterfeiters - yes, you heard that correctly - and the sardonic publisher of a local Black newspaper who says of Lee, there's nothing worse than a white man who cares.Meanwhile, Lee's ex-wife is about to get remarried, and he's desperate to stay close to his teenage daughter Francis, warmly played by Ryan Kiera Armstrong, who finds her loner dad both absurd and admirable. Both qualities are on display in this early scene, when Lee meets some local big shots at their club. After sniffing a decanter of expensive hooch, he makes a joke about his line of work and is interrupted by a businessman, played by Tracy Letts.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE LOWDOWN")ETHAN HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I should have gone in the investment firm business - huh? - instead of rare books?TRACY LETTS: (As Frank Martin) But you are a journalist, too, though - right? - or some kind of writer?HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I'm a truthstorian (ph).LETTS: (As Frank Martin) Sorry, say again?HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I am a Tulsa truthstorian .LETTS: (As Frank Martin) A truthstorian. What exactly is a truthstorian?HAWKE: (As Lee Raybon) I'm glad you asked. I read stuff. I research stuff. I drive around, and I find stuff. And then I write about stuff. Some people care. Some people don't. I'm chronically unemployed, always broke. But let's just say that I am obsessed with the truth.POWERS: Now, Harjo is steeped in American pop culture, from the Jim Thompson paperbacks that become a plot point, to his pointed use of Oklahoma musicians like Leon Russell and Chet Baker. And surely he knows his Coen Brothers. Watching "The Lowdown," I kept thinking of "Fargo," with its desolate open spaces, oddball humor and crazy quilt of tones. Yet, there's more than a whiff of "The Big Lebowski" here too. Occasionally fuddled and perpetually disheveled, Hawke's Lee could almost be the smart, idealistic brother of Jeff Bridges' The Dude.While Hawke's full-throttle performance carries the show - my he's gotten good - Harjo knows how to keep the other characters surprising. When we first see the dead man's widow, a role nailed by Jeanne Tripplehorn, we think her cold-hearted and scheming. But during a night drinking with Lee, we discover she's something far more complicated. When Peter Dinklage turns up as Lee's great frenemy Wendell, their day-long encounter begins with the two swapping barbs, but then eases into a moving portrait of failure and disillusionment.Because Harjo is something of a truthstorian himself, "The Lowdown" isn't shy about pointing out the pain at the heart of Tulsa's history, most notoriously its 1921 race massacre. Indeed, Lee's bedroom wall is papered with articles about local historical cruelties. Yet Harjo is no hater. He's blessed with a sense of tenderness toward his characters and toward the multicultural Tulsa where he makes his home.He shoots this unglamorous city with knowing affection, from its junky shops and Lee's local diner Sweet Emily's, to the deserted nighttime streets where, as Lee's headlights approach, you can see a cat skitter across the road. We sense that Harjo's view of Tulsa is akin to Lee's. There's bad things about it, but underneath, it's really good. One might say the same of this series, which occasionally meanders or misfires, but whose every episode is bracingly alive. A genuinely life-affirming artist, Harjo turns Lee Raybon's Tulsa into an unexpectedly marvelous place. "The Lowdown" isn't merely a good show. It's also a really good hang.MOSLEY: John Powers reviewed the new TV series "The "Lowdown" on FX and streaming on Hulu.Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll talk with Samin Nosrat, the author of "Salt Fat Acid Heat." Her new book, "Good Things," is filled with recipes, which is surprising since she's long said she hates them. We'll hear how she came to terms with recipes and why she now sees them as a way to bring joy to the kitchen.
