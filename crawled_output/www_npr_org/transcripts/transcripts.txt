Untangling The Science of Octopus Arms
Published on September 19, 2025
Octopuses and their arms are a bit of a mystery.  Not because scientists don’t know how they work; they’re boneless hydrostats, made up of groups of muscles working together and capable of bending, twisting, elongating or shortening — like a frog’s tongue, or an elephant’s trunk. But because scientists are still figuring out how most octopuses use those arms in the wild. Scientists at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole and the marine lab at Florida Atlantic University wanted to answer that question. By analyzing videos taken in the wild, they found that octopuses seemed to prefer doing certain tasks with certain arms… and that the majority of the time, they used their front arms to explore and their back arms to get around. Researchers on the project hope that furthering our understanding of octopus behavior and movement will be useful for developing things like soft robotics.Interested in more science discoveries?

Trump lost the battle. Will he win the "war?"
Published on September 19, 2025
Why is Trump sending the National Guard to cities when crime is already falling?Earlier this month, President Trump posted this: “I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.” He seemed poised to send the National Guard to the city in an attempt to curb crime, after having deployed them in D.C. But this week, he turned his attention to Memphis, signing an order for deployment there and vowing to circle back to Chicago later. And these three cities aren’t the only ones on his radar: Baltimore, Portland, New Orleans, and St. Louis are also bracing for possible deployments. But why send the National Guard – a temporary military force – to these cities when crime has already fallen this year in every single city he’s mentioned? Brittany gets into it with Abdallah Fayyad, policy correspondent at Vox, and Alex V. Hernandez, neighborhood reporter for Block Club Chicago.
