(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE FUTURE FREAKS ME OUT")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) I'm on fire, and now I think I'm ready to bust a move. Check it out, I'm rocking steady, go.AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:
Some might have a hard time remembering the name Motion City Soundtrack, but for superfans of early 2000s pop punk and emo music, their synth and idiosyncratic lyrics are unforgettable.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE FUTURE FREAKS ME OUT")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) What's up with Will and Grace? I don't get drum and bass. The future freaks me out.RASCOE: The band first made their mark with this song, "The Future Freaks Me Out." It spoke to the anxieties of early adulthood. Now, more than 20 years after its release, the band is back with a new record, "The Same Old Wasted Wonderful World."(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHE IS AFRAID")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) I can't explain it. I can't ignore it. All these feelings I felt have been working against me, man.RASCOE: As NPR's Ryan Benk explains, there's still anxiety. It's just grown - like the band and their audience - into middle age.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHE IS AFRAID")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Unless somebody spells it out, I never understand.RYAN BENK, BYLINE: I have had the album on repeat for, like, weeks now.JUSTIN PIERRE: Was this accidentally, or is this on purpose?BENK: (Laughter) This is on purpose. Yes.PIERRE: OK, just checking.BENK: Lead singer Justin Pierre's trademark self-deprecating humor was as much on display in this interview as it is throughout the band's discography. And the first single off this new album is an absolute return to form, a return that Pierre says probably could have happened a lot sooner.PIERRE: I cannot be wrangled. That's one answer.BENK: Wrangling Pierre has been at least a part-time job for guitarist Joshua Cain throughout Motion City's life. But he admits the haywire Pierre also made for good music.JOSHUA CAIN: The reason why now is I feel like it was enough for us to be inspired to write, right? There was periods of our life where we've gone in to try to write a record, and, like, Justin's like, I'm super happy. I don't know how to do this anymore. And then there's...BENK: (Laughter).CAIN: ...But, you know, it's like, I think we need it. It's true. I mean, it's like, what do you write about when you're [expletive] having the best time of your life?(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHE IS AFRAID")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Problems in my head instead of being present, tensions rising in defense. She is afraid of the sounds that I make when I'm around, and she's taking...BENK: Cain's bandmate still struggles with his mental health. But over the years, he's developed better tools to deal with things like anxiety and substance use. Justin Pierre is also more self-aware.PIERRE: I think this might have been the first time I've ever done this, but I was completely dysregulated at rehearsals one day. I think it took me an hour and a half to get it together. I don't know if you knew that's what I was doing.CAIN: Yes, I did.PIERRE: Usually, I just allow myself to be in an anxious, chaotic mess around everybody else, and I just learned, like, this year, that that was affecting people for 30 years. I'm a very slow learner.BENK: OK, maybe a slow learner, but Pierre has always been honest about his struggles. It's there on past albums, social media and the new song "Melancholia."(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MELANCHOLIA")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Why don't you say what you're going through? What's inside of you? What you want to do? Why does it seem like you want to hurt?BENK: Pierre says this song is sort of an internal dialogue, but these questions are also universal. And he's realized his music is as much about his call as it is the response from fans.PIERRE: People would write messages saying, I have this, too, and I have this as well. And I would think, like, wait, what do you mean too and as well? Like, I wasn't aware of all the things that these people were saying to me that I was saying through the music. But what's really cool is that they were all right. They heard something I was doing, and I learned about who I was through the fans that listened to our music.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MELANCHOLIA")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Despair was not part of the plan. No software update can change a man.BENK: The subject matter in form of "Melancholia" is classic Motion City Soundtrack. But just a track later, the song "Your Days Are Numbered" winds down to something much slower and much darker.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Just wait and see. One day I'll disappear and you'll be just like me. I'm not like them.BENK: The ability for a band to switch gears so quickly without giving their listeners whiplash is a skill that Motion City Soundtrack continues to hone. Again, guitarist Joshua Cain.CAIN: I think all of us got a little bit more of ourselves peppered on this record in different ways than we have in the past. Like, it just has a bit of everything for all of us. And I think it's - it feels good.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) No one can stop me now.BENK: When Motion City Soundtrack released their debut album, they sold CDs inside hand-packaged floppy discs out of their van, so they've been making music for a while. But despite touring with some of the biggest acts of the early aughts and their rabidly loyal fan base, their name still hasn't caught on, a fact Pierre and Cain aren't afraid to joke about, like with this reminiscence. It's about a party when they were young.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK WE ARE")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Remember House of Ravers? Or the night that everyone almost died? We were always so damn high.BENK: And it's a song I can't actually say the title of on the radio.CAIN: We needed to come up with a bio for, like, the thing, right? And this is when we were coming back to do shows. And we're like, we don't want to, like, rehash crap, and that was the bio we put there. In our official bio, it was, you know who the f*** we are.PIERRE: Just stupid.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOU KNOW WHO THE FUCK WE ARE")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Defenders of the night collecting stars.BENK: Joshua Cain and Justin Pierre say that after decades of asking themselves who they are, they're finally a lot closer to having an answer at age 49. And as for the future...PIERRE: The future freaks me out, but I also have to believe that hope is still a thing that exists.CAIN: It's pretty easy to look at things and give up, and I'm glad that we've pushed through and gotten to here and now. Everybody else has been pushing through, and hopefully we get to that better place.BENK: Motion City Soundtrack's "The Same Old Wasted Wonderful World" is out now. Ryan Benk, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE SAME OLD WASTED WONDERFUL WORLD")MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK: (Singing) Crash landed...
