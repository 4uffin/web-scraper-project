LEILA FADEL, HOST:
After President Trump cut billions of dollars in global health aid and brought foreign assistance virtually to a standstill, health policy experts have asked, Will the U.S. rebuild a strategy for global health? The State Department tried to answer that question Thursday. NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel has more.GABRIELLE EMANUEL, BYLINE: Officials are calling this the America First Global Health Strategy. The 35-page document has a vision in which the U.S. does not work with NGOs but instead works directly with the governments of lower-income countries to build up their national health systems. Speaking to reporters on background, senior administration officials said the goal is to wean countries off foreign aid.ELISHA DUNN-GEORGIOU: This seems to be the first kind of logical strategy we've seen from them.EMANUEL: Elisha Dunn-Georgiou heads the Global Health Council. The group is suing the administration for the release of funds appropriated by Congress. She says the document is short on details, and many of the ideas outlined aren't new. The U.S. has long collaborated with governments. And the other big idea isn't new, either. It's that diseases should not be siloed into separate aid programs like they have been. We have one for HIV, one for malaria.DUNN-GEORGIOU: It's not a huge change from what the U.S. was trying to do and working on.EMANUEL: However, some parts of the proposal are a break from the past. For example, the U.S. says it will stop funding things like technical assistance and focus on buying commodities for other countries, like medications and diagnostic kits made by U.S. companies. Nina Schwalbe is with Georgetown Center for Global Health Policy and Politics.NINA SCHWALBE: The private sector is all over this document. There's a lot of lip service to more efficient, etc. But really, this is about outsourcing to the private sector.EMANUEL: And many question how this strategy will get rolled out, given that Trump has cut much of the global health systems the U.S. had built up over the years. Jeremy Konyndyk is president of Refugees International and worked in foreign aid in the Biden administration.JEREMY KONYNDYK: It seems to be written in a world in which they have not just demolished U.S. global health assistance and fired all the people who had managed it for years.EMANUEL: Administration officials say they will soon be working with governments to hammer out multiyear agreements and hope to start implementing them next year.Gabrielle Emanuel, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF DEAD SULLIVAN SONG, "WISHUWEREHERE")
