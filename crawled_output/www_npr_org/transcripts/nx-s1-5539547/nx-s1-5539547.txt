Why grocery prices are so high — and what people are doing about it Groceries saw their biggest jump in nearly three years last month, a worrisome sign for inflation-weary shoppers. Tariffs are contributing to higher prices for imported staples like bananas and coffee.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Americans are paying more for a lot of things these days, including health care, insurance and entertainment. And in the coming weeks, NPR will explore what's behind these rising prices and how people are coping. It's part of our series Cost of Living - The Price We Pay. Some of the most painful price hikes have been at the supermarket. And as NPR's Scott Horsley reports, that's not only affecting shoppers' wallets, but their political views.SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Last month saw the biggest jump in grocery prices in almost three years. For Shelia Fields, who lives in Galveston, Texas, the hunt for affordable food has almost become a full-time job.SHELIA FIELDS: Like, yesterday, we went to three different stores here in town, and we bought only what was a really good sale. So we got no meat at all. It's just too high.HORSLEY: Fields and her husband are both retired nurses, and they're worried about outliving their savings.FIELDS: We're not going hungry. We just have anxiety over this and anxiety about our kids and our grandkids. We've been through a lot of recessions. We've been through the one in the '80s and 2008, and this is the scaredest we've ever been.HORSLEY: The Fields are in good company. A survey this summer by The Associated Press and NORC found the cost of groceries has become a major source of stress for about half of all Americans, outpacing rent, health care and student debt. Rebecca White, who works at a bank in Cincinnati, says her paycheck has not kept pace with her rising grocery bills. She's scouring the back of her cupboards for food and eating a lot of spaghetti.REBECCA WHITE: I try to stick to cheaper meals, which isn't always healthy, buying frozen meals or vegetables over fresh ones. Sometimes I'll skip breakfast and then just have lunch and dinner so that I don't have to buy another meal.HORSLEY: The giant Kroger supermarket chain says the stress is apparent as shoppers make smaller, more frequent trips to the store, use more coupons and opt for cheaper, private-label products. White says she's not optimistic about finding relief at the checkout line any time soon.WHITE: Once the prices go up, they rarely ever come back down.HORSLEY: Grocery prices have jumped nearly 30% since February 2020, just before the pandemic. COVID supply shocks were compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which raised food and energy prices around the world, and by avian flu, which triggered the more recent spike in egg prices. The double-digit price hikes came as a shock after decades of relatively stable grocery prices. And David Ortega, who's a food economist at Michigan State University, says shoppers are reminded of those higher prices week after week.DAVID ORTEGA: We all have to eat, and food is very personal. Grocery prices have become a hot-button political flash point over the past couple of years.HORSLEY: President Trump has said repeatedly shoppers' frustration with grocery prices helped put him back in the White House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's such an old-fashioned term, but a beautiful term - groceries. It sort of says a bag with different things in it. Groceries went through the roof, and I campaigned on that. I talked about the word groceries for a lot.HORSLEY: But despite Trump's promise to lower prices, the overall cost of groceries is higher now than when he was sworn in. The president's crackdown on illegal immigration, including the targeting of people who pick and process our food, could add to upward pressure on prices. Ortega notes Trump's tariffs are also contributing to higher prices for imported staples like bananas and coffee.ORTEGA: Tariffs simply are a tax on imported goods. So that raises the costs, and ultimately, consumers see that at the grocery store.HORSLEY: Coffee prices have jumped more than 20% in the last year. While some of that is due to weather in coffee-growing countries like Brazil and Vietnam, Trump's double-digit import taxes are not helping. Shelia Fields stocked up on coffee when the tariffs were announced. She's not sure what she'll do when that supply runs out.FIELDS: I haven't bought coffee in a month, and the prices are just going up up up. We're down to, like, one cup in the morning, and I'd just hate to give that up.HORSLEY: Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.
