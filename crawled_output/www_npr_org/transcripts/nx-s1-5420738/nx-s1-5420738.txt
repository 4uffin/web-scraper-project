MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Tangier Island, Virginia, is one of the last inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay, and it's under threat from climate change. Since 1850, the island has lost two-thirds of its land mass to erosion and sea level rise. Scientists predict it could be almost entirely underwater in the next 50 years. NPR's Julie Depenbrock has this report.JULIE DEPENBROCK, BYLINE: As the ferry approaches Tangier Island, Captain Steven Thomas points out a handful of tiny buildings on stilts in the water.STEVEN THOMAS: Those are all crab shanties. That's where they shed the soft-shell crabs during the summer months.DEPENBROCK: Coming to Tangier feels, in some ways, like going back in time. Many still make a living on the water the way their ancestors did hundreds of years ago, by crabbing and fishing. But Tangier's numbers are dwindling. The most recent census estimate puts the population at 240.Rob Baechtel moved to Tangier with his wife 12 years ago. He meets me at the dock for a tour in his utility task vehicle.ROB BAECHTEL: So up on the right's our fire department. If my pager goes off, you're on your own 'cause I'm the only EMT on the island right now.DEPENBROCK: The island is dotted with crosses and Trump campaign signs, a nod to the residents' Christian and conservative beliefs. Baechtel points to a strip of sand in the distance.BAECHTEL: That's our beach. It's a mile and a half long, and no one's ever on it. The locals don't go there.DEPENBROCK: Why not?BAECHTEL: They're born on the water. They work on the water. They die on the water. They don't play here.DEPENBROCK: To the right, children emerge from a long white building.BAECHTEL: That's our school. It's kindergarten through 12th. We're the last combined school in the state of Virginia.DEPENBROCK: Thirty-eight students attended Tangier Combined School this past year, with just one graduating senior who plans to stay on the island. But many graduates leave. And it's not just people who are disappearing. The fate of the island itself is tenuous. Tangier is just 3 feet above sea level, and every year, the waters rise by at least a quarter of an inch. It may not sound like much, but it's enough to increase flooding and turn areas that were once solid ground into wetlands.DAVE SCHULTE: Our predictions indicated that the island will need to be abandoned in roughly 25 to 30 years.DEPENBROCK: That's Dave Schulte. He's a climate change researcher who's studied Tangier extensively. Schulte says a mix of factors have hastened the island's disappearance - erosion, sea level rise, subsidence - or sinking - and storms.SCHULTE: But again, due to climate change, they are becoming more frequent and intense, causing more damage.DEPENBROCK: Though Schulte's predictions have caught the attention of journalists and politicians, he says...SCHULTE: The help has been slow in coming, if it comes at all.DEPENBROCK: A seawall was constructed on the island's west side in 1990, and a stone jetty to protect the harbor was installed in 2020. But Schulte says both projects took decades to complete.SCHULTE: They can't keep asking for help and wait 50 years for someone to save the island. It doesn't have that much time.DEPENBROCK: Schulte estimates it would cost between 250 and 350 million to protect and restore the island. That would include applying protective stone along vulnerable shorelines.JAMES ESKRIDGE: It's a lot of money for us, but to the government, it's just pocket change.DEPENBROCK: That's Mayor James Eskridge.ESKRIDGE: When I talk about saving Tangier, I'm not just talking about a small piece of land. I'm talking about a culture, a way of life.(SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS SINGING)DEPENBROCK: I visit Cameron Evans by the docks, where he has a business as a photographer, charter boat captain and crabber.CAMERON EVANS: You doing cash?DEPENBROCK: Like many here, he's desperate for solutions.EVANS: I'll agree in anything if it gives us more money, more protection.DEPENBROCK: Evan sees rebuilding the shoreline using dredged material as the ideal. It's being done, he says, on nearby Poplar Island, Maryland. Poplar was also once on the verge of disappearing, but the Army Corps of Engineers is helping to restore the uninhabited island and protect its wildlife. Hilary Harp Falk, president of the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, is working with Tangier to develop an adaptation plan, which could include a living shoreline of marsh grasses and oysters.HILARY HARP FALK: We can look at strategies like the use of dredging materials or beneficial reuse of those materials on the island in order to protect it from those impacts of climate change.DEPENBROCK: Evans, for his part, is committed to staying on Tangier until he sees this kind of restoration.EVANS: Because I feel like if I end up do leaving the island, I want to leave the island in a less vulnerable place in time, you know?DEPENBROCK: After all, Evans says, if it's worth saving an uninhabited island like Poplar, shouldn't Tangier, with its rich history and culture, be worth just as much?(SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS SINGING)DEPENBROCK: Julie Depenbrock, NPR News, Tangier Island, Virginia.MARTIN: And a brief note about that story - Dave Schulte, the climate change researcher whose voice you just heard, died last month. He will be missed.
