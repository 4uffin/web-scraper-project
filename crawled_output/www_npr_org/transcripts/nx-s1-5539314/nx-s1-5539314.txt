MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, began on Monday evening. This year, a synagogue in Brooklyn has added an unusual requirement to the High Holy Days. It is asking for proof of voter registration in order to attend religious services. New York City holds its mayoral election on November 4. NPR's Sarah Ventre tells us about this rare blend of synagogue and state.MARK TREYGER: We are in the beautiful neighborhood of Gravesend in Brooklyn.SARAH VENTRE, BYLINE: Mark Treyger is the CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council, and he used to be the city council member representing this district.TREYGER: We're situated right now in Ocean Parkway that's home to a very vibrant Sephardic - mainly a Sephardic Jewish community.VENTRE: Sephardic Jews have roots in the Iberian Peninsula, but the term can also include Jews from throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Shaare Zion is the largest Syrian synagogue in New York City. Two and a half weeks ago, the synagogue sent a letter to congregants explaining there was a new policy for this year's High Holiday services. If you want a seat, you have to provide proof that you're registered to vote. The reason? The letter says New York City's mayoral election could result in very serious problems and that, quote, "we believe we must put in our best effort to try to avoid a very serious danger that can affect all of us."Shaare Zion declined to talk about their new policy. Scholars who study church-state or synagogue-state relations say they can't recall another house of worship ever taking this kind of step. Treyger is not a member of Shaare Zion, but says the concerns raised in the letter are ones he's heard too.TREYGER: There has been certainly a lot of conversations about public safety and the future of policing and how to handle protest and how to protect shuls and schools.VENTRE: Treyger says these conversations intensified after Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary. The letter does not mention Mamdani or any candidate by name. It doesn't tell congregants what party to register with or who to vote for or against. But Mark Valeri, a professor of religion and politics at Washington University, says the language in the letter says a lot.MARK VALERI: Asking a congregant to register with the implication that it's for the mayoral election in a Jewish congregation implies very much a divine sanction for voting and perhaps leaning one way or the other. My surmise is there is fear of Mamdani being elected.VENTRE: Valeri says because of the letter's careful wording - that it doesn't name a candidate or tell people how to vote - there's no obvious legal issue with it, but it's still highly unusual.DAVID BLEICH: It is terribly unusual. But the question isn't whether it's unusual. Is it permissible?VENTRE: This is Rabbi David Bleich. He's a high-ranking and respected rabbinical authority at Yeshiva University in New York. And when he asks whether it's permissible, he means according to Jewish law. As in, can a Jew be denied entry to High Holiday services for not registering to vote?BLEICH: On what grounds would a religious organization impose all sorts of conditions that has nothing to do with religion or spirituality?VENTRE: Rabbi Bleich says synagogues often have membership requirements, and he thinks people should vote. But combining the two - having requirements in order to attend services - it doesn't sit well with him. In fact, he calls it ludicrous.Sarah Ventre, NPR News, New York.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
