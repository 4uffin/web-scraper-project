AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Time now for "My Unsung Hero," our series from the team at the Hidden Brain podcast. "My Unsung Hero" tells the stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else. And today's story comes from Lara Friedman. Lara and her partner have a rottweiler named The Dude. He's a big dog, but he's super sweet and usually easy to walk. But The Dude is terrified of fireworks, and this posed a problem one evening in July when Lara took him for a walk in their Washington, D.C., neighborhood.LARA FRIEDMAN: And out of nowhere, fireworks started. I mean, they were, like, right on top of us. You could smell them. And The Dude flipped out. He went into total panic mode, flight mode. And so I weigh about 135 pounds. He weighs almost 120. And it was slippery. It had been raining. And he is just going to drag me, and I realize there is no way I can get the two of us home safely. And I'm standing in front of a house just frozen, and, like, fireworks keep going off. And a guy walks by - I'm pretty sure his name was Blake. In my panic, I don't really remember his name. And he said, hey, poor dog. He seems scared. And he tried to comfort The Dude a little bit.And I started to cry, which is - I don't cry a lot. It was weird. And he said, are you OK? And I said, I can't get him home safely. And, you know, there another firework went off. And he said, do you - would it help if I walked you home? I can try to help control him. And I said, oh, that's sort of - I feel weird saying this, but yes, that would be helpful. So he went to check in his house, and then he came back with a friend, and the two of them tried to help me hold The Dude, but it was really hard.And we couldn't figure out how I was going to get him home. And Blake says, well, you know, I have a car. Would he get into a car? And I said, I think he would. Can you bring it over? I can't walk him to your car. And this total stranger, his friend, Bubba, helped me hold The Dude. And Blake went around the corner and picked up his car and drove around, and we opened the back door of the car. And I walked over and I called The Dude, and he ran directly into the car. And then this kind stranger drove us home.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FRIEDMAN: So, Bubba and Blake, I don't know what would have happened - I don't know how that night would have turned out without these two angels who came to my rescue and to The Dude's rescue. But I am so grateful, and we will absolutely be paying this forward.CHANG: Listener Lara Friedman of Washington, D.C.
