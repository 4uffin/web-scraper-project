The basics of road safety might seem obvious, but they can save your life. DON'T cross the street where drivers might not expect you. DO use sidewalks, bike paths and safe pedestrian crossings whenever possible. DO make yourself visible with bike lights (red on the back and white in the front) and reflective clothing. DO pay attention to your surroundings, look up from your phone when walking and avoid wearing headphones.
