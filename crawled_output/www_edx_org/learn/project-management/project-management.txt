Unlike traditional project management strategies, Agile prioritizes adaptability and innovation through collaboration and responsiveness to change.Projects are not completed in a vacuum — internal and external circumstances constantly evolve. To maintain progress and remain competitive, project managers must be ready to adapt. Agile techniques allow teams to stay flexible and find new, effective ways to meet goals.By employing Agile project management strategies, managers can:Prioritize innovationEngage stakeholdersImprove organizational decision-making skillsBoost morale through periods of changeIncrease acceptance of changeHow to get started in project management1. Earn a degree and real-world experienceFor many project managers, the first step toward building a career in project management is earning a bachelor's degree and gaining professional skills. Because project management isn't an entry-level role, professional skills like organization, communication, and leadership must come from general work experience and professional development resources like online courses.“Very few people actually start out saying, ‘I'm going to be a project manager,’” Heinlein said. “Many people are accidental project managers. And really, once people discover the value of project management skills, both for their personal life and their careers, they usually stick with it. And that's where training and education are so critical.”People frequently gain experience in a particular industry before pursuing project management roles. For example, people with years of experience completing large-scale coding projects may eventually become project managers in the computer science field.2. Find an apprenticeshipLearning project management takes experience. Many project management professionals work as apprentices at the beginning of their project management careers. Controlled failure under a mentor can help apprentice project managers embrace new techniques without disrupting the project's outcome."Mentorship in this field isn't optional, it is accelerant," says Jamilyn Trainor, founder and senior project manager at Müller Expo Services International. "Project managers grow by hearing why decisions were made, not just what was done. A good mentor will shave years of your learning curve away."3. Sharpen soft skillsNo matter the industry, project managers work with people first and foremost. To maintain progress, they must keep their teammates engaged, motivated, and enthusiastic about completing projects.Work to heighten executive leadership skills like communication, conflict management, and problem-solving. These skills can help you strengthen relationships and create a psychologically safe environment that encourages innovation, creativity, and teamwork.4. Network with project professionalsGain insights by speaking with project management professionals. Speak with people from diverse industries for unique perspectives that can help you navigate any situation.You can network by participating in project planning groups, online communities, and events like conventions and conferences. Demonstrating a willingness to learn new project management strategies may even help you earn referrals from peers.5. Refine your résuméProject management is a rigorous field with defined targets. Your résumé should include specific examples citing when organizations benefited from your project management. Consider including these three crucial performance indicators:Time: This shows that you delivered your projects within the given timeline, minimizing potential labor costs.Cost: This shows you completed the project within the proposed budget, earning the organization more revenue.Quality: This shows that your management was effective.How long does it take to learn project management?It can take several years to become a project manager.
