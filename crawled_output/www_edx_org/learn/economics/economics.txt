It examines how markets work, how wealth is distributed, and how scarce resources are allocated. While the stock market can be a reflection of the economy, economics seeks to more broadly understand how people, businesses, and countries choose to spend their money.Economic theory is widely studied around the world by researchers who seek to better understand the impact of certain policies or shocks on the economy. What is the effect of rising gas prices on household spending? How does incurring larger debt affect an individual's long-term financial health? Will spending on government health care programs cause inflation? Researchers and economists aim to answer these kinds of questions using economic theories, historical trends, and data sets.Benefits of learning economicsYou can experience the benefits of learning economics by taking just one economics class.

Instead, governments can use deficit spending to jump-start the economy.Laissez-faire capitalism: Unlike Keynesian economics, laissez-faire capitalism advocates for little to no government involvement in the economy. Most Western nations followed this economic theory until the Great Depression.Marxism: Developed in the 19th century by German philosopher and theorist Karl Marx, Marxism proposes that workers should own their labor and not merely receive a salary.
