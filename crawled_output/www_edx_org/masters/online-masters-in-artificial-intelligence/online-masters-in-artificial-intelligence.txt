These graduate programs go beyond the subjects learned in a bachelor's degree program in a coding-related field to cover more intermediate and expert-level courses, such as those in the following list:Courses: Learn how to use , including Python, C++, and Java, and explore programming syntax, coding logic, and script creation.: Discover how to train machines to perform a wide range of tasks and evaluate collected data.: Consider the ethical implications of AI models and explore ways to promote the fair and responsible use of AI.: Apply critical thinking and
to the development and operation of state-of-the-art AI tools.A long-term look at AI: Explore the societal, ethical, and legislative aspects that will shape the future of AI.SkillsMachine learning: With machine learning, software is trained on large datasets to understand and draw conclusions with little or no input from humans. Machine learning is a key tenet of artificial intelligence.: Using artificial intelligence requires a strong working knowledge of programming languages and their applications. You can learn to build your own programs with AI elements or integrate them into existing software.: By developing this skill, you can improve how developers and end users utilize human language to interface directly with computers.: Data science takes large, raw sets of information and assesses them so that people can draw conclusions and create visually appealing materials. Organizing data is crucial for functional artificial intelligence processes.Critical thinking: Artificial intelligence has many moving parts, which can lead to various issues requiring careful troubleshooting. Critical thinking allows AI master's students to navigate these issues and problem-solve accordingly.Cost and financial aid for a master's in artificial intelligenceTuition costs can vary significantly among online master's in artificial intelligence programs, depending on factors like a school's public vs. private status, location, and prestige. Some programs may cost as little as $35,000, while others climb to $65,000 or more in tuition alone.On top of this sticker price, you'll need to consider factors like textbooks and materials, technology requirements, and costs associated with potential campus visits. Fortunately, you can lower your financial burden:Prioritize "free" financial aid: Sources like scholarships and grants provide need-based and achievement-based funding without the need to pay them back. Before taking on any loans, research any available funding from these sources and find out how much you qualify for when you fill out the FAFSA.Use loans: Though they carry interest, loans allow you to focus on your education rather than worrying about how to pay for it.Seek fully online programs: Fully online programs remove the need to relocate or commute to campus, saving you money. Asynchronous programs also offer savings opportunities by allowing you to complete your schoolwork around any professional obligations.What jobs can you get with a master's in artificial intelligence?As AI becomes increasingly integrated across various industries, new career opportunities may continue to emerge. Here are some of the
can pursue:Develop programs and predictive models that improve how machines process information, perform tasks, recognize patterns, and solve problems.AI developersDesign and implement artificial intelligence programs to perform duties such as making data-driven predictions.Use machine learning to collect and interpret large quantities of data, gain valuable insights, and share findings with key stakeholders.Computer and information research scientistsCreate and improve software and hardware to solve complex problems.AI consultantAssist organizations with
to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and streamline repetitive tasks.Salary expectations for a master's in artificial intelligence degreeMaster's in AI degree program graduates — depending on their work experience, industry, and employer — may earn higher-than-average salaries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), three popular AI-related roles earned the following median annual salaries in 2024:$112,590Data scientists$140,910Computer and information research scientists$131,450Software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testersCareer outlook for master's in artificial intelligenceThe BLS projects that several jobs that incorporate advanced AI knowledge will grow faster than the average 3% for all occupations in the U.S. between 2023 and 2033. This is likely due to AI's prominence in our lives and organizations' interest in using AI to grow their business.
