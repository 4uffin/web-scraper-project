Heartfelt and funny, the film follows three sisters who return to their childhood home for a momentous weekend: the third wedding of their twice-widowed mother, Diana Frost (Kristin Scott Thomas). The three daughters are from vastly different walks of life: Katherine (Scarlett Johansson) is a Captain in the Royal Navy; Victoria (Sienna Miller) is a Hollywood star; and Georgina (Emily Beecham) is a hospice nurse. Over the weekend, the family gathers to celebrate the new marriage, but mother and daughters alike are forced to revisit the past and confront the future, all with help from a colorful group of unexpected wedding guests.

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
“My Mother’s Wedding” neatly juxtaposes its subplots with the joyous event that serves as its centerpiece. The wedding allows Scott Thomas to bring in several minor characters for an effective moment or two.
Rated: 3/4

The film was originally titled ’North Star.' Yet, despite a few moments of connection and insight, that is precisely what this story is missing.
Rated: 2.5/4

Associated Press
It’s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren’t guarantees that a movie will work.
Rated: 2/4

If she chooses, Kristin Scott Thomas could give Nancy Meyers and Nicole Holofcener some stiff competition in the family dramedy game.

My Mother's Wedding is, ultimately, a gentle and restrained family reunion that seeks to reflect on grief, memory, and fraternal bonds without daring to completely shake those foundations. [Full review in Spanish]

Thomas, pulling from her own experiences, understood the assignment and delivered a nice warm blanket, sprinkling in the right amount of laughs in My Mother's Wedding.
Rated: 6/10

I wanted to love it but the pacing needed improvement and it felt a little disconnected. It was okay.
